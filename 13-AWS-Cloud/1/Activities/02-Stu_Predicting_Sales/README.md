# Predicting Sales with Linear Regression

## Background

You and some friends created the ultimate child seat. It's a light and resistant seat that can be folded and stored in a backpack; it's the perfect solution for families traveling with children or people sharing their cars to take their kiddos to the school.

You want to spread the word about your invention, so you decided to run a digital marketing campaign using online ads. After running the campaign for a few days displaying different ads per day, you want to create a model to predict the expected sales depending on the number of ads you decide to show on the internet.

You realized that this is an excellent opportunity to use your linear regression skills to create a prediction model.

## Instructions

Follow the following steps to create a linear regression model to predict sales based on the historical data provided.

1. Load and visualize the sales data.

2. Prepare the data to fit the linear regression model.

3. Build the linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` module of Scikit-learn.

4. Plot the best fit line for the sales prediction model.

5. Use the linear regression model to predict the sales with 100 ads manually.

6. Make predictions using the `predict` function of the `LinearRegression` module.

7. Use the original data (the `X` and `y` sets) to assess the linear regression model using the score, r2, mse, rmse, and standard deviation metrics.
