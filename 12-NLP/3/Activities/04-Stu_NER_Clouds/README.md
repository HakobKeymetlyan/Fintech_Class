# NER Clouds

In this activity, you will extract named entities of your own choosing from the Reuters Corpus and build a word cloud from these entities.

## Instructions

1. Choose one or more NER categories from the Reuters Corpus to extract from the Reuters stories with the category "gas." You may wish to sample a few stories to determine what kinds of NER categories would best summarize the articles.

2. Extract all entities of the types you chose from the stories.

3. Create a word cloud with the extracted NER categories.
