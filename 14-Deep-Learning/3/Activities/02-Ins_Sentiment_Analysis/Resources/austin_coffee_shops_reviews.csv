Coffee Shop 66,"Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in Date Night: Austin, Ambiance in Austin BEAUTIFUL!!!! Love the ambiance! Instagram-worthy!!!  Definitely $$$, so be prepared. This is gonna cost you a pretty penny :) Waffle dessert was just decent...nothing to rave about.  But, will probably be back just to be somewhere unique and nice.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,Very cool decor! Good drinks Nice seating  However...  Just about everything is overpriced. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a cortado. No WiFi Music is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several tables were dirty when we got there. Service is average.  It feels like a Los Angeles coffee shot that is out of place.,0
Coffee Shop 66,"They are located within the Northcross mall shopping center facing east toward Burnet Rd with plenty of parking. I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

Coffee Shop 66,"Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado",1
Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Coffee Shop 66,3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in Americano This is not your average cute study spot cafe.  Location/ Atmosphere: + Easy parking at the lot + Cute and classy interior decor! + Plenty of seats available (couches, swings, high chairs, etc) + Games like chess & tic tac toe available - No sign of outlets/ charging port on the walls - No wifi available - Not a study cafe unless you have all your papers printed out and don't need the internet  Service: o You order by yourself using an iPad up at the counter. + There are 3 iPads available making lines go by faster. + You can request them to text you upon your order being ready + When I told one of the baristas that the fork bin was empty, he kindly brought it over to our table along with a couple of knives! - There was no option to make drinks half sweetened/ less ice on the iPad screen :""(  Food/ Prices: + Highly recommend the Matcha Latte (it was thick and made to perfection!) + The chicken and waffle was well seasoned! + Aesthetically super cute - I didn't enjoy the Milk Tea as much (It was way too sweet for me and had a super unique taste to it.) - Snack size portions, $$ Price tag of a Meal - The sides of corn/ coleslaw came out in a tiny cup - It was ~$7 for a cup of milk tea and ~$8 for the snack sized Chicken and Waffle - We were still pretty hungry after and even considered driving over to Tarka for some real food.  I'd come here again to socialize (when I'm less busy with schoolwork) but really only for the Matcha Latte & the classy atmosphere.

Coffee Shop 66,This is such a cute little cafe! I've driven by this place many times and hadn't noticed it until today. Glad I stopped-the famous chicken waffle was delish!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Beautiful eccentric coffee shop with a library of peculiar books.  Swings, couches, and pillow corners for cuddle puddles.  Coffee with mint and ways you've never imagined coffee could be made. Try the matcha green tea with soy, creamiest matcha I've ever had.  First time here and already my favorite coffee bar so far.

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again. Double espresso with tonic water. Beautiful Macha A beary lovely mocha!",1
Coffee Shop 66,Really love the atmosphere here! I frequent coffee shops and this one is definitely unique and worth checking out.  Pros: great atmosphere Friendly staff Good hangout/ study environment Beautiful lighting Tasty drinks  Cons: no wifi Slightly pricey Pretty things Love all the details here. It just has good vibes. Definitely the perfect cafe atmosphere. See all photos from Sierra L. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Check out this video for a review! youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ki…  Cool new place in Austin! It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun. One thing is that there's no internet, so don't plan on coming here to get stuff done!  You get to order on an ipad! yay.  Pros: - the drink choices are really great. You can get something that you want. You can even get beer here. - great for pictures and enjoying some time off. Sit on a swing ... while playing chase. - parking is plentiful in the plaza area. - friendly baristas  Cons: - food menu isn't too big, but that's okay. Not gluten free for the wife. - very pricey. If you need a place to come on a weekly basis, you're going to need to be a balla.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3.",1
Coffee Shop 66,So much aesthetic in this place. I love every corner of this coffee shop. The only downside is there's no wifi. Their matcha latte is to die for! See all photos from Rojean S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought, just a cafe with a couple of food options. The Nutella waffles we got were on point - there's also a chicken option.  The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options. I hope they add more items to the menu! Milk tea - humongous!! Nutella banana waffles Love the illustrations! See all photos from Ramya B. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,"The greeting of an atmosphere it feels I created. This place speaks to my free spirited soul, with matcha lattes, swings inside that still fit in, pillows, and waffles. This might be the next artist home where computers aren't encouraged by the architecture, but books, talking and chess are. Matcha latte with lactose free milk and house book",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Craft coffee drinks, tea, and beer/wine. Friendly staff, good music and nice atmosphere complete with with a few rope swings from he ceiling. And let's not forget the amazing waffles!! Nice place to chill with friends.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated prices and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Guys, this place is amazing. Limited food menu but both waffle offerings will blow you away! Crazy good spices on the chicken. The coffee and matcha were both stellar as well. Service was friendly and efficient. The space is stunning and cozy. Highly recommend. Will be my new go-to relaxation spot in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks. Highly recommended, so get here when you can!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is amazing! No wifi, but that's fine. it's meant to be a place to hang out with friends, socialize or by yourself reading a good book!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I never write Yelp reviews, ever. But when I walked in here it felt like I was in a hipster Alice in wonderland. The decor is spot on and they left no details out. The Marymint Monroe is really amazing and the chicken and waffle is really good. The staff is so wonderful too, you could tell they really love what they're doing. The swings are a nice touch too!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit. You will want to try their swing for sure. Seating space is somewhat limited and no wifi is available, so be aware. This is more like a place for you to enjoy its atmosphere. Drinks were good, though make sure you have enough in your bank account because their drinks are probably not for broke college students. That swing!",1
Coffee Shop 66,I really enjoyed my visit here. I ordered the cortado and chicken waffle. Both were excellent.  The space is very Instagram worthy.  Awesome mural. Staff was very friendly too and I loved the iPad ordering system. Chicken waffle and cortado paired with sparkling water to cleanse the palate,1
Coffee Shop 66,"7 check-ins The Factory Cafe is overall such a beautiful and really cool place to just hang out with friends or work on homework. You'll probably see the people around you taking the time to perfect their aesthetic Instagram pictures and Snapchat stories (myself included). Although the cafe itself doesn't provide wifi, it's within range of other places with wifi so that shouldn't deter you from going! This place looks like it literally came straight off of Pinterest! So cute!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"My only complaint and desire and heart wish is for this place to be open longer and to allow for Wifi. This place makes my heart happy, it motivates me to study because I want to come here, and it makes me wish I had time to settle and read a wonderful book. The atmosphere is PERFECT, the workers are GENEROUS AND KIND, it's a beautiful place to be.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces.

Coffee Shop 66,"Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!  This place has homemade pop tarts!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is really nice. They have done a great job... It's the type of place that you could spend hours in. They have a small menu right now, but their drinks, waffles, and pastries are really well made. We'll definitely be coming back soon.... like tomorrow. Viva Matcha Latte and Pop-art",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I got waffle wasted at The Factory!!! Not your average coffee shop! Super social without wifi, novel idea!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Honestly, this place is having an identity crisis. Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute decor (props to the designer), but music is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed art of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay open till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a beer/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the owners will rethink their direction. Would I come back? Eeh, too many other treats to entice my attention.",0
Coffee Shop 66,Marymint Monroe  + Chicken and waffles samich = my favorite cafe in Austin.  ... Ohhh and decor is pretty sweet too,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Cute, eclectic furniture and lots of things to do! Gorgeous seating vignettes, lots of space, classy decor. Only thing to watch out for--no wifi...not really a place to do work or study, but great place to chill! My friends and I (6 of us total) found space to play a board game, and had a blast!",1
Coffee Shop 66,This place is fantastic! Ideal place for grabbing a frothy matcha latte and a chicken & waffle. A bit different in the way that you order. Definitely a nice hang-out for millenials or anyone who works in the area and is on a lunch break. Wifi is within reach but they don't have it themselves.,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Enthusiastic and earnest desire to be excellent, try new things and develop new menu ideas, smiles, not in your face - best almond pound cake I've ever had (worth the 5 stars alone), and a fantastic cup of red rooibos iced tea.  next to Hanabi.  fantastic new spot.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"The factory is gonna be my new coffee spot. No words can describe the Amazing atmosphere upon walking in. Comfortable seating, hip music, great interior finishes and table games. The intuitive ipad ordering system was quite fascinating as well with its ease of use. Great service and tastes great! Great job!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love this place. I really appreciate the lack of wifi. Makes it much easier to have good conversations or lose yourself in a good book. Agree that it's a bit pricey, but the drinks are really good.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Great coffee, food and atmosphere! Love the set-up. Order on an iPad and they call your name out when your food is ready.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Super cute place for lounging and chatting up with a friend. The chicken and waffle was delicious. Chicken was cooked to perfection! Super moist chicken with fluffy waffle...more of a snack than a meal, so don't go here expecting to be filled with a meal.",1
Coffee Shop 66,First time checking this place out first time. Pretty swag. Nice assortment of drinks. I got the 15 minutes of fame. Also got the poptart. Delicious!  Next time I'll try the Marymount Monroe. Will definitely come back soon.,1
Coffee Shop 66,"The matcha lattes are amazing! Great atmosphere, great food and drink, and everything is plated beautifully. The kind of place where you can tell the employees take pride in their work. I'll definitely be back often.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"First to Review The Factory is AWESOME! What a great spot! I had the chicken and waffles (new take, but I now have cravings for them!), the homemade Poptart was so fun and such a delight. In terms of beverages got the drink with the chicory in it (I'm a big chicory fan) and it was perfect!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This spot is super cute (""like eating in a Pottery Barn""), with drinks that are unique and with a somewhat limited menu. We tried the chicken and waffles, which was surprisingly delicious and our drinks were also tasty. I had the Livin La Vida Mocha and my husband had the pour over. I will definitely return with company, but prices weren't good enough to make this a regular stop in our rotation.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love the Factory. Good coffee, tasty chicken and waffles and awesome atmosphere. Definitely recommend the Nutella waffle.",1
Coffee Shop 66,AMAZING atmosphere! I walked around for 5 minutes looking at everything before even ordering.  Most unique take on chicken and waffles I've ever had. Hands down best night time hangout in North Austin. P.S.... their Matcha Latte is to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"I am very impressed with this place. The food portions were so perfect and not mention delicious! The waffle architects (staff) were all so accommodating and nice. We were able to talk to one of the owners for a bit and he was very helpful with his recommendations and accurate. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back when I am in Austin again. Nutella and Banana waffles. Chicken and Waffles, Olive Oil Pound Cake, and Milk Tea! Yummy.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful art.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very expensive for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.",0
Coffee Shop 66,Amazing coffee! Waffle banana and nutella is incredible! Beautiful place! The service is great! Everything is just perfect!,1

Coffee Shop 68,"My wife and I used Sophie and her team to organize all the details of a 1914-themed party to celebrate the 100th birthday of our house.  Every detail was perfect (and there were LOTS of details: vintage dance lessons, tin type photography, absinthe fountains and period decor and snacks), her team was delightful and everyone who came had a fantastic time.  We've hosted countless parties, and I can confidently say that this was the best one we have ever had, thanks to Sophie.  I highly recommend their services.",1
Coffee Shop 68,"I have worked with Sophie and her team and they are just such a pleasure! Fantastic and actually vintage pieces, great attention to detail, and so many different and creative ways to customize each party and make it your own. And she crafts too! I bought one of her lovely china tea cup stands for a friends Christmas gift and it was absolutely marvelous, just like everything else Sophie touch! Can't wait to work with you again, Sophie! I wish I could have my own tea party!",1
Coffee Shop 68,"Sophie and her marvelous staff hosted my engagement/ our birthday party. It was a 1020s themed putting on the ritz.

She put so much detail into my party, it was better than I could ever imagine. Thank you so much for the best night ever and taking all the stress away.",1
Coffee Shop 68,"Sophie hosted an amazing vintage tea party for my daughter's girl scout troop. The decor was beautiful, she creates a wonderful atmosphere. The girls had an amazing time and loved every minute of it. My daughter even asked if she can have a tea party for her birthday. It was just a wonderful experience. Thank you Sophie!",1
Coffee Shop 68,"First to Review Loved having Sophie come out and put together a tea party at my house...she is a doll and so professional. Enormously helpful that she also offers vintage hair and makeup services; my girlfriends and I were able to go all out! Definitely a unique experience...it's not your grandmother's tea party, that's for sure  :)",1
Coffee Shop 68,"Sophie at Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Company was absolutely amazing to work with. She puts in a huge amount of time and effort into planning exactly what you want at a budget you are comfortable with. What I especially liked about this was the fact that she's willing to let customers handle certain aspects of the event if they'd like to make their budget smaller. For example, she suggested we purchase our own flowers at wholesale. She also has connections with a liquor merchant in Austin that allows you 15% off your alcohol purchases for the event--a fantastic deal! In terms of venue, a MVTPC celebration can be hosted anywhere in the Austin areas--Sophie was more than willing to drive to Round Rock to make our celebration happen. Finally, Sophie's attention to detail and vast selection of vintage decor and delicious menu selections are sure to make your celebration a HUGE success!",1
Coffee Shop 68,"I randomly ended up and at one of these vintage tea parties a few months ago for one of my buddy's 30th B-day! What a delightful experience! I have no point of comparison, because there is nothing like this in Texas, and for all i know the states! I was invited and prompted to dress in a colorful vintage suit, as the theme for our gentlemen's tea party was FILM NOIR. Delicious fresh pastries, beer, whiskey, tea, laughs, and french gypsy jazz music accompanied our afternoon! Sophie, our fabulous host and owner is on to something! Sophie and her ladies, catered to all our needs and ensured a beautiful memory i will never forget!",1
Coffee Shop 68,Omg Sophia the owner is amazing. She is so professional and delightful to work with. Her inventory of  decor is so beautiful .I threw a mad hatters tea party bridle shower for a dear friend and rented  all the decor from the marvelous vintage tea party co. It helped really set off my party. Everybody was amazed .Sophia is a angel and would highly recommend her to anyone.,1
Coffee Shop 68,"Sophie !  Is simply amazing ! She made my event beyond wonderful. It was a lovely unique baby shower!  The marvelous vintage tea party was beyond my expectations ! The food was delicious, the decor was astounding , and not to forget the amazing miss Sophie and staff were very professional  and excellent. I highly recommended this amazing company for anyone's party !",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins Vintage heart has the best cold brew in Austin. There I said it. I've worked at a few coffee shops and I still give them this kudos.  I love this east side coffee shop. It's cozy, the staff is friendly, most of the patrons keep to themselves while they work on laptops, read, etc.  Always a pleasure to return. Looking forward to the next visit.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins I've tried the hot tea, peach oolong iced tea, and spinach croissant * Hot tea: Ordered the fruity black tea on a teapot. Keeps me awake and pretty tasty. Can ask for more hot water for free. * Peach Oolong: refreshing with a hint of sweetness. Served in a mason jar. * Spinach Croissant: they can warm it up. The croissant was a good size and can be a filling meal. Bread is nice and crisp, wish there's more of the cheese and spinach fillings though.  Atmosphere * Very homey. The space seems a bit small but its never too crowded. You may want to sit near the entrance if you prefer natural lightings. * There's a tall seating area with hanging lights up front, while the other half of the space is filled with small wooden tables and chairs. They also have a sofa all the way at the back. * There's some small tables and chairs outside for extra outdoor seatings. Almost no one ever sit outside though (perhaps because they will be looking directly at a cemetery across the street? Not sure) * Temperature is perfect!!!!! No need to bring extra layers. * I cant seem to get connected to the wi-fi when I sit closer to the front area of the store, but if you sit closer to the back then the wi-fi is great. There's also plenty of electric outlets everywhere. * The place is generallt pretty quiet, a mix of people chatting and people studying or doing work. There's always a handful of UT students, but most of the crowds seems to be non-students.  * Location: Right across a cemetery. It is also next to kebabalicious. There's a small parking lot at front and back side of the store, as well as street parking around the area.  * Service: This place probably have one of the friendliest staffs in Austin. Food and drinks are also prepared quickly.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Don't really get the hype / high ratings this place has. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly fine, in a good location, has nice seating options and the baristas treated me well.  But there's also not much about it that made it stand out to me and the coffee was good but not great.  Worst of all, both times I went in there it smelled badly like a wet towel, which might actually put me off from returning, even thought I only live a flew blocks away. Looks like I'm not the first to notice this, so I hope the management tries to fix it!",0
Coffee Shop 76,"Cozy, warm and comforting...all the makings of a go  to local coffee house in east Austin. The cortado was bold and the cafe au lait was filled with frothy warm milk to top off a smooth drip coffee. There's not much in the area besides a few food trucks, so come with a good book or work!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Excellent space for a bit of studying, low-key work, or reading. Not overly intimate, but plenty of lighting and a casual vibe. Friendly barista and good coffee makes it a spot worth stopping if you're in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"This was hands down my favorite coffee shop during my short stay in Austin.  The atmosphere was cozy and even though there was only one girl as cashier and barista, she was fairly quick taking orders and making the drinks which was impressive!  The syrups they offer (vanilla, mocha, and cinnamon) are all made there which is awesome.  I tried a soy vanilla cinnamon latte and although the cinnamon overpowered the vanilla I still enjoyed the drink.  I highly recommend this coffee shop! Vanilla cinnamon latte",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Cute coffee place to meet a friend or read. Not great for working (not a ton of outlets or space), but still a cute coffee shop. There is a little parking in the front and some in the back, but most likely will have to part on the street in the back.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Updated review 3 check-ins Cutest little coffee shop in town. So hip and perfect for reading a book or enjoying a quiet cup of coffee. The vibe is chill and relaxed and the decor is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic.  I normally get lattes here and they are hot, not too sweet and delicious. The americanos are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass), the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone croissant which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each, but I think their vendor went out of business....? The croissants are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea. Not sure what food they offer there now since I've moved from ATX, but I feel 100% confident that they only select the best of vendors.  Fav fav coffee shop in town and located near other cool east side hotspots! #synergy",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Vintage Heart Coffee is by far the best coffeehouse to study/read/work in Austin. The shop has very vintage and cute Decors. Background music is not overwhelming and it is a quiet coffeehouse! it is pretty small but has plenty of seating. Outlets everywhere, that's always a pls!  My favorite coffees are lavender iced latte and vanilla iced latte. Very strong coffee flavor with fresh milk and their homemade flavors. Fantastic!  Love this place. I always feel very accomplished coming here and getting things done. Ps. The staffs are very nice, they let you bring food truck food here.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"5 check-ins Cute shop where coffee is no joke. Ask about the homemade syrups! Mocha, lavender, vanilla and rosemary.  Fave concoctions: + iced soy vanilla latte (the best!) + cold brew with mocha syrup + almond milk + lavender - vanilla latte Iced lavender and vanilla soy latte!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Let's get to the heart of the matter: their vanilla iced latte is amazing. Ok, above else, protect your heart. By taking an amazing blissful walk to Vintage Heart Coffee. Or drive there, whatever your heart desires.  Justin and I loved this awesome local Austin gem. The inside was nothing special. It was small and cute. They had a couple of chairs outside right next to a mini food truck park. It was sunny and we were able to enjoy the local austin wall mural art. This place is also walking distance from Franklin BBQ. I got an iced cold brew with cream and sweetened. Justin got the Iced Vanilla Latte that was mentioned on Yelp and for once his coffee was better than mine. I would definitely recommend trying it. The baristas were also really nice and fun.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Some really great things:  SOFAS! Three of them. For someone who puts sofa seating as the number one on my coffee shop must-haves, this was a great find.  Delicious lavender soy latte made my day. A unique, sweet, light flavor that I probably could have had several of.  Funky decor, witty signs and Austin art. All awesome.  Only downside..... it has a bit of a funky smell. It was worth adjusting to, but was a concern initially.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Stopped here after lunch as we were walking around and wanted a drink in hand during our stroll. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I'm probably not the most qualified person to review a coffee shop but I am a big fan of iced tea. The interior is relatively small but there are an assortment of sofas and chairs if you are trying to get some work done/study. I got the lavender lemonade which was really good, nice creativity there with the mix of lemonade and lavender.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins This place is literally so cute. I only got coffee to go this time but I'll definitely come back and study here. Parking is a little limited in the lot but there's a pay to park on the street. You only need to pay tues-Saturday 6pm-12 am. Internet password is ilovepuppies  This place offers coffee and little treats. They make their own syrups so it's super delicious and blends well into the coffee rather than stick at the bottom like Starbucks. I got a vanilla latte and my BF got the lavender latte. Both were delicious! It was a good amount of sweet. I'm not a huge fan of lavender but I actually enjoyed it! It has a really nice fragrant taste and not too overpowering.  This is probably going to become one of my go tos. I'm pretty obsessed with the decor in here: cute paintings, succulents, lights....basically tumblr hipster lol. Vanilla latte",1
Coffee Shop 76,2 check-ins One of my favorite places to come and study! Its a bigger coffeshop than most and I really liked their tea and how they put everything in mason jars. The staff wasnt that friendly though... And they dont really have any food so i givie it 4 stars. However the interior design is really cute and its a good place to go study.,1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee This place is quiet! I mean shhh quiet making it the perfect place to get some work done. The background music is barely noticeable, there are ample electrical plugs throughout the coffee shop and it is comfortable.  I had 30 minutes to spare on the east side nearby Vintage Coffee and decided to cozy up with a cold brew and a Topo Chico. Service was friendly and I was happy with their selection of caffeine and variety of mineral waters. I haven't been drinking coffee for about 15 months so I was timid about going for the cold brew. The barista on duty shared that it is pretty mild and it is as blend a couple different coffees. I also opted for a Topo Chico. The cold brew was on the mild side and was served up in a mason jar. I found a comfortable couch and enjoyed my caffeinated beverage.  Tips: The wifi password is ilovepuppies, now how cute is that! There are food trailers next door if you are hungry and want a change of scenery. Topo and cold brew",1
Coffee Shop 76,"A 6 people lounge bar splaid through the middle concave of this modern day coffee tavern sets a mood of rustic and yet alive. The barista accommodated my off menu tea latte with almond milk and got it frothy, a tricky thing to do. The trickster was even in a band and I played his song through my phone waves. Really epic, check out brand new stew on youtube. If you're looking for old Austin vibes come drink here.  Teas are organic and human friendlified.",1
Coffee Shop 76,Really sweet coffee shop on the east side. I expected something super hipster but it was actually just calm and simple. They make a solid cappuccino and there are tables outside so you can sit and observe a typical East 7th morning.  Bonus points for going green with cloth napkins!,1
Coffee Shop 76,"Really dug this place. Chill vibe, tasty espresso, nice staff, scrabble, and free wifi. Need one ask for more in a coffee shop? Plus they have a small parking lot and are adjacent to the Boteco food truck. Definitely in my coffee shop stable now.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"I was not impressed. First of all, parking was a huge hassle and that sets the tone for anything that comes after. The AC was also broken so it was extremely hot indoors. All of the chairs are itty bitty and made out of cheap wood, so I felt like I was about to fall out of my chair the entire time. I ordered the orange creamsicle drink, and they literally just mixed orange soda with milk.",0
Coffee Shop 76,"Alright here's the low down, I'm a sucker for drinks in a mason jar.  As soon as I see Yelp pictures of this, I'm there.  I'm not sure why, I've pondered it for quite some time, maybe I need to ask a therapist.  Anyhow, that's what led me here on a Sunday afternoon.  If you are entering from 7th street the parking can be pretty tight.  I think there are only about 2 spaces on the 7th street side of the store.  There is a back alley behind the store where there are a few more spots back there.  There is also a rear entrance to the store you can go through if you park in the back.  Once inside it has the feel of being in a small house which is pretty cool.  There is a good amount of seating divided into 2 rooms with a huge bar area with stools on both sides.  Great area for working with laptops. Now on to the drinks.  We got a cold brew and a iced chai latte.  I had to get cold drinks because again, I'm here for the mason jars.  The iced chai was very refreshing.  It tasted as a chai latte should with just the right amount of spice. The cold brew was bold and had good flavor.  No lingering after taste and just what I needed to energize me for the rest of the day. There are so many awesome coffee shops opening up all around town.  I would definitely add this one to my list of ones to try if you haven't been here.  Very cool atmosphere to hang out with a few friends, read a book, do some work on a laptop, or just chill on a couch.

Coffee Shop 76,"I was looking for a not too busy, not too loud coffee shop recently that would be convenient to two of us coming from downtown and one coming from Northeast Austin. Harder to find than you would think... A friend mentioned she thought Vintage Heart was not too loud and I might like it.  Done!  Made that appointment and showed up early to scope the place out. There were a few people scattered here and there at 1pm midweek, but it really made me happy that the music was not obtrusive and I could find a place to park.  The counter staff were very pleasant and helpful, and I put in my order for a Cinnamon Latte after perusing all of the options. (Um, did I mention they have baked goods from Russell's Bakery? - Thankfully not the carrot or Italian cream cake, because those are my diet kryptonite!)  My latte came out and was really beautifully done. I have to admit my first thought was,""I bet this is going to have that fruity after taste I often notice in high end lattes.""  Nope. It was exquisite. Dark but not burnt, no fruity tones and no bitter aftertaste. Amazing coffee flavor!  I thought it might be just mine, but my friends who ordered two other flavors of lattes had the same experience. They both said, ""This is the best latte I have had in Austin.""  Nice job, Vintage Heart! I will be back and will bring more friends.  Note: I would have happily shared this review on Facebook, but for some reason it kept picking up your sign in the women's bathroom as the image, and that is NOT something I want to post. Just a heads up.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Nice hipster coffee joint on 6th street with plenty of outlets and easy wifi access, making it a nice spot to sit down and get some work done while you sip your coffee. All syrups are made in house and the pastry selection includes some gluten free options. Had a nice vanilla/cinnamon latte, apricot scone, and a stuffed croissant (spinach and mozzarella), all of which were very good.  Bus your own tables. Cloth napkins for sustainability. All nice touches.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Totally the Austin vibe we were searching for. The art in the back parking lot was kickass and beautiful, and the drinks inside didn't disappoint. Bae remarked that this was ""hands down the best vanilla latte I've had."" I had a Violet Femme iced tea (lavender earl grey) that was super.  The reason it gets five stars: our barista was super friendly and accommodating. She asked us - yes asked us - if we needed the wifi password. And I nearly passed out with cuteness overload when she gave it to us (that's a secret that you'll have to stop by to experience). She also gave us a ton of places to check out for brunch and hanging; they were spot on and totally our pace and level of weirdness.  All in all, this place was cool and delicious without being pretentious.",1
Coffee Shop 76,2 check-ins Second attempt at the place due to its excellent Yelp rating but can't get past the ammonia smell and stark/clinical atmosphere to order anything. Limited vehicle parking; best accessed by foot or bicycle.,0
Coffee Shop 76,"Okay... So listen, I wanted to like this place. Truly, I did. I have friends from Austin who just love this cute little shop, but for me it was a total miss. As soon as we walked in the smell of cats just overtook us. Now, I don't have a problem with cats, but when I'm going to have to sit on their ratted up couch or torn up chair, I don't want to have to also picture 20 cats around me.  The latter was good, $4 for a small cup. And free wifi is a plus as well. Will I be back? Probably not, but like I said earlier, some of my friends really love this place.",0
Coffee Shop 76,The coffee shop itself is cute and clean.  The lavender latte is definitely worth trying at least once.  It's lightly sweet and distinctly floral.  The only drawback to this place is that there's usually only one person working behind the counter so things can be kind of slow going if there's a line.,1
Coffee Shop 76,"Listed in 2016 Yelp 100 Challenge, Austin It's a cute little place along 7th street. It seems like it used to be someone's home. There are couple of parking spots in front, otherwise you would have to park around the back. Decor is very cute, hip but comfy.  Anyways, for drinks - we got a cortado and a cold brew. Cold brew was good no hints of bitterness while the cortado was nice and rounded.  There are few pods next door and some tables and benches which are especially nice during sunny days. We opted to seat outside out front while remaining under the shaded area.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Snapshot: 4.4/5 Coffee Flavor 5/5 Atmosphere, 4/5 Location/Parking  Great vibe that's offers wifi, music and plenty of seating. The decor is neutral with an industrial modern approach.  Vintage offers home made syrups (my gf enjoyed the lavender) and I say try them all.  The coffee is roasted to near perfection.  Worth checking out as the service is great",1
Coffee Shop 76,Seriously just meh. Coffee Meh. Atmosphere even more meh and looked like it just opened. Snack/pastry selection...meh. Customer service meh.. Looked like a great place to study though!,0
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins Super cute place, and my only critique is that there is not enough parking. I came here on a Sunday so thankfully street parking was free. Idk if I would've bothered to stay and pay for parking on any other day of the week.  There could also be more seats...  I ordered an iced caramel latte, but they don't have caramel. This ended up being totally fine because they have other things like vanilla, lavender, chai, mocha, and cinnamon.  I ended up getting an iced vanilla cinnamon latte and oh my gosh so so good. Fast and friendly service also is a plus.  A lot of natural lighting and good noise level. It can be quiet at times and slightly noisy at other times. I like to be in coffeeshops that aren't too quiet or loud so this place was the perfect in between.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Listed in Hello Yelp 100 - it's 2016, My Fix, Second Home Vintage Heart is just so stinking cute. It's smaller than most coffee shops I've been to, and the mood lighting just makes it so cozy - with the exception that the chairs here are not particularly comfortable, save for the sofas placed around the shop.  I ordered a vanilla latte on the recommendation of the baristas (who are so friendly, by the way), and it had just the right amount of sweetness and a luscious foam topping that made the drink go down so smoothly. Plus, all of their syrups are made in house - I could definitely taste the difference between fresh vanilla and vanilla flavoring.  Overall a super cute spot to come and get work done. Free wifi, too (the barista very cutely exclaimed ""it's 'ilovepuppies!'"")!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Classic coffee combos, great prices that include tax. The espresso wasn't as strong as I hoped, but for the price, and the chill atmosphere I will frequent more often. The decor is simplistic, and tons of space to do some studying. The girl behind the counter was very sweet and was mindful enough to explain that their macchiato is nothing like Starbucks; don't expect an overly sugarfied confection here haha. I'm really interested in trying their teas next time I stop in. Cool artwork right outside their store front",1
Coffee Shop 76,I really enjoyed my vanilla latte and also enjoyed the atmosphere. The barista behind the counters was very friendly and helpful. The only thing was the parking situation was not ideal but typical Austin. I will be going back soon.,1
Coffee Shop 76,"Love this place even though parking is a pain in the...  I feel like I had to drive through some hood alley in order to park over some slanted and not very leveled rock supported road.  Love the little artwork outside too.  Staff were nice and friendly.  Coffee was on point, but not out of this world.    Good place to just sit down for some peace and quiet or to study.  I wouldn't come here again just for the coffee, but I would for the chill factor and as a good place to get some work done.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Cute little quaint place in Austin. The menu selection is small with only a few coffees, teas, and lemonade. I really wanted a hazelnut coffee but opted for an iced vanilla latte. Pretty darn good! They offer a small variety of snacks which I did not try. If I ever have time in the morning I can probably make my way to VHC. Not bad!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"16 check-ins This is one of my favorite coffee shops. They've always had the friendly baristas. It's small enough to be cozy, but big enough to find seating. Lighting seems low enough to feel comfortable, but not dark enough to wear you couldn't read a book. I had the privilege of meeting the owner shortly after they opened, and knowing who is behind the business makes me want to support it even more. My favorite drink here is a hot americano. They use excellent espresso and always make an excellent drink!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"One of my favorite coffee shops in town. I like to bring people here because this place is unique and unlike any other. The decor is fresh and quirky and the establishment is VERY clean. Parking is a little difficult but if the lot is full you can park on a side street to walk there. My favorite drink is the iced vanilla latte with lavender. I would never think to put lavender in my drink but it's SO delightful. I highly recommend! It's a good spot to chill and relax. Also, the staff is super friendly and nice. Keep it up, baristas! :)",1
Coffee Shop 76,Cute little coffee shop on the east side one of my favorite places to get my morning vanilla lavender latte :) The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that during the summer months it gets really hot inside. Which makes it not very enjoyable for people trying to relax and study. Besides that I love the environment and the coffee is top notch!,1
Coffee Shop 76,"I work at the food truck next door and Vintage Heart's coffee and cold brew is the fuel that keeps me running. Dark, strong, fresh coffee! Only suggestion is to upgrade AC system as it does get stuffy inside when its a full house.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"3 check-ins I am a picky person when it comes to coffee. I rarely drink it due to my heightened sense of taste and smell. The burnt beans and acidic flavor can sometimes be overwhelming at certain places. Vintage Heart Coffee is one of the very few places where I love to go and actually get myself a cup of coffee. Their lavender latte is UH-MAY-ZING. I really liked it with the almond milk, too. It has this subtle scent of lavender and toasted marshmallow. The ambience is so cute and cozy, yet very artsy and trendy! Their service is really great and the location is great if you are in central Austin. If I had the money and lived closer, I would come here every day! The building is covered in art on the outside, too. There is not much parking available but many people walk or ride their bicycles here so I have never had trouble actually finding parking. I bring my sister here every time she is in town from Dallas along with all of my close friends who are coffee lovers. I wish they would open a location up north but until then I will make my drive down to this location every time I crave the lavender latte. I'm thankful that such a delightful drink exists in Austin!! hehe",1
Coffee Shop 76,"We went to many places in Austin within 2 days and Vintage Heart is absolutely my favorite local coffee shop. I love the location, the decor and of course, the drinks. It was so cozy and very friendly, a suitable place to sit and talk for hours with  whoever you're with or just meet that day. I ordered the Lavender latte and although I loved it, I had to say the Vanilla latte my friend had was so much better. The outside was pretty spacey at well;  if the weather allowed I would have totally hung out at the porch. The colored wall is a nice touch, we took a few pictures using it as a background.

Coffee Shop 76,"26 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials The Location: Looks like your average Austin hipster coffee joint- next to a couple food trucks, graffiti art, small lot in the back for parking. Might seem like an awkward spot to find at first. As for the inside, I love the atmosphere - chic, modern and comfortable with plenty of seating and sophisticated decor.  The Drinks: So far, I have tried the vanilla latte, cortado, and lavender latte. Everything I've had is honestly very good; I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. Mocha soy latte was good but vanilla was better, and iced soy latte was really light and refreshing. Their hot lattes are light, smooth, and not too sweet. I highly recommend the lavender latte. Once you get it, nothing else will compare, anywhere.  The Service: Generally slow; when I go, there is usually one person working for a long line, but they are very friendly and efficient and definitely know what they're doing. Worth any wait!  Overall: Definitely my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. Great atmosphere, great coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill This is one of my favorite, favorite study spots in Austin. I'm super particular about study environments, and very few would garner a 4-5 star rating from me.  Vintage Heart is warm and comfortable, with bright, natural lighting and fairy lights. It's not open very late (and probably not too brightly-lit in the evenings anyway), so it's definitely a perfect place to go for those early morning and afternoon study grinds or catch-ups. Although the venue itself is relatively small, Vintage Heart has living-room style couches, a bar, plenty of small and medium-sized tables, and a larger high table with lots of working space. Since it's slightly further from campus, it's also typically not TOO busy! Good, calm music, too, and the perfect amount of background noise. Wifi is also free and reliable!  The lavender latte tastes amazing and is super aromatic, and the vanilla mocha is chocolatey and delicious. The heart design on the foam is a nice touch.  One of my favorite things about Vintage Heart, too, is their attention to the environment and unnecessary waste - they use glass cups and mason jars for both their hot and cold drinks and use pieces of washable, patterned cloth as their napkins. Love it.  The downsides: parking is super difficult with such few lots - it could fit about seven cars in total. Also, during the peak times in the afternoon, snagging a comfortable study spot can sometimes be difficult and since there is normally only one employee making the drinks, there may be a little bit of wait. lavender latte",1
Coffee Shop 76,"4 check-ins Vintage heart took my heart for three reasons 1. The place is stunning inside. Think modern with a vintage feel that is nice and bright. 2. Available parking: While there are only maybe 6 spots in total, it's still is something and I was able to find parking quickly during my visit. 3. The staff: they go beyond expectations and make great coffee 4.Simple menu, it's not at all a overwhelming amount of choices and they have a variety of pastries to choose from!  On a rainy summer day, where the walls were leaking and people were fast to work, I had to make the hard choice between Vintage Heart and the nearby Figure 8. I was happy with my choice as  the coffee was great, I love the fact they have homemade syrups and the brownie was killer. Regardless of the atmosphere, it's a bit too quiet and small for a gathering of friends but i will surely be back!",1

I love the ambience in this place. It's very conducive to studying and the baristas are so nice.  I would highly recommend the lavender latte or vanilla latte. You will NOT be disappointed! The cortado is also really good!  The only downside is that parking can be tricky here. There's a very small parking lot. I believe there are three spots in the front and a few more in the back.

Coffee Shop 76,"6 check-ins Vintage Heart is one of my staple places to go. It's never packed but often has a lively energy with people chatting, working, or reading.  The baristas are kind and welcoming. They serve their coffee in cute glassware. And they are one of the only coffee shops in Austin that saves on wasting napkins by providing pretty cloth handkerchiefs for your use.  Live on the east side? Want some good coffee and a peaceful spot to meet a friend? Come and give Vintage Heart a sip.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Internet was pretty fast, my vanilla latte was really good. The syrups are homemade which made the experience even better!

Very cute, I would highly recommend. Latte and cold brew!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Updated review 16 check-ins Updating only to say that Monica and Courtney are the sweetest baristas around!  They both know my ""usual!""  Such a great neighborhood spot!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"The first day I tried this place out I went up to order some tea, Barrista was not rude, but not really friendly (close to unfriendly actually). Plops a teabag in a cup of hot water and shoves it over. My eyes narrow to slits, because wtf ... (usually there'll be a pot of brewed tea for you or they'll actually take the time to let the tea sit before bringing it to you), but I kiss my teeth, leave a decent tip then go back to have my ""tea"" (had to actually go back to get milk separately ... which is another irritation)  I go back to order the same thing a few hours later (was at the shop all afternoon). And this time, post-tip, I get quicker service, a pot of brewed tea, a mug with brewed tea poured in, and a special milk container with freshly poured milk ... nary a teabag in sight.  Side. Eye.  So yeah ... I liked this place and will be going back but that whole chain of events kinda got on my nerves. Maybe its because ... you know ... I'm black, and she thought I wouldn't tip (it happens), or maybe she was just having a bad morning, either way ... poor form.  I'm sure they can do better though, it is a nice Austin coffeeshop and I'm very pro-Austin-coffeshop so go support this place, because its actually a pretty cute, well laid out, clean with fast wifi (sideye @ Patika ... grrr), parking can be a bit of an issue though.  Enjoy.  PS: Will amend to 4 stars when I've gone back a couple of times to make sure poor/erratic service isn't a recurring theme here.  PS2: went back ... service was great. I like.  PS3: The wifi here is amazing ... I hang out at coffeeshops all day ... trust me on this.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"I wanted to go to Vintage Heart because they brew Third Coast coffee, which is my favorite in town. I was not at all disappointed.  Beautiful, modern farmhouse decor -- white walls mixed with wooden furniture. Between couches, tables, and bar stools, there are a variety of seating arrangements. There were only a few people at 10 am, which gave a nice quiet ambiance.  Barista was friendly and welcoming. The cortado she served me was amazing, and I enjoyed a donut from Red Rabbit Cooperative.  There are many places to get coffee on the East side, but this should really be your first choice. Cortado and the decor.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Great coffee, nice atmosphere, and Mike is an awesome barista! They also make their own syrups- I highly recommend their iced lavender latte.",1
Coffee Shop 76,This is my go to coffee shop. I stop here at least 5 times a week before heading into work. Super friendly staff and great coffee.  The aroma of coffee permeates throughout the building and the smell alone is enough to help wake me up and get my day going.,1
Coffee Shop 76,"This place is soooo rockin! The staff are always friendly and setting makes it very comfortable to work, sip, or simply breathe in peace. The selection of gluten free treats are pretty spectacular, making it even more of a joy to be there.  Def check this place out! Tis the season for tea :-)",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Really cute, very quiet... almost too quiet.  Reasonable prices and a damn good latte.  Parking is limited but during the day it is easy to find street parking.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Take a break from starbucks and try a more intimate setting.  Open space, simple, peaceful atmosphere with free wifi.  I tried the iced chai. It was more on the sweet, milky side and lacked the spice I'm used to with chai, but I still enjoyed it.  If you need to get some work done in a quiet place, I'd recommend this place if you're near UT. Nice open space",1
Coffee Shop 76,"5 check-ins This place is so cute!  Given that this is finals season for UT students, I expected to have issues finding a seat or parking, but I really didn't, which was a nice surprise. Given, I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact, it was pretty empty, which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends, it seems to be super packed.  There's a lot of natural light, and the color scheme is easy on the eyes, and the decor is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha  The environment is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal chairs and tables, the wifi is free and fast (and has an adorable password!), outlets are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some spots), the music is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of people who come--middle aged people getting some work done, yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine, college students studying, etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole environment is pretty chill but for some reason, everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again, maybe I just came at a good time.  A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute, printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy.  In terms of the beverages, the first time I came, I got a hot vanilla latte, and this time I got an iced vanilla latte. I also tried my friend's iced americano, too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The lattes didn't have notes of a super dark, rich espresso, which I'm personally ok with. Slightly too sweet, but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. Prices are on par with other places in Austin.  The baristas are also very friendly, patient and seem like normal humans.  Overall, this is one of my favorite coffee spots in Austin! I personally love the vibe and the beverages. The only cons are the small-ish parking lot and the slightly dirty bathroom, but the decor of it is cute for what they had to work with haha.  10/10 would come again. and again. and again.",1
Coffee Shop 76,I found this unique coffee shop close to my house.  I got the iced vanilla latte with a turkey cheese croissant.  Perfect & on point.  Both workers super friendly & helpful. Free WiFi is a plus.  I will be back!,1
Coffee Shop 76,"The name says it all.  I ordered a chai tea latte. Yes, I made sure to check with the barista that the latte was not simply a ""chai tea"" powder with milk. They make it from scratch and it really shows.  The quality of product was matched by the friendliness of the barista. She was helpful and warm.  And of course, the place was quite cozy. lovely wooden tables and counter tops. The floor and couches in the back could use a touch up.  Overall, sweet.",1
Coffee Shop 76,Smooth delicious cold brew. So good. Did I mention smooth? Like without cream and sugar or syrup it was so smooth. wholehearted 5 stars just on that!,1
Coffee Shop 76,"Cute little placed hidden away in plain sight on E 7th (the sign isn't hanging, so you'll need to look for the address). We stopped in during a Saturday morning walk and were pleasantly surprised with the friendly service, calming atmosphere, and the quality of our latte, cold brew, and cinnamon roll. Will definitely add this to our list of east side favorites! Delicious! And apparently they carry bagels from Rockstar too! Next time ;)",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Beautiful place, nice vibes and super nice people working. I swear on my life I love this place! So artsy and vibey I love this so much the jars are super cute Moms cold brew See all photos from Diana D. for Vintage Heart Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Sometimes I feel like I give out 5 stars a little too. Easily. But what can I say, when there's and amazing cold brew coffee, and that's all you order. Well. 5 stars.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Was visiting Austin for SXSW and luckily discovered this place. I've never felt more welcome and comfortable away from home. The music isn't too loud and isn't the top 40 hit garbage often heard in coffee shops. (Alabama Shakes was playing during my last visit.) The customer service exceeded my expectations which is rare. These aren't the average millennial baristas who seem to hate themselves and their jobs. These baristas seem genuinely happy and devoted to making sure you get what you need. Places like this are bittersweet because it makes me painfully aware that there aren't any coffee shops as good as this one where I'm from.  Oh, and the wifi is fast, too! About 6 megs down if you're the only one using it.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"This is my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. Really. Clean, quaint, cute, and great service. The lavender latte was wonderful. I wish there were a location further north--I'd go every day!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Hmm, I'm kind of split on 3 or 4 stars here. Why 3 stars: the coffee was just okay. I went with yelp recommendations and ordered the iced vanilla latte. Super cute in the mason jar, but honestly kinda just tasted like Starbucks? Not necessarily a bad thing, but considering they make the vanilla syrup in house here it's just kinda disappointing. Makes me feel like I shoulda gotten espresso. Will update this review if I return!  Why 4 stars: this spot is really cute, with warm lighting and lots of seating. It's a great place to get work done (they have outlets!) or just meet up with friends.  Cool street art outside also.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Great coffee, convenient location and the most friendly Baristas. I've been coming here for two years and it's my favorite coffee shop in Austin. The owner Mallory always looks for feedback and really cares about the customers. If you work remote, this is a great place to do so.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Darn good espresso , had the Cortado and it was exactly as it was supposed to be, delicious.  Staff is stellar, can't say enough good things about this place. Highly recommend, big thumbs up!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Small, minimally decorated location with a rough parking situation. The service is efficient and friendly. Must try the lavender latte! I got mine iced, and it was perfect for a really hot afternoon.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Great drinks in a nice space.  Music is light so it's easy to get some work done or converse with friends.  If only the pastries were better.  Twice now I have had the brownie and it is clearly from a box :(  I just assume if they are slacking on one pastry, they are slacking on them all.  Will come here for coffee and work though :)  Just not if I'm hungry.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"I dont really hang out much at coffee houses, came here because i was in the area, and had some work i had to get done.  The place has nice decor, very modern and clean. Its a little small, so working space was pretty limited.  I had the vanilla latte, it was good, the beans seemed to good quality, nice and fragrant.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins I came here last week, so this review is a little late. That being said, I still think about this place, a lot. I loved it when I walked in. The environment/interior was warm and inviting, the barista was incredibly friendly and adorable. I loved his upbeat attitude. I ordered an ice mocha and my friend ordered an iced latte. The coffee was great, kind of the perfect mix (at least for me).  I can definitely see this easily becoming one of my favorite coffee places in Austin. Maybe I'm bias because this was the first coffee shop I came to in Austin? I also adored that the coffee was served in mason jars.",1
Coffee Shop 76,This is such a cute little coffee shop that I was surprised when I didn't see more people there! I came in on a Sunday morning and was one of only a couple people there. Good coffee for a decent price and some baked goods if you want. I came here after a bike ride and stumbled upon this shop on the East side. The décor is great and just feels like somewhere you'd want to hang out at. I'm sure if I brought my laptop I would've stayed much longer. There service was good and friendly and would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a casual spot in the area. Sitting outside with a cup of joe!,1
Coffee Shop 76,I am an expert on all things coffee and I say vintage heart is the closest thing to the perfect latte/cappuccino I've ever tasted!! If I had any suggestion it would be LAVENDER LATTE!!!! The espresso is naturally smooth and not bitter and the lavender gives it an herbal sweetness with no bitter aftertaste! It is just great. And so cute. And the latte art is grand. Lavender Latte perfection It's so cute in here. My best advice? GET A LAVENDER LATTE!!! it'll change your life.,1
Coffee Shop 76,"23 check-ins So I'm not a coffee guy. Never was interested and yada yada. Until one day this girl (now gf) comes into my life explaining how amazing coffee is and etc. I decided, Yelp show me a good coffee place to bring her to and one for me to try and enjoy. I wasn't disappointed.  Vintage coffee is located in an awkward spot, and it looks normal and all until you open that front door and BAM! You suddenly are inside of this well kept modern scenic coffee shop! Really the decor is partially why I love this place.  I wish I could explain more about coffee but sorry, I know nothing except that I enjoy my soy vanilla latte which is light on the flavor but just enough to give me that sweet taste! My girlfriend absolutely adores this location and points out that their coffee is pretty good so do yourself a favor and come check this place out!  P.S. The location is fantastic for pictures Lattes with some cute designs",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Cute, comfy place for a iced tea or coffee. Free wifi and friendly service. Can't go wrong for a place to cool off during the summer.",1
Coffee Shop 76,Being a cold brew snob myself I can say that the Cold Brew is a definite clear winner!!!,1
Coffee Shop 76,"I'm a sucker for cute little coffee shops and Austin definitely has a wide variety of them. Vintage Heart has to be one of my favorites!  First, the iced coffee is served in cute little mason jars. The iced vanilla latte is my preferred drink, and it's the perfect combo of sweet and creamy. Even on chillier days, I love to drink it. The interior is comfy and cozy, with a mixture of small tables, couches, and bar seating. I especially love the light fixtures!  The service is super friendly and the inside/bathrooms are clean, too!  The only downside I would have to add is that parking can be difficult (but when is it not in Austin...) and there aren't a ton of places to sit and study, especially if it's a busy day. There are a couple of tables outside, though, if you don't mind sitting outside. Either way, I love coming here to drink some good coffee and escape the school scene for a bit. Iced vanilla latte, perfect balance of sweet and creamy!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"Vintage Heart is a cozy, quiet little coffee shop with a WiFi hotspot where the syrups are all housemade. I ordered a mocha from the friendly barista and it did not disappoint. I didn't order any, but the pastries looked tasty. If you're looking for a chill shop to relax in or do some studying for school, this is your shop.",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins Found this little coffee shop on Yelp, and boy was I NOT disappointed. It was incredibly quiet when my friend and I walked in, with customers reading or on their laptops. It was exactly the atmosphere I'm obsessed with. The lady working did seem a bit stern and not as inviting, but that doesn't take away from the great mood, atmosphere, and amazing soy vanilla latte I had. The latte was incredibly creamy and delicious, I wish I had taken one to go. Soy vanilla latte",1
Coffee Shop 76,"2 check-ins Head over to this nice, house-turned-cafe for THE BEST LATTE YOU HAVE EVER HAD! It's not too crowded or noisy, and the two ladies at the front are really nice! They only have one coffee cup size, which is similar to the Grande cups at Starbucks. For the first time in my life, I would actually buy a larger serving of coffee if they sell it! I had the Latte and my girlfriend had the Mocha, and both were equally good. The location seems very homely, and unlike other famous/commercialized/both cafes, this place has a very welcoming feel to it. I was never a fan of Starbucks, which in my opinion, is not even worth being labeled coffee, and after going here, I hate Starbucks even more. I will be spending time looking for places like that in Houston! A Latte and a Mocha!",1
Coffee Shop 76,"I have lived near this place for several months but only got around to trying it recently after a brunch at Hightower (a restaurant whose only brunch downside is their average coffee). From the outside, Vintage Heart looks a little run down and not very impressive. However, inside its a very impressive and well-run coffee shop. I usually get their full French press and share it with someone else, but all of their coffee options are delicious. Like most good coffee shops, their baristas are always very knowledgable and it is a comfortable, relaxing place to hang out for awhile. There's a lot of good options on the east side, and this is definitely on that list.",1
Coffee Shop 76,I must say that they have one of the best vanilla lattes in the area! Whenever I'm in Austin I make sure to stop here and get one! It's one of the best that I have had hear in Austin! Highly recommend!,1
Coffee Shop 76,"Great iced latte: sweet but flavorful and not dilute at all. Their macchiato was a little bitterer than I expected, though. Still a really nice place to hang out and they have great choice in coffee, too.",1
Coffee Shop 76,Listed in Coffee Houses I got a mix and ordered the cinnamon and vanilla latte and he got a cold brew. It was delicious and frothy. There's a great seating area for chatting and tables for people to study. There's some parking and the ladies behind the bar were really nice. We go here when we visit our friends in Austin and we grab coffee for the drive back. Our friends say it's their favorite coffee shop in the whole city so we always stop by. Cute coffee shop,1
Coffee Shop 24,"4 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost I hella love this place.  Patrick and Lorenzo are great. You can tell that they love coffee because of the great selection of beans and innovative drinks - they recently won Austin Chronicle's 'Coffee Innovation' award! They are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly too. I feel like each time I come, I'm picking their brains about brewing coffee at home. One time, Patrick gave me some grounds to compare for home and pellets to clean out my coffee grinder. Friendly, passionate, and knowledgable folks.  The drinks taste great, and the morning ritual is a nice 'treatyoself.'  I get excited each time I come to Fleet! Look forward to coming back again and again.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Listed in ATX Coffee Fix A new coffeeshop to add to my list here in Austin. Although particularly small inside, there is ample room outside near the front. In addition to the standard coffee drinks, they have some fun ones like the Saturday Morning Ritual. I would not recommend this drink for those who don't like their coffee sweet. The time I stopped by, they used fruity pebble infused-milk for the specialty drink and hear they may be changing it up again. My recommendation to Fleet is to use Froot Loops instead--anyone with me?  The only negatives I can think of is their drinks being overly expensive--the specialty drinks are easily over 6 dollars. In addition, I had a hard time accessing their main wifi but luckily they do have a back-up so do not be afraid to ask. I spent half an hour thinking my laptop had the issue but apparently other customers also have had that experience.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"I liked this coffee shop a lot! It is a small place, but very comfortable. The barista is a excellent coffee maker and any kind of coffee you choose will be delicious. I prefer Latte without sugar and to follow a simple croissant. And so begins my day.  The place is close ACC Eastview, so you can visit after or before the class with friends. A Latte and a croissant",1
Coffee Shop 24,"4.5. The owners of Fleet Coffee are some of the best Baristas in town and their coffee shop is representative of their attention to detail and artistic abilities.  I'm always fascinated with the accentuated taste of a latte or Capuccino when there is artwork! Granted it is harder to take the first sip, because you won't want to mess up the latte art.  Fleet uses extremely high quality coffee beans to make their concoctions. Speaking of concoctions, they have several creations with ingredients you wouldn't typically think of combining.  They all mix well together and you'll start to stray from your usual cup of joe.  Grab a Saturday Morning Ritual infused with fruity pebble milk! They'll even put a homemade fruity pebble treat on the plate. They make them in-house (I've seen these bad boys coming out of the oven and being cut up for serving).  If you like your espresso with a bit of a citrus kick, indulge in the E.T.  It's brilliant.  If you just want a Capuccino, that's fine too. They're exquisite.  Check out their beautifully designed and built patio furnished with wood-crafted tables and chairs.  They have wifi too, if you need a spot to connect.  You'll love this place like I do. I hope. E.T. On the left and iced latte on the right. Cutest pillows in the shop. Capuccino",1
Coffee Shop 24,"This adorbs coffee spot was a nice change than going to my usual. They had unique options in addition to the usual coffee and latte most places have. They serve cocktail style beverages that are really fun (served with coffee, no alcohol). Don't let the location scare you. It's up and coming, although at one point I had the ""where AM I?"" moment. My only complaint was that the place was rather small without much seating. After ten minutes of sitting inside I was feeling claustrophobic as the customers came in waves so I Ieft. Overall, cute spot. I'll be back! Saturday Morning Ritual mocktail. It was So good! coffee menu",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Fleet is great and definitely worth a stop (in addition to return visits). They take their coffee and tea seriously and you can tell. They churn out some tasty stuff with a unique spin here and there. For example, you really can taste the doughnut in their doughnut infused milk.  They have ample seating outside with narrow seating inside; if you've been here, you know what I mean. It works well. I hung out here for a while sipping my espresso and having some good conversation.  Patrick and Lorenzo are great themselves and have a really good thing going that I think many will appreciate. I look forward to return visits. Morning Ritual",1
Coffee Shop 24,"My new favorite coffee shop in Austin! (And that's saying something)  The interior is a bit small, and there's not a lot of seating, but it's cozy if you can find a seat. However, they have a larger outdoor patio, so when the weather is nicer, that'll be my go-to spot. I had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Patrick, and he's super nice and funny - it's nice to have a barista who chats with you and isn't stuck up! Their coffee is great and it comes in these bright blue cups that is aesthetically pleasing to me (#instaworthy). I will definitely come back to get a quick study sesh or to catch up with friends!  Great customer service + great coffee + great space = 5 stars for me! Latte in bright blue cups! Interior feat. barista/owner Patrick",1
Coffee Shop 24,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Fleet and Flitch are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you care? Trust Lorenzo's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Fleet stops doing that around 3pm. I did think my $3.75 Madcap Spring Fling pour-over was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of interior design, it's easy to park, and this area of Webberville street sure is pretty interesting - hey, isn't that Gourmands & the new Dog & Duck Pub? Fleet takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. 8 people can sit inside, it's a pretty clever design. Lots of outside space. That's my cup, btw.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Coffee is excellent but very fully priced. Inside is tiny and seating is pretty uncomfortable. The interior is beautifully detailed and nice to look at. HOWEVER, every time I sit down inside to drink my coffee, I leave smelling like a stale ashtray. I think this is because the place is tiny and cigarette stink blows in the door from their front porch. Bottom line, I will grab a cup to go but not hang out for an extended period of time.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Wonderful coffee shop! I went several weeks ago with a friend and all our kids. It was fairly straightforward to find, with parking in front. There are several picnic tables outside, which is always nice to find on a sunny, spring day in Austin! There is also lots of space outside that has the potential for either more tables or other things.  Inside, the shop is immaculately clean and simple. They designed the indoor space well considering the building itself is in a bit of a V shape. I know the shop is owned by two guys, one of whom I'm not familiar with, but Patrick I remember from Caffe Medici. I'm happy for the launch of his business, since I remember him being an exceptionally good barista at Medici.  They have a very creative menu. I wish I could remember off the top of my head some of the unique items they had, but on the day we came in we just kept it simple. I had a cafe au lait  with almond milk, which was excellent.  Service was great and very welcoming. Even the bathroom was clean, which is always appreciated when you go places with kids.  Hours are also easy to remember - 7 AM to 7 PM!  Definitely check out this place! Menu",1
Coffee Shop 24,"I love this place. I'm a bit of a coffee aficionado and I know a good coffee shop when I visit one; this is the real deal. Just recently opened and running like a dream. The two owners are the sole baristas at this joint, and that seems to work because they are seemingly good friends (to customers and each other). Funnily enough, in talking to one of the baristas, we found that we had a few common friends from the KCMO coffee scene!! The coffee world is small[ish].  The indoor space at Fleet is tight, but I think it works to encourage people to spend some time outdoors or get friendly with their neighbors. The inside is a smallish trapezoid with a low bench online wall and a high bar at another (along the window). Outside, they have several picnic tables and who doesn't love some good ol' vitamin D?  They have the essential coffee items that one expects, but they also have some interesting drinks they've conjured up for the adventurous coffee drinker. A donut-infused milk drink, a root beer coffee beverage, and a delightfully crisp drink which I this is best described as a coffee version of a gin&tonic (obviously, minus the tonic). I tried the latter one on my second visit there, and it was AWESOME.  First time I visited, I asked for an iced pour over, and they said they could do that, but their iced coffee was actually brewed as a pour over and was ready à l'instant...so yeah, I went with that. It was some of the best iced coffee I've ever had.  I anticipate being rather regular at this coffee shop. Cheers!! I forget what this is called",1
Coffee Shop 24,"2 check-ins Though slightly hidden in East Austin, Fleet has a quaint but inviting exterior. Inside; however, is quite cramped. I think I would prefer to sit at one of the outdoor benches rather than try to squeeze myself in a spot inside. (Although, I hear they are expanding?)  As for the coffee - I ordered a plain latte, which was good, but didn't blow me away. I hear the ""Morning Ritual"" is a must-try, but I'm not a fan of donuts so I probably wouldn't order it!  The barista was very friendly - asked me what song requests I had, and had good music taste which was nice! Nonetheless, this definitely is not the place to sit and get work done over a cup of coffee. I think I would always grab it to go. outside Latte",1
Coffee Shop 24,"6 check-ins This place is tiny. Don't stand around the door and creep on people who are trying to get in.  Coffee is decent, drink menu is unique, iced americano (my go-to drink at new coffee shops) was really great.  THE LIDS ARE AWFUL. Half my coffee dripped away after leaking from the lid. OHHHH it made me so angry. Ridiculous gripe I know but these lids were almost as bad as the biodegradable ones that are put on cups with hot coffee...  I'll be back for their iced americanos...I'll bring my own cup next time.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"My husband, my in-laws and I stumbled upon Fleet by accident last weekend; we were chasing a food truck that was unfortunately closed. Thankfully, we found this lovely little coffee shop right next door and ordered some of their third wave coffee.  Fleet's coffee is fresh and tasty, on par with the coffee I'm used to drink in Montreal. I had an iced almond milk latte and my husband had a double espresso; both were excellent. Fleet deserves a perfect rating for its coffee and courteous service.  The venue is cute but unusually shaped, and unfortunately sits only a few people at a time. Some partially shaded seats are available outside, leaving you at the mercy of the hot Texan temperatures. This is definitely a downside, however it would not refrain me from visiting again.  We are happy to have found a nice coffee shop in Austin and we will visit again for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Absolutely fantastic! This is my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. The art and passion for coffee-making shines through here.  Definitely try the Morning Ritual if you're a fan of donuts. Just do it, you won't regret it. They have two options for espresso and I tried both kinds in a cortado and they were delicious. They also have three different coffee beans for pour overs. Again, I tried all three and my taste buds were in heaven. The pastries and tacos are tasty as well.    The place itself is quaint and cozy with a chill atmosphere. Inside is a bit small but they have a patio with long tables so it's nice to sip delicious coffee outside.  Service is extremely friendly. I've been served by Lorenzo and Patrick and they both are always happy to strike up a conversation. It's intriguing watching them make drinks because their coffee-making process is so technical, precise and neat looking.  Fleet has gained a loyal customer and this place has become my new addiction Two different espresso options and tried them in a cortado. Both were delicious! Latte and blueberry muffin",1
Coffee Shop 24,"This shop is one of my favorites in Austin and there is a ton of competition in this city! The space is beautiful. Nothing extravagant, just enough. The barista was welcoming and knowledgable about everything we inquired about, even the tea and its benefits. A lot of coffee shops I've been to tend to know a lot about their coffee, but that's where it stops. The iced tea my mom had was tasty and helped her upset stomach. Our espresso was wonderful. We also ordered two seasonal drinks that were both creative and well balanced. They weren't too crazy or overly sweet and both tasted great. I kind of wish I had one right now. Seasonal drink: ""Sandia"" iced coffee, fresh fruit punch, simple syrup, bitters and mint Really love this space Fruity pebble milk and espresso HELL YES",1
Coffee Shop 24,"This coffee shop was a little bit of a drive from me, but with the great Yelp reviews and being a coffee lover I was game for driving to give it a try.  They have parking right in front of the store and are across from Dog and Duck Pub and Revolution BBQ.  It is a very small, but cozy set up.  There are a few small tables, a bar looking out the window with bar stools, and some outdoor seating.  The owner\barista is very friendly and is happy to answer any questions you may have about the coffee.  They have some very interesting and unique coffee choices which sets this shop apart from others.   I had to go with the morning ritual because who doesn't love a donut hole with their coffee.  Couldn't resist also trying a cold offering and the flip top (root beer, chicory, and coffee) caught my attention.  Neither coffees disappointed and overall it was a great experience and worthwhile trek. If you are a coffee lover this place should definitely be bookmarked and on your short list of coffee shops to visit.  I'm pretty sure you won't leave disappointed. The only thing I would say, I probably wouldn't plan on coming in a large group unless it is a nice day to sit outside.  Definitely a great place to enjoy some 1 on 1 conversation with someone however. Inside. Morning ritual See all photos from Charles Y. for Fleet Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 24,"2 check-ins Listed in Best of the East Side, Coffee Shops for Writers Fleet makes a fabulous addition to East Austin's cafe scene. I thank the coffee gods for bringing such a great small business to my neighborhood.  The cafe offers a bunch of original coffee concoctions. I prefer the simple espresso drinks, especially the macchiato. The coffee is Goldilocks perfect: not too hot, not too cold, not too bitter. But on a hot day, the Claro is great: this is Fleet's lemony twist on an ice-coffee meets beer shandy (without the beer).  If you are hungry Fleet offers pastries and tacos for breakfast. I'm not sure if there are all-day food offerings.  The space on quiet stretch of Webberville road is small with a simple aesthetic: concrete, wood, tile, and glass. There are two large picnic tables outside if you want to spread out.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Very friendly guys running this cafe! I enjoyed my iced coffee, and The Morning Ritual (cortado infused with donuts) was on point! I really felt like I was drinking liquid donuts. They say they're looking at making drinks inspired by Momofuku Milk Bar so think something like fruity pebbles infused coffee. Yum. There's seating inside and outdoors, plus a clean bathroom. You can easily find street parking and there are a few parking spots right in front. Iced Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 24,"38 check-ins This review is a long time coming, considering how often I go here -- I don't know much about coffee (not, say, as well as I should considering I'm a daily drinker), but I ran into one of the owners months and months before they opened and I was excited about his coffee pedigree and the location of the store -- right beside Lost Well, right across from Dog and Duck, a nice, much-needed convenient pre- or post-boozing coffee shop.  After months and months and months of delay, they finally opened, and I was there opening day. The place is smartly and tastefully designed inside, with an eye towards minimalist aesthetics (or aesthetic minimalism, if you prefer). The focus and passion here is coffee, and it shows.  I've been here multiple times, from morning to afternoon to early evening, and have been greeted warmly and by name by both Lorenzo and Patrick, the owners/baristas. They've guided me on a journey of coffee appreciation, and they'll recommend something new, or fix me an old standby with the same passion and dedication.  The prices are quite comparable to other coffee shops, they will make coffee to go, and they also sell bagged coffee.  I enjoy sitting at one on of the little tables inside, or at the window, reading, or working online (free wifi, yay!), or chatting with Lorenzo or Patrick if they aren't rushed or busy. I now no longer think that coffee is best served with copious amounts of half and half (I've never enjoyed black coffee until I started going to Fleet), and that coffee can have a flavor profile as every bit as complex and layered as a craft beer or bourbon.  The place is small but not cramped, not really a hang-out place, but there's only so much coffee one can consume in a sitting.  It's a warm, intimate, inviting place, and I have high hopes that they stick around, and I've recommended Fleet to friends and foes alike. Cappuccino by Lorenzo....",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Knowledgeable baristas, a good selection of drip and espresso, and a beautiful space - Fleet Coffee is everything good in a coffee shop.  As other reviewers have said, I wouldn't plan on nabbing a seat inside as it's pretty small. But I have no issues with that, and there is outdoor seating for larger groups.  We don't live close by, but it was worth the drive to experience it.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Newest coffee shop in Austin (as of this post) and it's a great addition to the Webberville area. Now the only major downside is it's size. This really isn't the type of place to go and hangout or try to get some work down as there are only about 3 tables and a counter area inside with something like 4 seats. There is also a table outside with about 6 seats (IIRC).  That being said, the coffee selection is superb. Also, the area itself is being developed so there are things to see and do. You can take your coffee to go and just kind of wander. I got myself an almond chai latter and did juts that. Staff was super friendly too. I would definitely return sometime for a cup.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"2 check-ins Fleet Coffee knows how to deliver when it comes to coffee! The small coffee shop offers a variety of coffees and tacos/pastry goods.  The shop's small size makes it more of a come and go place, where you drink coffee and catch up with friends, meet random friendly Austinites, lovers, ex-lovers (on second thought..), dogs, maybe even cats in strollers?  I ordered the Iced Latte and it was on point, and at a decent price. The Morning Ritual is something I'll have to try next time; who doesn't want a donut-infused espresso with a donut hole on the side?!  Beautiful interiors, a decent amount of outdoor patio space, and lots of street parking, Fleet Coffee is definitely the new hot coffee spot in east Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Where to start? Modern shop with plenty of seating both inside and out to relax.The lattes we had were delicious. Strong, yes smooth. Just how it should be. The baristas were welcoming and kind. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Huge, huge fan of Fleet Coffee. I'd give them a fifth star if they'd start carrying soymilk, but my almond lattes never disappoint. Patrick is incredibly nice and a great barista. They've done a good job with the outdoor space, so once it's not hot as Hades, I look forward to enjoying my coffee outside.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"I moved in to the neighborhood near Fleet Coffee and figured I should give it a try. It has become my favorite coffee shop in town! The quality of the coffee is absolutely top notch. Each drink is made with attention and care, so you get the same goodness every time you go. The folks who work there are all fantastic as well. They make an effort to get to know their customers, which is super cool.  If you get there early enough, they have Tyson's Tacos for a good breakfast. Pastries are great as well.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"2 check-ins This place is great! Their espresso by itself is delicious, and their coffee cocktails are even better. I'm not even a fan of donuts but their morning ritual is fantastic-espresso mixed with donut milk! It's the perfect start to your day.",1
Coffee Shop 24,Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Austin. Fantastic coffee! The donut infused Cortado is everything you want it to be. Really cool vibe and will have an awesome outdoor space very soon. Really enjoyed it Fleet Coffee,1
Coffee Shop 24,I ordered a latte and it was delicious and you can feel the great quality of the coffee that he uses (the barista) so I'm so happy I'm from Colombia and I like good coffee so this a a great example and I recommend to try the ham and cheese croissant,1
Coffee Shop 24,"Cool new coffee shop on the east side. Better coffee than Cuvee, so I'll be back. It is super small so definitely not a place you want to come to hang out in.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Normally when you think of a coffee shop what comes to mind is a spacious room with dim lighting and a pretty big focus on the interior design. However with Fleet this notion has been turned on its head; for all the right reasons.  The interior of Fleet is quite small, and while this may take away from being able to sit on some huge armchair and either pass out or space out on a laptop; it encourages the people in that space to converse with one another, or better yet the barista behind the counter.  As is a hallmark of Lorenzo's attention to detail, the staff at Fleet are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the product they are serving & I highly recommend getting into conversations about the quality of the beans they receive, because they'd be more than happy to tell you.  Since (as stated previously) the space is small I also recommend visiting during an off hour so you can enjoy the coffee without having to wait in a long line out the door, but no matter what, you're bound to have a great experience visiting Fleet.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"The baristas at this snug little coffee shop serve up some delicious espresso, and they do it with a smile.",1
Coffee Shop 24,Great place drove by on accident but was rewarded with a killer iced coffee.. great find i highly recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 24,"Run by two veterans of the Austin coffee community.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.  Their coffee knowledge and attention to detail clearly comes across from the moment you enter the shop.  Currently a multi-roaster shop with Wild Gift, Olympia, and Mad Cap.  Two espresso options, three pour-overs, and four speciality cocktail style drinks.  Morning Ritual (the doughnut hole one that everyone instagrams) sells out early though!",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Fleet Coffee finds itself situated on a burgeoning strip of Webberville, with modern architecture and large windows defining this new age of retail. Right next door, you could have a two-fer during your afternoon 'spro and beer combo; Dog and Duck has relocated next door to Fleet.  Some folks from Medici made their way to the deep East to begin providing quality coffee below Figure 8. I can appreciate the way they have married design and coffee here at their new shop.  The quarters are tight and small, but if you can land a spot, you could cozy up for a full work day here. Layout is not ideal for long hours, as it stands, but the coffee will keep you coming back. Some shops in town have fazed out Madcap as of late, but Fleet is using it to the best of its ability. The 2-person Chemex is also a nice addition to the menu; I always enjoyed how the larger portion tastes.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"2 check-ins First to Review Beautiful coffee shop with a range of espresso, pour over and unique coffee drinks. Very friendly people who are knowledgeable and passionate about coffee. Good taco and pastry options. Nice location in the Webberville neighborhood. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Excited for Fleet as an excellent addition to Austin coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 24,Great coffee and really cool space. Love the simplicity of their branding and their ability to make a lot out of small shop. I came here first on a trip to Austin in May and had the Claro an  iced coffee/lemon juice/bitters combo that was delicious and unlike any coffee drink i'd had. This time around I stuck with the cappuccino and wasn't disappointed. (Pro Tip: make it there early in the day to snag delicious breakfast tacos),1
Coffee Shop 24,"I've been to just about every shop in town and I love a few of them, but this one is the best! Patrick and Lorenzo can not only craft a cup of coffee like the best of them, but they're also so welcoming and spark up conversation every single time you walk in. This shop will be famous in no time.",1
Coffee Shop 24,Amazing place for coffee. It is worth a trip for a great cup of coffee. The customer service is amazing. They really know what they are doing and willing to answer any coffee related questions. Great place to check out.,1
Coffee Shop 24,"The coffee here is fantastic! These guys know their stuff! Minus one star for how tiny the place is, but hey, that's not their fault. I'm hoping for big and better things from these guys! Watch this space!",1
Coffee Shop 24,Absolutely wonderful espresso! They were playing excellent older country music when we were here and had good baked goods. I may never leave. Barista was friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 24,"Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I made a special trip here within weeks of its opening, not being on the way to anywhere I go, now that my primary commute is to the Eastside from Northwest Austin. In Cherrywood for the summer, so I hope to return soon, and to find that they haven't expanded their menu or space since my first trip. This scaled back edition of the minimalist coffee shop aesthetic is scaled up in intimacy and attention to detail. How could it not be, though, there's nowhere to hide?! Hah. I ordered my standard for comparison, The Americano, and it stacked up. Actually, I remember it being better than average, but can't remember why. More incentive to return soon. It seems to have become a crowd pleaser among Yelpers, mostly people making special trips like me, which leaves me wondering how many local people know about it. The size constraint does not make it ideal for setting up shop, but that is what makes Fleet exceptional, the smaller internet cafes in Austin are wall-to-wall with Macbook drones, too, whereas this one is just small enough to best serve people walking through the neighborhood, who want a quality coffee to-go. Perhaps they'll linger to banter with the owners who, as other reviewers mentioned, are incredibly charming and knowledgable.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"I live a block from this spot and was SO pumped to walk in and see the love they've put in to the space. Comfort and style - for these reasons I over looked the fact that I paid way too much for a cappuccino. Today I try again...1 drip coffee (in my own cup) for $3 :/ Was hoping this would be my new favorite, but geez. Again the look and feel is lovely...but we'll the price, is a latte.",0
Coffee Shop 24,"Delicious coffee, the most gentle minimal environment that is efficiently organized for such a small space, and really friendly service.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Best coffee shop in my neighborhood, and so glad they opened. The owners are great, the coffee is top notch, and this place has quickly and happily become part of my morning routine.",1
Coffee Shop 24,Love this place. They're doing some fun and really creative things with coffee - REALLY GOOD coffee.  I had the ET and it was stupid delicious!  Can't wait to go back and try all the other interesting concoctions.,1
Coffee Shop 24,"Total awesomeness. Great selection of roasts, unique menu of really interesting coffee drinks (doughnut-infused milk + espresso + doughnut hole :)?), and spot on range of pastries & tacos. The espresso i had (Madcap roast) was one of the best I've ever tried anywhere. The space itself is beautiful, and the guys running shop are super friendly and cool. Couldn't be happier that this place is now in our neighborhood!",1
Coffee Shop 24,"Fleet is my go-to coffee spot when I'm in Austin. Lorenzo, one of the Owners/Barista is extremely knowledgable and passionate about his craft. Fleet has unique drink offerings that are sure to please every palate, like the ""Morning Ritual"" that is a Cortado with a donut infused milk. Fleet features beans from well respected roasters as well (Olympia, Madcap, etc). Do yourself a favor and take three minute trip east of I-35 and give Fleet a try!",1
Coffee Shop 24,Fleet Coffee was awesome. really nice taste of coffee and I love this place and indefinite come again again. thanks you FC.,1
Coffee Shop 24,A awesome new place to savor a well-crafted cup of coffee! I tried the Flip Top and tried the Greybeard breakfast taco. Both were delicious! The Flip Top is meant to be sipped. It's full of complex flavors. The location is small so not the best place for studying or hanging for hours. They sell bags of whole beans too. Don't be afraid to ask for a recommendation! These guys know their stuff Stopped by after dropping my friend off at the airport! Wish we had a place like this up north!,1
Coffee Shop 24,"I like the nice, bright space they've created here. I ordered a latte and they nailed it. Looking forward coming back.",1
Coffee Shop 24,Fleet is just what I needed. Some very fine coffee and great service. Innovative drinks  with skills you won't find anywhere else. So glad these guys are in the neighborhood they are life savers.,1
Coffee Shop 24,"One of the best cappuccinos I've ever had in my entire life - super quality coffee and owners who know their stuff. A close friend of mine is a professional barista and well immersed in the coffee world, and she recommended this place. Hit the nail on the head!",1
Coffee Shop 24,"This was our first visit here and by far this is one of my favorite coffee stops when in Austin! The menu offers you some interesting choices in addition to the typical ones. Doughnut infused milk & espresso got my attention. The combination was wonderful! If you're looking for the more traditional option, the cappuccino was solid!",1
Coffee Shop 24,Great new quality coffee spot! Friendly baristas and refreshing shop lay-out. The iced latte was particularly delectable!,1
Coffee Shop 24,"Friendly nook, should be a morning staple for locals on their way to a busy day or coffee enthusiasts looking for something new. Interior is minimally furnished, but fine outdoor space and a great stop for a peacefully energized start to the day. Menu is funky, intended to play with traditional flavors. Note: have not tried food menu as of this review, but it looks and smells delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 24,"A welcome addition to the robust Austin coffee scene.  Three different choices on pour over (which I always appreciate) and my Kalita was on point.  Beautiful indoor space, but probably not big enough to study in.  Overall, add Fleet to Figure 8/Houndstooth/Patika upper tier of Austin coffee options.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I love coming to Mozart's - they have amazing views, great coffee and dessert! I've never had a bad experience here.  I usually get a cafe au lait - it's excellent! One of my favorite things to do here is to pick a good spot on their wooden deck on a nice autumn evening.  I wrote a whole post about my experience at this coffee shop. You can read more and see a ton of my photos on my blog - zoyaandme.com. The holiday decorations at Mozart's are really pretty!See more photos from the trip here on my blog http://zoyaandme.com/. Loved the sunset on the Lake while at Mozart's. More photos from the trip are up on my blog http://zoyaandme.com/. Saw this gorgeous swan while having a coffee at Mozart's. More photos from the coffee shop are on my blog http://zoyaandme.com. See all photos from Lena P. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I visited with a friend and I really liked the place!  They have a wide variety of desserts and plenty of drinks to choose from! I had a lemon bar and a chai latte - both of which were great and I can't wait to try more. Customer service was good - they were really good about making sure everyone was tended to. The lighting inside was a bit dark for my taste, so I'm not sure it's the best place to get work done at night, but the location is great and there is plenty of seating outside that overlooks a lake. I went at nighttime, but I'll definitely be back during the day to enjoy the view on a good weather day.  Overall this place was great and I can't wait to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Listed in Americano Location/ Atmosphere: + Parking wasn't too hard to find + Great scenery + Plenty of outdoor seatings available (perfect for when the weather is nice out) - It was so hard to find seats with shade and avoid the glare from the sun (both indoors & out) - Wifi is apparently really slow but my macbook didn't connect with the password ""mozartsnet"" for some odd reason :""( o The indoor seatings were packed around 5pm and cleared up by 7pm!  Coffee Desserts Selections: + Serves Amy's Icecream! + $2.99 for an Iced Americano and great scenery. ($.50 cheaper than Cream Whiskers WOW) + The Americano tasted pretty smooth- it was good. -Their cold brew and other drink selections were more expensive though. (~$4 to $5). - We weren't super impressed with the chocolate croissant (one thin line of chocolate buried in the center) although it tasted great.. they could've drizzled some more chocolate on top/ center.  I'd probably come here again when I need to study with my textbook/ for happy leisure reading. Not when I need an access to the internet! :"") Hot chocolate + Light show :"") Iced Americano ($2.99)",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Updated review 2 check-ins Buy 4 bags of coffee, get the 5th free! Highly recommend their Hyde Park blend!! -bit on the pricey side, but makes a great present :)",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Such an awesome place to have some coffee or baked goods. There is free wifi and both indoor and outdoor seating. The view is spectacular of lake Travis. There are fishes, ducks, and turtles on the lake.  Parking in the area is a bit limited due to having more than one restaurant there. If you don't find parking in that same lot, there is more parking  across the street.  I had the mozart's mocha special which tasted so good. I will definitely be back again. See all photos from Kristin S. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Scenery 10/10. Coffee 10/10. More can you ask for !  Mozart can be super casual, super romantic, super exciting, super calming. This place has more out door seating than indoor. That's because they have a big patio that is two stories high. It looks over a beautiful lake. You can watch people riding their boats, jet skis, etc.  They had so many choices of drinks it was hard to choose! I tried their latte on tap and it was really good! who knew! ice latte on tap? The price range is just a little on the pricey side but i think its worth :)  I really enjoyed coming here with my best friend. I would definitely recommend this place for any occasion ^^ Hazelnut Latte Large",1
Coffee Shop 47,"This is a pretty famous cafe. On the weekends, it's usually so busy that you have to park in a parking lot up the street. The cafe has a board walk type vibe and you can sit in a lovely indoor patio overlooking a nice view of the water. The coffee is strong. But I gave this place an extra star because of the combination of the view and the pastry selection. They had honest to god home made churros that were to die for!",1
Coffee Shop 47,One of the best coffee places in Austin. Right on the water with lots of outdoor seating (and shade). Beautiful views of Lake Austin. And you can get endless coffee if you're working there for a while. Parking can be a bit difficult though.,1
Coffee Shop 47,"5 check-ins Tons of drink and pastry choices. The parking is minimal but there is parking across the street. All things aside .. the best thing about this place is the ambience and the view of the water. They have yearly events around Christmas and do an amazing light show with music. It really is amazing and worth sitting out in the cold weather for a few minutes! There are usually a lot of students during the school year but you don't feel shy because there are plenty of adults there, too! hehe  I really love this place and would go here all the time if it were closer to where I live. Thankfully they are a ways out for me so I don't end up spending a fortune on their drinks and sweets.  The service isn't the best so just be patient and remember the view is awesome! :D",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Updated reviewI give This 4-stars because of its beautiful views of the lake and the ambiance in general.  Their coffee and tea is not anything that has blown me away. It's definitely good, but not much different than other cups of coffee and tea you can find around the area.  On the other hand, the views from the coffeehouse are unbeatable by any other coffeehouse in Austin. You can relax and just watch the sunset while you study or work. It's a great place to meet with friends (both small and big groups) because of the amount of seating available. The cafe is almost always full during peak hours, but there is good enough turnover so that you should be able to find seating fairly quickly. The outdoor seating is also perfect for those days that Austin weather cooperates.  Their deli items are good, but again, not much different than you could get at a typical cafe in Austin.  I definitely recommend coming here, though, during your visit to Austin, especially for the view.",1
Coffee Shop 47,I love this place! They have great view and best Frappos! Came here everyday when I was in Austin haha!,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Great coffee with bottomless cold brew and pastries. You can watch the coffee bring ground up in the corner, then walk outside and enjoy the view on Lake Austin. Parking is a bit of a mess, but the view is well worth it.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Come for the coffee and stay for the view. This place has amazing reviews and it deserves it. It sits on the lake and there's a couple of restaurants nearby.  They have a good amount of options for dessert. I got a tiramisu and Mexican hot chocolate. The tiramisu was too dry unfortunately. The Mexican hot chocolate tastes exactly like ""Abuelita Hot Chocolate"" which isn't a bad thing!  Lots of seating outside, inside not so much. This was a must stop in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Let's start with the fact that the view and feel of this place is just simply the best. I wish I lived in Austin just to come here every weekend and sip on coffee.  Shaded porch overlooking the lake, so peaceful, I can't imagine a better place to relax with a cup coffee. We only ordered an Iced Draft Latte and hot vanilla latte but they were both fantastic. Would definitely return!  Note, bring your pup to relax with you and enjoy the free wifi! Honestly I wouldn't want to spend a Sunday morning anywhere else!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Wi-Fi passcode is mozartsnet  This is one of my favorite coffee shops around. The view is priceless, coffee and food is great as well",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Went to have a special treat with the kids and was super disappointed.  While I am trying to wrangle three boys, the ""barista"" hands me steamed foam and says the coffee is over there to complete the drink I ordered- cafe au lait.  I thought when you ordered a drink, it came complete and that I wasn't required to do the work.  Is this laziness or is how they do things.  Either way, I think I'll just go to Starbucks next time.",0
Coffee Shop 47,"I have no idea how the coffee is at Mozart's. I've always been here late in the evening, so I've just never had the coffee, or at least I don't remember it if I have. The Italian sodas are good, and the ice creams (Amy's) and desserts are quite good. Add the lakeside and the live music and the crowd, and usually it's a magical combo that's greater than the sum of it's parts.  Quintessentially Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I am reviewing their light show! Mozart's light show is absolutely amazing. It blows my mind every year, and it's different every year! There are some songs that are the same but they do always change it up. There is plenty of seating and they don't pressure you to buy anything while you watch the show. Mozart's light show is definitely something you must see when you're in Austin for the christmas time. Pre-light show",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Love the vibes, iced mocha and macaroons and sweet birds serenade, and then the phone rang. Jerked me back to reality, ouch!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"This place is great when visiting Austin! Beautiful scenery, amazing desserts, and great coffee drinks- they also have smoothies! Try the mousse- so creamy and great flavor! The iced cappuccino is unique and really good- and the smoothies are made fresh with filling! See all photos from Genessa W. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters",1
Coffee Shop 47,Amazing view. But very bland cappuccino. I feel like chugging a glass of warm milk. My first time here so not too sure if its a one time mistake or not.,0
Coffee Shop 47,"Listed in Vegetarian Food + Austin This is my kind of place. Beautiful view of a lake. Peaceful atmosphere. And a lot of outdoor seating.  Clearly other people also enjoy this place. The number of tables available here is insane, but it was still nearly impossible to find seats on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We wandered around and kept finding more floors and more taken seats. We finally found a table on the corner of the second floor that was free.  Things I noticed while wandering: The lower floors were much quieter than the top ones. Indoor seating is very limited, so probably not a good idea to chill here if it's hot or raining.  I'm not a coffee person, so I was looking at teas/smoothie/dessert options available on their menu when we arrived. Then I saw they had gelato. Then I saw they had vegan gelato. Yes! I ordered the vegan gelato which was a blended combination of different berries. It was delicious.  Parking will probably be a struggle, but they have a larger lot across the street.  I wish Houston had more coffee shops like this. If only it wasn't a concrete jungle. Vegan gelato",1
Coffee Shop 47,"This place is the very definition of Austin, or at least what I think it is. Coffee, live music, and outdoor seating by the lake...doesn't that just scream Austin?  Came with a friend on a Thursday night around dinner time and found that it was surprisingly pretty crowded. The inside is pretty nice although most of the appeal, I suppose, is in the outdoor area where they had someone singing. Additionally, their bathrooms are located outdoors if that's any indication. Nonetheless, they still have plenty of seats indoors if that's not really your scene.  The people working there were super friendly even though my friend and I asked way too many questions and took forever to pay.  Even though it was nearly 100 degrees, I ordered a hot vanilla latte and an espresso mousse cake. I thought the latte was fine, although it was a little bitter for me (someone who doesn't like coffee). The dessert I got seemed overpriced to me, especially considering how mediocre I found it to be. It was literally just a dry cake doused in espresso, kind of a weird juxtaposition if you ask me.  But I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I really just love the vibe and the coffee honestly is good enough for me. Also, their other desserts look really good so I'll have to come back and try them another time! Vanilla Latte and espresso mousse cake",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Nice place to get coffee with a view. it has a huge outdoor deck area that sits on the lake. Pet friendly.  They carry your regular coffee shop fixes. Drip coffee, espressos, blended drinks. And then there is ice cream, a huge variety of baked goods and a few food items. Had the empanadas and quiche before. Both pretty good. not anything extraordinary but perfect for something to have with my coffee for a light breakfast.  Fun light show on the deck during the holiday season.  If you are in the area, definitely stop by! Latte and quiche with a view of the lake!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Be it a sunny or snowy, this place never fails to impress. Great variety of coffees, ample seating area and cool crowd! Love it!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"loved it so much went twice...not the best breakfast tacos in ATX but great view, coffee, vibe.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I came here from out of town. I was recommended this place by a close friend of mine and we came and being unfamiliar with the place we were, what any newcomers would do, checking out the menu. The two lady cashiers that were working today were very irritated that we didn't know what we wanted. When I finally ordered, I paid and the cashier threw my change on the counter.  I work in customer service; I feel if these two cashiers were nice and more welcoming they would have gotten a tip. If they act rudely to customers, they do not need to be this type of business. I also found a strand of hair in my gelato, but i felt it was not even worth it having to talk to the cashiers.",0
Coffee Shop 47,Mozarts is the best! They have the best location next to the lake and you can even watch the sunset here. Food and drinks are ok-nothing special. I don't come here because their pastries are super delicious or anything. They have lots of seating area outside and everyone there-even the customers-are all very friendly. Top notch hangout/study place!,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Decent coffee and assortment of desserts, excellent views of the lake with plenty of seating, birds chirping...what else do you need to accompany your pleasant day drinking coffee? Perhaps live music but this is pretty close to being the prefect coffee shop. I live in NYC and there are literally dozens of fantastic coffee shops. The flat white I had here was badly made. It's the barista, stupid! Not the beans. Coffee meets dessert",1
Coffee Shop 47,"After hearing all about this from locals, had to check it out!! Right off a pier and it is beautiful. Quaint perfect spot to grab coffee and hang around if wanted. Amble seating. After sitting outside by the pier and rain showers came on, we headed to what we thought was inside, but it was another outdoor area with a roof! Will definitely be coming back tomorrow and the day after that Menu! Morning goodies :) Great entrance way! See all photos from Jennifer B. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Love this place. Can't get much better than sitting on the edge of the lake sipping a delicious cappuccino and watching the ducks and turtles.  Plenty of shade and seating outside.  Service is usually very good for as busy as they get. If they forget something, they always hop right on it. That's only happened once in a couple years.  The cappuccino is a proper drink as well with full ristretto shots and a creamy foam on top.  I had the strawberry cheesecake this past weekend and it was incredible. Creamy and whipped, light, and rich flavor.  The parking is tough but across from lake Austin Blvd you can park in the extra lot.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I have come here many times.  On a date, with an old friend to catch up, late night after dinner for coffee and dessert.  It's perfect for anything.  They are open late.  They are right near the lake which is awesome.  Sometimes parking can be difficult though so beware.  How can I not give some place 5 stars that has java!  They're coffee drinks are delicious.  Their desserts are a wonderful way to end a meal.  Even if the parking lot looks super packed, and the lines are long...there are plenty of seating available.  I don't think I have ever had any issues with that.  If you are in Austin, you must try this out before you leave!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"4 check-ins Great spot to relax and unwind at the end of the day. Bring a book, a laptop, a friend, or nothing at all, just go for the coffee and the atmosphere. There is a great outdoor space with plenty of seating that overlooks the water. If being outdoors isn't your thing, there's plenty of indoor seating as well (upstairs and down), with large windows so you can still enjoy the view. It's such a relaxing place to enjoy coffee and conversation. Love this place. See all photos from Olivia H. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I absolutely adore this place! The location cannot get better. I live in Austin so I know the best times to come (when there aren't as many tourists around) and when not to. I love the coffee here and the chai tea is wonderful! I've never had a bad experience. Also, the wonderful light display they have during the holidays is amazing! Mozarts Christmas lights",1
Coffee Shop 47,"4 check-ins The coffee's not anything to write home about but when you've got an almond milk latte in your hand and you're sitting in the January sunshine overlooking the lake it tastes glorious!  The location is what makes this place somewhere I keep coming back to - so much outside space there's always a sunny spot (or a shady one if you're so inclined) to sit in.  The coffee is good, not great, but definitely good - and they are always super accommodating of special requests.  Pastries are better than they look.  Mid range prices, ever charming service and good wifi mean I'll never complain about coming here for a meeting or a catch up.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"This is my favorite spot to get stuff done on my laptop while having an awesome scenery and getting wired with delicious coffee! I love sitting in the patio during the day with the view of Lake Austin. The one issue I have is the wifi. It's tough getting a good connection at times, but other than that I love this place.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Fantastic place for a number of reasons, first being the environment. Great for intense work, creative writing, or reading. The coffee is pretty good, the pastry looks much better than it tastes though, which is not to say it's bad, but don't overindulge the first time, you'll waste it.  Other than that, this place is a find!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"A view of the lake, indoor and out door seating, quiet people, loud people- they've got great atmosphere going on! The line is a bit long, but I can see why people come here. Families come and students study. They've got free wifi and a lot of space.  The coffee was pretty mediocre, but I'd definitely come here often to get things done or catch up with friends. They've got their own merchandise for sale, some sweets to go along with the coffee, and friendly baristas behind the counter.  Keeping Austin cute!",1
Coffee Shop 47,Amazing coffee and ice cream with a view. Enjoyed the trendy coffee shop on the deck with friends!,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Best latte in Austin and I'm from Seattle, so I know. Creamy delicious goodness. Full of people and great outdoor seating. Can't beat the location.",1
Coffee Shop 47,Most relaxing cup of coffee I've ever ever had. The outdoor seating faces the river and boathouse and ducks and turtles and fish so keep your eyes open. Crowd was relaxed and quiet so you can bring work or just sit and think.  Service was nice and coffee was great. I'd also recommend the poppy seed cake which was a lot more filling than we expected.  Would love to come again! See all photos from May K. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Excellent service. Welcoming and friendly!  My friends and I ordered 2 pastries that were not that great. We shared our thoughts with the manager, not trying to get free food or anything. He was very kind and receptive. He acted on our complaints immediately, and checked the freshness and of the desserts in the display case.  He made recommendations to us for the pastries that he liked. He gave us a sample of the items before serving it us. The samples were truly delicious. We got to reorder a carrot cake and a chocolate cake. Both were superb!  No complaints in the coffee department. We got a Vietnamese iced coffee, twas great. They were roasting a fresh batch of coffee, as my friends and I watched through the glass like creepers.  =D They were roasting coffee behind the glass",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Here's a qualifier, this place is great for it's awesome outdoor deck, but the coffee .... eh.  I came here to get a flat white and they were a little confused about what I was asking for. This really looks like one of those mass production, touristy type of coffee places, except that they have free wifi, food, lots of (not so good) pastries, and an amazing outdoor space you can hang out in.  The inside is madness, there are usually two lines to order but you can't really tell, people don't really know what they want and spend anywhere between 5-10 minutes ordering sometimes two drinks. The drinks are ok, but the atmosphere is fun. The staff is friendly (but confused) and is eager to help in whatever you need. I enjoyed my ""flat white"" despite the coffee being quite bitter and the shot burned, because the deck is awesome.  The parking here is also dismal. But then again, you're not here for any of those, just the view right?",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I think a lot of people are rating Mozart's based on the lake view and the surrounding shops. The pastries are ""ok"". They look good visually and there's a big selection but they sit out and get dry easily. I've never had a good one nor as anyone I know.  Regular coffee is ""ok"" and anything else tastes like someone poured a pound of sugar into it. But you're dealing with high school kids, not coffee baristas, so I guess its to be expected.  There's about 100 better coffee shops in Austin and even more places that serve up better food. Parking is brutal as well.  Nice view though :)",0
Coffee Shop 47,"Cutesy, late night coffee shop on the lake that's definitive of Austin.    Awesome patio area over the lake coupled with live music as you drink coffee or snack on some desserts (stand cafe options: cakes, pastries, ice cream/gelato).  Like most places in Austin, it's pet friendly too!    We got their Mozart coffee ice cream that is made in house and their Mozart Mocha Special.. it was pretty damn good.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Wonderful find here out on the lake. Plenty of sweet treats in the bakery display. Coffee is very great quality. Everything comes out very quickly. You tell them what you want, and you get in less then two minutes or so. You can sit inside or out by the water. Very pretty overlook. You get ceramic dishes and cups unless you get something iced or specify to go. I'd say it's a unique place to go. It was packed when I went and had to pay for parking but still didn't take away from the experience. You won't be disappointed. Truly an Austin gem.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Awesome coffee shop by the water. Worked here for hours and had the greatest time. Came here stressed and left in a great no stress mood. Bottom less ice coffee - such a great deal! Cool vibe by the water, nice staff, and clean bathrooms. Seriously can't wait to come back.",1
Coffee Shop 47,eaisily one of the coolest in Austin perfect for a first date! big Thanks to yobored.com for giving me my new favorate coffee spot,1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins This place is great to drink a coffee and have a pie seeing a beautiful view. I've been there couple times and the atmosphere is very nice, especially because of the lake! I already tried apple pie and cannoli and of course many types of coffee. The apple pie is good but I didn't like the cannoli....just nothing special and no taste. People go there with family and groups and there are many students using tables with their computers. This month of December they have show of lights with Christmas song every end of each hour. Parking is free and is crowded but there are many spots in both sides of the street. I think almost $7 dollars for a small pie is expensive, maybe they are charging this price because there are many tourists and visitors over there. Most part of staff is friendly. They have wifi but it doesn't work because many people are trying to use it at the same time. So....I think the view worth it more than everything at this place. 4 stars because food and coffee are ok, nothing special to me and really expensive. Also the line to order is big and slow sometimes. Awesome end of Saturday afternoon @ Mozart's deck Coffee + canolli + autuum Canoli",1
Coffee Shop 47,"4 check-ins As they all say, you come here for the view. Anyone that says the food/drinks here are fantastic are really just captivated by the decor and location of this place...or they have tastebuds that are off, who knows. That's not to say the stuff here isn't GOOD, it's just that it's heavily overpriced and presentation over quality seems to be their key to success. I've been here thrice and well, I don't know if I'll be voluntarily going anymore.  I've already forgotten what I got the first two times, but on my most recent visit I ordered their pumpkin shake. $8 for a ""large"" cup (think grande in starbucks terms). Of course, what I expected wa ssomething more of a ""venti"" but nope, this was their large. Now I don't know what it is about their sizes but it seemed like their small cup was just a thinner yet slightly taller version of their large, though not by that much. I wish I asked what the oz were for each size because it was bugging me the entire day.  Anyways, I ordered it on a whim, and on the receipt it said something like ""shake of the week"" or whatever. I didn't see the pricing because it wasn't listed anywhere.  The shake itself was a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and a pumpkin spice pie thrown inside. Ok well, think about it. Vanilla ice cream doesn't have that much of a sweetness to it as other ice creams do; it's a neutral ice cream that can go well with almost anything. Now throw in a pie with a 50-50 crust to insides ratio. That crust tastes like what? Nothing. The sweetness comes straight from the insides of the pie. Throw that alltogether into a shake and you get.....blandness.  An extremely thick and bland shake. Now I will say the pumpkin flavor WAS THERE, but the amount of pumpkin flavor in the shake did not qualify the shake to be called a pumpkin spice shake. If I had any say in what goes on in the menu, I'd say ditch the pie and replace it with a syrup or better yet, trash this garbage item.  Of course there are a plethora of other drinks you can consume here, so I can't really say much for those. I'm no coffee connosseiur, but I did have their coffee here once or twice. Look at the other reviews for their take on the coffee.  Their fruit tarts are rather basic too and their cannoli pales in comparison to other cannoli's I've had, primarily in the filling.  On the flip side, GREAT study spot with a GREAT location. The lights in the evening are rather pretty too...but again, presentation trumps everything for them here.  Also, there's a parking lot across the street that says Oyster Landing parking or whatever. Yes, it's free.  5/10, would come again if someone dragged me here.",0
Coffee Shop 47,"You can't get much more relaxing than a lakeside coffee shop. The outside patio, upper deck, and lower deck are also besutiful. There has been live music every time I've been there at night.  Always a destination whenever I make a trip to Austin. Mozart's mocha special",1
Coffee Shop 47,"The view of the water alone is enough to make me want to go back here. They have indoors and outdoors seating on two levels, so there's plenty of space and a niche for everyone. They offer bottomless hot or cold coffee as well. Aaaaand they have 8 different breakfast tacos, including two veggie options. It's a great spot to relax or to study.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins As many times I've ran by this place on my morning runs and tempo runs, I couldn't believe I never thought about coming to this place. Finally on my day off, I decide to come to this place partly because it was such a nice day and I need to get some work done for my class.  They have a private lot but it fills up pretty quickly and I was fortunate to get a parking spot. If I didn't, then across the street there's additional parking. When I go down the stairs there's a huge patio with people on their laptops and dogs just relaxing. When you enter there's two lines, it didn't occur to me to go to the other line which was shorter. Then again, I was thinking straight because lo and behold, there's the dessert display which is basically my kryptonite. Damn!  I was intrigued by the row of dessert cups and I tried the brownie tres leches which was so good. It went well with my iced coffee. What was even better was they had unlimited refills on iced coffee. Yes!  Remind me please to come here more often. Better to come in the early morning or maybe on your day off. Iced coffee Do you think I'll get a lot done? Brownie Tres Leeches Mousse.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"The atmosphere here is perfect! Inside it is dim lit with candles at every table, very intimate; outside is right on Lake Austin with chill, live music playing. The coffee and desserts are delicious!! The prices are average and you can get bottomless cold brew! I live in San Antonio but will definitely make this a place I stop at any time I'm in Austin!! So relaxing! The coffee and dessert are delicious!!!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Vegan friendly. Excellent location. Good coffee and tea. Vegan hot chili is tasty but sometimes it's not warm enough. They also have vegan tacos in the morning. If they aren't already prepared and available, don't order it. They take an insane amount of time to make fresh tacos.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Listed in Best of Austin One of my favorite coffee shops in Austin!    Right on Lake Austin, it has amazing lakeside seating!    The coffee is pretty good, and they have a lot of food options, including breakfast tacos (some of which are vegetarian or vegan), pastries, baked goods, and desserts!  There's a lot of parking in front of the store, but there's also a big lot across the street!  It can get busy though!  Definitely a great place to sit and drink some coffee and relax!  Can't beat that view! Make some friends in the lake! Awesome view.",1
Coffee Shop 47,Hands down best mochachino! Yum yum! And the view is amazing ugh Perfect for an evening coffee break! It's right on the lake ! And dog friendly !,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Fantastic vibe.  I love the coffee and its a great place to bring kids.  Bring some bread to feed the ducks, turtles and fish and watch your child's eyes light up.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Wished I came here at night, it would be so beautiful to see the light decorations.  Very relaxing to sit at the deck with their coffee and cake",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Really nice coffee shop that sits on top of Lake Austin. I love going on Saturday nights when they have live music on the dock/patio - couple the music with amazing coffee and the breathtaking view of the lake and you've an amazing place to sit, chill, chat with friends, and/or lounge around all night long.  Coffee is also really nice - they roast their coffees in house and their selections of drip coffee blends have varied nicely every time I've gone. It's like $3 for bottomless coffee - great deal and great coffee (all of their coffees are smooth with no astringency). They also have pastries, cakes, and ice cream; though I haven't tried any of them...I just stick with the coffee.  All in all, it's a great place to relax, study, bring out of town friends/family, etc.!",1
Coffee Shop 47,5 check-ins Best view in Austin from a coffee shop. They have the best outdoor seating with the best view. Drip coffee is expensive because they charge you for a bottomless though. A ton of excellent pastries & desserts!,1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Talk about ROMANTIC! When the sunsets, and you're enjoying a coffee on the deck overlooking the lake -- take a look at the couples around you who are ogling at each other and you know that some babies are definitely being made.  As I look at the sunset and sip my warm coffee I feel eyes ogling at me. Could it be? I look around me, guy at the other end of the beautiful deck? Nope. Guy under the massive tree erupting with Christmas lights? Nope. I look down..oh, it's my pug Goji.. staring at my cake. hmmmm. Well this cake is delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Great all around place, but they lose a star because they don't know what cannoli cream is really made of....seriously though a bird just shit on me right after I typed that!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"This place is awesome during any time of the year. Christmas is my favorite time to go because we usually get a couple coffees, sit on the main deck and watch the light show. They offer a cold drink, some sort of iced macchiato that is extremely sweet tasting and delicious. Their brownies and chocolate cakes are delectable, but their version of pumpkin pie left us a little unsatisfied.  A wonderful place to hang out. Part of the decorations for their Christmas light show.",1
Coffee Shop 47,The coffee is really good and the pastries were good as well but the staff has a horrible attitude. The view is beautiful but would not recommend if you come to hang out or come from out of town.,0
Coffee Shop 47,"This is definitely my favorite coffee spot in Austin along with my dad's. I think the coffee is ""good"", but more-so, I just love the scenery. Sitting in a chill environment next to the lake is very nice. I live in Dallas and go there every time I visit Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 47,View is excellent. Parking is brutal. Coffee is barely ok. The server who made the latte was rude. I regret ordering at this place!,0
Coffee Shop 47,"I am giving this place a 4 because the location, patio, and view are wonderful and a great place for locals and tourists! Do I think the drinks are just exceptional? Not particularly, but it's a fun place to go. Highly recommended around Christmas time when they have a really fun Christmas light show on the patio.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Love this for a study spot or really to just hang out. On a beautiful day in Austin, I will be here in a heart beat. They have a quite a variety of coffee, desserts, and surprisingly food (some sandwiches/wraps, quiche, bagels, chips, etc.)!!  Only downside is the unreliable wifi. The password is displayed everywhere but my computer/phone just won't connect sometimes. Probably because everyone and their mom is using it. Parking is no beuno either but what else is new.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Located near the lake. Mozart's can be doubled up as a great study spot or for a first date. They have Amy's ice cream, coffee, live music, and FREE WIFI. So many places to sit outside for a romantic evening. The only negative I have is that smoking is allowed outside *cough cough* I feel the cancer filling my lungs. Anyway! I love this spot and you can take your boat out too",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Listed in desserts & sugar I'm not a huge fan of studying at coffee shops, which is maybe the reason why I've only been to this Austin classic a couple of times. I love how it overlooks the lake and how large the space is. There are steps that lead downstairs, and you can eat, read, study, and sip your coffee on what feels like a dock overlooking the lake. It's pretty cool. It also has a super chill feel to it - even the writing scratched into the old wooden tables adds to that feel, as weird as it sounds.  I've gotten to try a lot of their dessert over the past couple of years, and they have a huge selection of them as well as dessert drinks. Absolutely loved their tiramisu cheesecake - it was the perfect blend of sweetness from the cream, tartness from the cream cheese, and bitterness from the espresso flavor. It also had a perfect blend of all ingredients and textures. Easily one of the best not-tiramisu-but-still-tiramisu desserts I've ever had. carrot cake, caramel chocolate chip cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake",1
Coffee Shop 47,"3 check-ins Listed in Austin - Favorite Food Places I am really surprised that Mozart's is not having over 1000 reviews because this is THE place that people visit for a good cup of coffee, a bite of sweet dessert, and a wonderful time with your friends and family. I wish I can actually count how many times I visited here; unfortunately, I can't because it's too many. I first found Mozart's when I was in college. It has been here for ... like forever. All UT students visit here for coffee, meeting, or for a good time. It can get pretty crowded, especially during the school time. Parking can get difficult but there is a parking lot across street from it that should provide a lot more spaces. I love it's next to a lake. It's spacious with lots of tables for all groups. For their coffee, I like their latte either hot or cold will work. On a hot Austin summer day, I like the ice cold latte. All the good memories I had here say a lot about this place. It's hard to describe the atmosphere here at Mozart's because you will have to visit to see it yourself. This is the place I will visit when I come back to Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Listed in Breakfast Austin The good: location, location, location! This is a beautiful place to enjoy lake views and (some) breeze. Bottomless coffee and iced coffee! You can get enough coffee for $4 to fuel a Himalayan expedition.  The bad: the food is blah. At least you're not paying $$$$ for it, just $$, so what you're actually paying is a location tax. I had a slice of quiche, and I think it was bacon spinach but I can't remember because it was unremarkable.  7/10, I would come here again to impress visitors, or to study all day. Not for quiche.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"Great coffee shop for studying! They have bottomless iced tea and coffee, making it your go-to stop when hammering in your homework/tests.  My only gripe here is that the menu items can add up really quickly. But that's not really the fault of the business; more like just me wanting to eat everything!",1
Coffee Shop 47,"2 check-ins Nothing beats the combination of a beautiful outdoor scenery, hot coffee, and a slice of German chocolate cake. Mozart's has it all!  The scenery here makes it a perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date for coffee and dessert. Indoor seating provides the comfort of a climate controlled room while still offering nice views of the river with their large windows. The only disadvantage with indoor seating is finding a spot to actually sit! Outdoor seating is even better with their spacious deck and multitude of benches and tables. If you get a table near the river, you can watch the sun set as you share your moment with your date (or mom, depends on whoever you end up taking!).  During the Christmas Holiday's, they set up a spectacular music and Christmas light show on their patio. The show is several minutes long and is suitable for both kids and adults. I was very impressed the first time I saw the show and it made a very memorable Holiday experience. They play it several times a night, but I don't remember the time intervals so it is best to call to find the exact times.  Great place to hang out for coffee, scenery, desserts, and Christmas light show. This place is a must-go if you are ever visiting Austin. Plan this in your itinerary after you check out Mt. Bonnell (which is only about a ten minute drive).  Parking is not easy here since the complex is usually full, especially during weekends, nights, and holidays. Street parking is also available if the lot is full. Delicious slice of chocolate cake with a cup of coffee Dusk Sometimes the river runs low and the scenery isn't that great. It all depends on what time of the year you go! See all photos from Danny L. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters",1
Coffee Shop 47,"two stars are for the awesome lake view.  pastries/cakes are terrible. we ordered the tres leches, it was probably the worst ever I had. It was like sugar syrup poured over a mushy pastry. we could see people leaving food on every other table.  So it's just not us. I like the ambience and spacious seating. It's not worth the extra dollars for that food.",0
Coffee Shop 47,"Have not been there in 20 years.  Baristas have the grumpy attitude of a salty bartender.   ""Stand in line"" "" did you order yet?""    Wow.   Their either hardened to West Austinite's or just plain rude.  You can't act this way you are working in a restaurant.   If you want that job go work on 6th street. Not impressed with their hot coco either.   Syrup in the bottom of the cup and a lame amount of whipped cream .   Get a grip not going back for another 20 if they are even open 20 more minutes",0
Coffee Shop 47,"I've been to Mozart's several times for meetings, with friends, and by myself. The number 1 reason I go back is because of their location on the lake.  The coffee isn't special by Austin standards, no pour over, french press, or other small batch brew methods. If you want brewed coffee, the only option is their bottomless cup which is somewhere around $3 so the price is great and the quality isn't something I'd tell everyone about but it's not bad by any means.  They also have a wide dessert selection that I haven't tried, but several friends have and said they were good.  During the day they can be a little busy and crowded inside, but if the weather is nice you should consider sitting on the deck anyway. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area or want to drink coffee with a great view.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I've been to Mozart's numerous times. There coffee was good at one point, yet over the last few times the quality of the drink has started to go downhill.  The decks are great and you are able to bring your dog(s). Yet, for whatever reason Mozart's is still behind with the times. There should be absolutely no smoking anywhere in the vicinity of the decks and still there is.  Until smoking is banned permanently Mozart's earns 2 stars.",0
Coffee Shop 47,"The best thing about this place is the view. Coffee is average and pastries taste like they were bought at a grocery store (think lots of synthetic icing on tiramisu).  Not a bad place to relax by the lake or do some work, but definitely not a place if you have any sort of culinary standards.",0
Coffee Shop 47,"Went Friday night after a big meal downtown. The Christmas lights show was spectacular as usual. My cortado was tasty and the fruit cheesecake was fabulous also. I thought that the chocolate mousse was boring and more like a Snak-Pak than a real mouse. The tiramisu was elegant, moist and just sweet enough.    The location is fabulous, however with the cold wind blowing over the water in the winter it would be nice to have some source of heat. My family and I got quite cold.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"I haven't had a fruit tart in forever (too long) and I contemplated ordering one this morning because I'm trying to not ingest so much sugar (worst idea). But my sweet tooth won out. I ordered the raspberry and orange with a bottomless coffee. I really like that they have soy and almond milk in the self serve area. The medium blend I got was really delicious, the flavors melded perfectly together, not too strong or intense. I also hd the lake austin blend and I really enjoyed it (the lighter blend). The fruit tart was amazing. I could sing its praises for hours. The tart shell is thin and coated in chocolate, the pastry cream was ABSOLUTELY to die for, it wasn't too sweet. I don't like thin crusts and I loved this one.  Today was perfect for sitting outside and just enjoying the weather/watching the water. I like Mozart's vibe, atmosphere and  coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 47,It was pretty crowded for a Sunday night. Not sure if it is always like that for the Christmas lights or if it was because the Trail of Lights was closed for the night. Needless to say they seemed pretty well prepared for the crowd and there wasn't too long of a line for hot chocolate because they had a number of places around where you could buy that and other treats. The light show was very fun to watch and reminded me of a way smaller version of the Osborne Lights at Walt Disney World. I would definitely recommend going there for some holiday cheer and delicious hot chocolate. Only thing is there weren't very many bathrooms so make sure you go before you get there!,1
Coffee Shop 47,it could get very crowded. The scene is a plus point. nice place to chill out for a while,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Found this cute little coffee shop next to the Colorado River. It was very very busy. Watching the guy roast the coffee beans right there was cool too. Coffee tasted great! Unfortunately our experience while ordering couldn't have been worse.The kid at the counter, who's name is James, had the absolute worst customer service skills I have ever experienced and unfortunately how many stars I gave is based on our interaction with him! I have never had someone roll their eyes at me because we asked for a mocha instead of a latte accidentally. He then proceeded to slam cups on the counter and act like a complete jerk. When I asked other employees what his name was no one even knew his name and told me that he was new. The view from behind the coffee shop.",0
Coffee Shop 47,"I really like this place a lot.  If I lived in Austin, I would probably treat Mozart's the same way I treated Urth Caffe in Los Angeles - a great spot serving excellent coffee and desserts on a relaxing outdoor deck which is a good place to bring friends or to get some work done.  By Austin standards, it's a bit pricey, but you're paying for the friendly service and the tables on the water, which are well worth spending another couple of bucks.  This isn't a place to grab coffee and breakfast on the way to work or to the airport, but if you need to kill a couple of hours on a nice day during the weekend, Mozart's is your place.  Food/Coffee: 5/5 Value: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 5/5",1
Coffee Shop 47,Coffee is just ok.  Crowed as hell. Line to get a coffee?  Light show is awesome. Something that kids would love a lot. Hard to see somewhere else honestly.  Service is poor. When paying with credit card there is a space for Tip!!!????? Are you serious? What service do you get here? Hard to find tables. You gotta clean it yourself. Employees rush you like you are bothering them. Sorry but this place do not deserve tip or gratuity at all,1
Coffee Shop 47,"When I lived in Austin, Mozarts was THE spot for me. Countless dates, hours studying, and hanging out with friends. I moved away, and this Thanksgiving I came home to Austin and shared Mozarts with an out of town relative. Experiencing REAL quality coffee shops elsewhere made me realize how awful Mozarts truly is.  1. Quality of drinks. They move people through the line so fast, forget about getting a decent drink. It seems their whole system is so rushed, they have one employee sloppily manning the espresso machine, and one employee just sloshing milk or whatever into your drink. There are so many things wrong with this. Good espresso must be freshly ground, balanced, and pressed. Milk should be steamed- not just poured from an unrefrigerated box on the counter. 'Baristas' don't pay any attention to the amounts of coffee and milk that go into drinks, leaving you with a grainy, too milky drink. Especially for a place that prides itself with roasting its own beans- the coffee consistently falls short of expectations.  2. They still charge $5+ for an espresso drink. Just, no. Horrendously overpriced.  3. Atmosphere. The place is always packed. Forget about finding a table inside. The good news is the outdoor seating is plentiful and comes with great views. However, if it's too cold, too hot, or raining, forget it. Also, the restrooms are outside, and not climate controlled. This leaves them feeling musty like a port-a-potty in the summer, and your bum with icicles in the winter.  If you are a basic bitch, touristy, Starbucks type person, you'll be thrilled with the subpar quality of Mozarts pandering to the masses.  If you're anyone else who actually has taste, skip Mozarts.",0
Coffee Shop 47,The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. I am here on a Wednesday afternoon and the crowd is light. The patio is quiet and a beautiful place to work. Their wifi connection is seamless and my black iced coffee is delicious! Not bad for a Wednesday out of the office. Light to medium crowd and still quiet and relaxing place to enjoy an outdoor coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 47,"Wow.. I'm from the DC metro area and we need a place like this! Bottomless iced coffee for $3.50! Also live music on the lake, you really can't beat that. There are plenty of seating and it's such a relaxing place to come hang out, study, or just simply to enjoy the view.",1
Coffee Shop 47,"We stumbled upon this place for a cup of coffee. I decided on the iced vanilla latte and a fruit tart. The tart was really good and the coffee was great as well. I loved the location and how it sat on the lake, perfect study or hang out spot. One of the best parts (I'm a huge customer service girl) was the staff, they were personable & charming! I would recommend this cafe! Mixed fruit tart & a vanilla latte",1
Coffee Shop 47,"3 check-ins I'm no coffee expert, but I am a college student looking for caffeine and a good place to study, so take my review however you would like.  I've been here before, and the biggest complaint I've heard is ""it's too expensive."" Now, I don't know if it's new or I just never knew before, but they have unlimited iced tea or hot coffee for $3.50, and unlimited iced coffee for $4.75. You can even add flavors (I had 3 glorious cups of pumpkin spice today, haha)!! I don't know if their roasts are good, or if they grind well, or any of that classy stuff, but it's unlimited, man.  My biggest complaint would be WiFi, space, and electric outlets. Yes, there's already a LOT of space, and they try hard with the outlets. It's just still risky, so if you can, go early, claim a spot, and don't leave till you're done. WiFi seemed to work for some, but not me at all. I ended up hotspotting when I needed to, then just working offline the rest of the time.  It's also an interesting demographic mix, since you'll see touristy folks and older people, then a ton of college kids studying. Can get a little noisy if you're doing hardcore work.  I mean, with a lake (isn't it actually a river?) view, unlimited drinks, and a hipster and classy vibe, what more can you ask for? Coffee cake + iced coffee w/a pump of chocolate syrup",1
Coffee Shop 47,"This is a pretty cool bakery cafe, which an assortment of sweets and food to snack on, and the view over the water is killer. There's also a large amount of sitting space so where ever you sit, you will enjoy the view. One thing worth noting though, is that although they do roast their own coffee, it's not to die for, and you can definitely find better coffee and coffee beans elsewhere.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Moon milk.  Condensed milk? evaporated milk? Sugar? honey? Half and Half? LITERAL milk from the moon? A mix of all of the above? ...probably.  No one knows whats in it, but man are the coffees with moon milk in them GOOD. Basically, Summer Moon has a milk concoction called ""Moon Milk"" that they put in their Winter Moon (iced) and Summer Moon (hot) coffee varieties. You can choose how much moon milk is in your drinks by getting a straight up FULL summer/winter moon (a little sweet for me, personally), half, or even requesting a quarter (not on the menu). My personal favorite is the half winter moon (I personally am not a fan of hot drinks - but the half summer moon is good too!)  If you're not into sweet deliciousness, you can also get more basic coffees/lattes (good beans, good flavor) and teas.  For FOODS, you can get had pies (personal fave is the goat cheese with red pepper and caramelized onion), sandwiches, baked goods, and breakfast tacos.  100% great place to hang out! 5 stars.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I go here 1000000x and I'm not sure why I haven't wrote a review yet. I've been trying to look for a good iced coffee and boyyyyyyy have I found it. I keep coming back so I guess I caught feelings for summer moon.  I tried out the moon menu with the moon milk that they use and I find that the ""moon menu"" is basically a dessert in a cup. I find that a good coffee on that moon menu is the half winter moon, if you're looking for ""a pick me up"" that's not too overly sweet or bitter. And we can't forget the mocha moon!! It's like a chocolate expresso and everything you can ask for :)  This place is a bit pricey as it adds up but it's actually cheaper than Starbucks and it's way better quality ingredients!!  The 16 oz is around 3-4$ that's cheaper than Starbucks if you order a grande (16 oz) and that already ranges to $4-5 for an iced coffee with some pumps of white mocha.  100/10 way to go, Summer Moon.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I just love Summermoon, really, what can I say that hasn't already been said on their reviews. They have a beautiful interior with plenty of seating for the area, fast wifi for my remote friends and friendly staff that light up the already bright space. I drive up to this location from my East Side Coffee-haven just because it's so damn impressive.  I'm not a caffeine snob, so I can't really comment on the quality of the coffee. I'd imagine the rankings would look something like this: Above McDonalds; Below the coffee Beyonce drinks. Yep, it's probably firmly nestled in between those. I will note that their house coffee (which is what I get 99% of the time) is alway freshly brewed, which is welcomed.  Overall check out their new spot up here on Burnet, it's worth the drive.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Love winter moon!!! that's all you need to know on a hot summer day (or fall day, they way Austin is this year). If you happen to be here around breakfast time - they serve Taco Deli tacos.  If you are stopping by for a snack - handpies are a must!  Love this new location, love their coffees, LOVE their special 'juice""! Love their iced drinks Skim winter moon",1
Coffee Shop 62,"A friend recommended the moon milk here, so I got the Winter Moon (iced latte with moon milk and espresso). I got my latte shortly after placing the order. The Winter Moon, which claims to have seven secret ingredients, has a general flavor of caramel. It was very sweet and it was thicker than your typical latte, due to the moon milk in it. Don't underestimate the drink; even a size small is quite heavy and it will probably take longer for you to finish than other lattes. This isn't the type of drink I'd have daily because of how sweet and heavy it is, but it can definitely be a treat every once in a while.  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4 Winter Moon",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee Summermmoon is probably one of my favorite coffee bars in Austin. They have fantastic coffee, a great line of drink options, and a wonderful atmosphere. Their staff is always super friendly and quick with drinks which is of course, always appreciated. It is no mystery while this place is always hopping. I do wish they had more room for seating, as there never seems to be ample seating for everyone. I've seen a lot of single people sitting in the middle of a big table spread out. Maybe instead of more bigger tables, some smaller tables would be a good idea?  Anyways, four stars for solid coffee, great atmosphere, and great service.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins Listed in ACL-Less Austin Summer Moon is one of my favorite coffee shops of all time in the world!  Sure, the shop specialty blend ""moon milk"" sounds a little sketchy, but once you had it in your choice of coffee, you wouldn't think twice about drinking something called ""moon milk""! While the wood-roasted coffee beans already adds a nice aroma to the coffee, ""moon milk"" adds an unique delicious taste that is perfectly sweet.  Whether you like your coffee hot or cold, in the form of latte or cappuccino, just choose a drink that has the word ""moon"" on the menu and you'll be good to go! I definitely recommend grabbing a cup here for perhaps one of the best coffee you will ever have.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"5 check-ins Summer Moon Coffee bar is a great addition!  I love their wood fired beans.  Something a little different.  While I find their coffee blend a bit too overpowering done as espresso, it is fantastic as an iced coffee!  I sometimes will splurge and add some of their special moon milk.  The moon milk is delicious but VERY sweet. It is a special blend of secret ingredients that they make themselves.  I found out that I can just ask them to reduce the level of sweetness when ordering a drink with moon milk (Very cool!).  I also love their affrogato's with Lick ice cream.  A great little treat on a hot afternoon.    The space is warm and relaxing.  They have free wifi and a good seating area to sit down and get some work done.    The staff are incredibly friendly and always seem to have a smile on their face. Nitro here is creamy, silky, smooth and delicious!! affogato w/ lick ice cream",1
Coffee Shop 62,Just popped in to the Burnet location for a bag of beans to go. But the people were super friendly and excited to see us. I live south so I frequent the original location when I need a caffeine fix and it was nice to see them up north as well. #moonmilk,1
Coffee Shop 62,4 check-ins Summer Moon is an adorable little coffee shop with a great vibe and great drinks!  Order anything with moon in the title and you won't be disappointed.  Today I had a Chai latte with half moon half skim milk and wow I must say it was probably the best Chai latte I've had! So good!  This place is also always packed! So it may be difficult to get a spot to sit but the drinks are definitely worth a visit.,1
Coffee Shop 62,FOREVER long wait. It was almost 10 am on a Friday morning and I still waited 20 minutes for a chai latte that was barely room temperature.  The chai itself was tasty but a bit sweet. I went for the vanilla chai because the spiced chai is decaf so maybe next time I'll go for a spiced chai with a shot of espresso. They do have almond milk which I always appreciate.  I'm gonna give it another try but it was pretty disappointing.,0
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins I always been a fan of Summermoon coffee just not a big fan of their 1st street location.  Their new location is so so so much better and impressive and spacious and beautifully decorated.  If you haven't had their Summermoon and wintermoon specialty lattes, you are missing out. Their ""moon milk"" is so good. Pretty sweet though so I usually ask for a quartermoon if I'm getting a sweet drink. Also, with soy milk or almond milk, it caaan seem a little too nutty.  Their black drip coffee is also good. They sell it at Tea Haus, if you've been. Lots of people come here just to buy beans.  Staff was crazy friendly. Love it! Black coffee Cranberry muffin",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summermoon is just wonderful. They have a huge menu of options, not to mention their specialty ""moon milk"" which they use in their drinks. It is heavenly! I've even bought some and used it when making french toast and it was delicious!! The staff is amazingly friendly, absolutely will remember your name and what your usual is, and they make the most divine coffee. This location gets slammed around 7:45 during the week, but it drops off by 9. The space itself is warm and inviting if you're looking for a place to read or work, or just visit with a friend.  My go to is a Half Moon Latte, which is 1/2 moon milk and half regular milk. It is just the right amount of sweetness for me. This morning I tried their Vanilla Chai Latte and it was so creamy!! It isn't as spicy as some chai's are, so just a heads up about that. Their Summermoon Latte is also amazing, it is made with all moon milk, but be warned it is sweet!  They also have affogato, nitrobrew, various baked good, handpies, and sell TacoDeli breakfast tacos! What more can you ask from a coffee place? Oh and they have a rewards program, after 10 visits you get a free drink. I think it only applies if you pay with a card though, but it's nice that they offer it.  They are rapidly expanding all over and I couldn't be happier to see a local business grow.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"19 check-ins I love this place.  Delicious coffees of all kinds. I'm particularly fond of the winter half moon, which I inhale as if I had been wandering in the dessert for months/starving to death/dieting for a year. Rich and smooth and delicious. Even if you get it with soy, it doesn't detract from the taste at all. I also really enjoyed the rich drip coffee. And all the baked goods, but especially that banana bread. Just take my money please.  I think the difference comes down to their beans. When you have well roasted beans and good baristas/technique, you really can't go wrong.  But really, staff is nice and work very hard. They never stop moving (I once watched them from the bar for pretty much an entire day...) and are excellent at what they do. The orders come out quickly and well made. I also love the decor. I love how plentiful outlets and chairs are.  Everything is great! Come here! Or actually, please don't, lest this place becomes well known and I can't easily waltz in and get my favorite coffee and sit in my favorite chair. One of the most delicious cups of drip coffee I've ever had",1
Coffee Shop 62,"The half winter moon is the best tasting iced latte I've ever had. It's the perfect amount of sweetness and doesn't taste as milky as most lattes. Seriously what's in the moon milk? I guess if we knew the secret, we wouldn't be coming back for more! This may sound weird but it almost taste buttery to me. I've been back several times and always order the same thing since it's so good and consistently good every single time. Come here and give them your money rather than going to another mediocre big name coffee shop, you know the one with the green logo. Half wintermoon! The best!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Got the Autumn moon which is the summer moon but with pumpkin spice. First question the lady taking my order asked was if I wanted 3 shots or 4? I was like whoa lol, just 3 is fine. Overall the milk was creamy and good but I wished I tried the regular summer moon first as I heard it's amazing. The pumpkin in the latte wasn't too strong and just had a decent flavor. I would definitely make my way back and try other options though!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"My buddy Eory was in the mood for some coffee after lunch at Shake Shack, and he recommended this place.  Knowing I'm quite a coffee fiend he knew I'd take the bait..    The place looks like a cool contemporary coffee spot,  which is very nice.  It sets them apart from your typical ""too cool to look contemporary cool"" coffee joints.    The staff behind the bar was very kind and gave great suggestions for what I was wanting to try.  The hooked me up with an Espresso ConPanna and an iced coffee blended with their in house sweetened milk creamer.  The espresso was dynamite!  A nice bitter sweet dragon punch to my tastebuds finished off with just enough sweetness to calm it down.  Loved it!  The iced coffee was also a great surprise. It was bold but not acidic and the sweet milk cream did an amazing job of thickening it without making it too sweet.  My buddy and I spent the next hour just chillin talkin while sippin our iced coffees.  Normally I put these away quickly but it was too good to not enjoy slowly.  The mood of the place is mellow and relaxed.  Definitely a place I'd like to visit again.    Best of all was the price!  Normally for two premium drinks like that I'd pay over $8 at most other coffee spots but here it was just over $5 and that is one hell of a bang for your buck!  Highly recommend you check it out if you're in the mood for a mellow place to enjoy premium coffee at a great price! Close up of the espresso ConPanna Ice coffee and espresso ConPanna Menu shot!

Coffee Shop 62,What is moon milk!? I will never know but I will be forever thankful for it. For some reason their summer moon/winter moon tastes a bit different from the south location. It's still good but seems a little stronger/less sweet? Not sure lol I also really like coming in the morning for some TacoDeli breakfast tacos (that is if I come before they run out).  This is definitely one of my new favorite study spots since I moved north. They have a good amount of big open tables and it seems like a lot of people come to just get work done. There are always rushes of people and groups just socializing but I still find it very easy to concentrate. There's just a magical balance of noise and music. I also really like the music they play which helps with my productivity.  The only thing I wish they did was stay open later. 8pm seems pretty early for a coffee shop but I guess I'm used to living near campus where more students need those late night coffee shops. It's unfortunate but I guess it makes me want to get work done faster. Summermoon Latte,1
Coffee Shop 62,"Stopped by this little gem right after my lunch at Chi'lantro yesterday. I am always in the mood for a little caffeine pick me up - I blame my years as a night shifter. The place is adorable with an ""exposed brick wall"" and semi resto-hardware industrial vibe. There is free wifi - probably a must for a coffee bar.  There is a menu board with all the usual latte suspects plus a few signature mixes. I had a moonbeam or something like that. I don't remember the name, but it made a delightfully refreshing mid day perk-me-up. I'd stop by again, if I were in the hood. I probably wouldn't cross town for it, but I'm lazy like that.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins It's been over an year since I heard of Summer Moon.  The hype over their moon milk was enticing, and I was truly interested.  However, the long delay of me trying it was caused by the combination of being no where close to a Summer Moon (fueled by laziness of driving through downtown), and I wasn't sure if they had lactose-free substitutes of their Moon Milk.  I was at the Chilantro next door with a large party and a couple of them headed over the Summer Moon for coffee.  I asked and they had almond and soy substitutes, and this place was definitely much closer and more easily accessible.  The opportunity was finally here!  After a 100-plus degree afternoon spent at Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park, I was drenched in sweat and needed re-hydration.  The perfect excuse!  Walking in, your nose gets hit with a strong wave of coffee aroma.  Stronger than Starbucks in my opinion.  This place really advertises for itself.  I ordered the Wintermoon with soy as well as a cup of ice water.  They hype is real!  The Wintermoon is an iced latte with moon milk and it was absolutely delicious.  It's very sweet, but since the drink isn't thick like a frapp, the flavors aren't overwhelming.  I don't like the taste of hot coffee, but I'm a huge fan of coffee flavored anything, so this drink is essentially everything I love in a cup.  If you need me, I'm here on the Summer Moon fan train.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This is seriously the cutest coffee shop I have ever been to in Texas! I love the simple menu and their ""moon milk"".... I ordered a Jess breakfast taco and a 1/3 moon latte",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Amazing Iced Mocha Moon! Can't stop going out of my way to get over here. They also have really good lemon-poppy bread that is gluten free. So hard to find GF breakfast items that taste delicious.  The lines and wait can be quite long throughout the day. My only complaint. If there are 2 people ringing up coffees the line goes by quickly but sometimes the line is to the door with one one person taking orders. Obviously, people love the delish coffee, pastries, and Taco Deli selection enough to wait. Plan accordingly!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins I've only had the winter moon latte and espresso milkshake, and I'm in love. I don't want to think about how much sugar is in those drinks, especially whatever is in the moon milk, but man I'm addicted. If you don't want a super sweet drink, just order a ""half"" or ""quarter"" moon latte, and they'll reduce the amount of sweet moon milk!  The wait can be long especially during the mornings, but it's worth it!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins ROTD Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Couldn't be happier that Summer Moon has a location in my neck of woods in North Austin!  Easily in my top 3 local Austin coffee shops. It's cleaner/newer/more spacious than their original location in South Austin--all pros in my book. If this is your first time here, have them add moon milk to your drink--you won't regret it especially if you have a sweet tooth. Be sure to also pick up a breakfast taco if you are there in the morning.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Love the atmosphere of this coffee shop! I would love to sit down, relax, and enjoy a book here.  The first time I went, I got the winter moon with soy moon milk. The barista told me an extra shot with the 20 oz was free so I opted for another shot. It was tasty, but a little sweeter than I like my coffee to be. Glad I got the extra shot or else it would've been even sweeter. I think they have an option to add less moon milk to reduce the sweetness. Gotta opt for that next time!  I went with two girlfriends from work and didn't have to wait long for our coffee. Awesome!  The second visit was only two days later. (This place is really close to work!) I didn't want coffee so I got the tropical tea with two shots of sweetener. Very tasty.  I really like this place and happy that it's near work! Love this brick wall Sweets on sweets They serve Tacodeli breakfast tacos. Score!! See all photos from Julie Boolie T. for Summermoon Coffee Bar",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins I am really impressed with this location. It's gorgeous on the inside.  What I love most about this place is the ample parking. SO MUCH PARKING. They also carry a lot of their roasts so it's a great place to pick some of their amazing beans.  I've had quite a few wood-fired coffee and Summer Moon is by far the most amazing one. I love the smokiness in their coffee especially in their cold brew.  Also you aren't limited to their moon milk being milk...I love that I can get an almond moon milk for the non-dairy drinkers out there, woo hoo!  My only gripes are they don't have the cool multiple usb awesomeness at this location that they do down south and they stare at me funny if I order an Almond Brothers...but other than that, I'm so glad I can get Summer Moon up north and down south.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"First to Review and 2 other badges If you like coffee and tacos and other baked goods go here. It's the same as the south location, but newer and larger. Way more sitting space, and just space in general. They also have bathrooms inside, unlike the south location.  The moon milk coffee is a thing of legend in Austin and it's finally available in north Austin. The tacos are brought in from outside, but they are delicious. The baristas are also a lot friendlier here than the south location.  Get a coffee here and you won't regret it!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This coffee is EVERYTHING. Do yourself some service and get the summer moon latte or the winter moon is great too. But the moon milk is SO.DAMN.GOOD you might just chug the iced one so, fair warning.  It's creamy, marshmallowy almost goodness and great coffee.  Place is super clean, nice, laid back. Similar to most coffee joints around here. Staff is nice and helpful. But in all seriousness, I kid you not... I've had two dreams of their winter moon since the first time I went last week. And I've already been back three times. That good folks.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This is a great local Austin coffee shop. The ""half moon"" is my favorite coffee in Austin hands down. (It will be sweet! Don't worry!) Go get one now. It always makes my day better.",1
Coffee Shop 62,I LOVE this place! All of their specialty coffee drinks are amazing and the whole atmosphere is comfortable and clean. They always play interesting music and the staff are friendly. Their is almost always a choice of seating as most patrons get their coffee to go (in the form of a constant line out the door on chilly days).,1

Coffee Shop 62,"A bit small and crowded, but staff were great and the coffee was very nice. The seating was nice, what there was of it. As for the moon milk, their specialty, is basically liquid sugar - not my thing.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I just wanted a quick coffee but I'm now drinking the most delicious godly perfect coffee ever. I normally don't take sugar in the coffee but I order the Summer Moon because I was intrigued by the ""7 secret ingredients"". It's sweet but there is something else going on in this cup. I'm blown away. I need this coffee in my life. I ordered the summer moon coffee. Sweet but there is a layer of sweet nectar godliness that's in this cup.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Decent location. Shared parking. The inside is absolutely unique and genius. Staff was nice. Menu was a little big for me, so it took a minute to understand and gather my thoughts as to what I wanted. After I chose, it was all gravy after that. Took a couple mins for my drink to be made. Grabbed a high seat at the tall table and enjoyed my $4 Mocha Late. Heads up, either you like it or you don't (Starbucks addicts) My mocha latte",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Updated review 2 check-ins Plenty of different seating options/configurations, lots of power outlets and work space for those with laptops. Dog-friendly outdoor patio with lights strung up. Warm atmosphere. Decent pricing. My Mocha Moon was great. Music was lively, but low enough to hold conversation easily.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Um, wow. This coffee was fantastic, service was amazing and the environment was perfect.  Service: It was my first time visiting the coffee shop, so I told the man taking my order that I wasn't familiar with the menu and asked for recommendations. He was more than glad to tell me all about the coffee and make a good recommendation for what I was looking for. The drink I got was called the wintermoon coffee I think, which was an iced latte. It wasn't too sweet, and the coffee flavor was indescribably good.  Atmosphere: The environment was great for working, studying or relaxing. Welcoming, cozy, and not too loud. They provide free wifi which worked quickly for me.  I will be going back.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Two words. Moon milk! The menu shows that there are 7 ""secret"" ingredients in the moon milk and I'm pretty sure one of the ingredients is crack. Whatever is actually in moon milk results in a delicious latte. I had an espresso milkshake with an extra shot of espresso. I'll definitely be back to try the moon raker the next time I'm in town.  As far as I can tell, Summer Moon appears to be a good location to get some work/studying done. The atmosphere is fairly quiet compared to your local Starbucks, but it was fairly packed for a Sunday afternoon. Espresso Milkshake with an extra shot of espresso",1
Coffee Shop 62,"As a vegan, it's difficult for me to find a coffee bar where there are non-dairy options. Not only did Summer Moon have dairy alternatives for their coffees, but the staff was very knowledgeable about their products, even down to the syrup, ""moon juice"", ingredients. I was incredibly impressed when I went in for the first time yesterday and I will definitely be back soon. For all of my fellow vegans out there, I recommend getting the half winter moon with almond milk, hemp milk, etc.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Oh. Em. Gee. I think I finally found my favorite coffee shop. What is this moon milk medley that you have created?! I know it's a secret so I won't keep prying, but whatever this heavenly nectar is that you've concocted it's amazing. I saw on Yelp people rave reviewing about their summer moon latte so I had to try it. My bf and I snagged one each and I was totally blown away; it's sweet, creamy, and actually 'velvety,' if a latte could ever be compared to that of a fancy plush couch.  I could handle drinking a summer moon latte everyday, but the friendly and helpful barista said that the half moon latte is pretty popular for those that don't want so much sweetness.  The interior is cute and simple, it's going for a 'cool coffee shop' vibe but is actually cool about it. So cool in fact that every single seat was occupied but someone on their laptop... maybe some more tables are in order.  Go order a summer moon latte.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I'm totally thrilled this place opened up.  Since I don't deal with ""mystery"" ingredients, I can't comment on their moon-milk type drinks, but they seem to be pretty popular. (My boyfriend thinks there's butterscotch in it, at least based on the hot chocolate.) Their Velvet black coffee or an almond milk latte are my usual orders, and both are excellent. In fact, given that almond milk latte is pretty much my ""test"" for a coffee shop, I think they're my #1 at the moment.  I like the decor a lot, and for me it's a convenient place to meet up with people. Parking is usually OK (I'd suggest parking more toward the LASIK-side for more spaces and less congestion). I also like that they have some gluten free food options. My favorite is the chicken pot (hand) pie.  My nits? The front door is freaking HEAVY! Also it's much too cold for my liking to actually work inside. So I usually stay outside and it's fine; there are only a few outdoor tables but I've never had a problem getting one. Sometimes if they are busy they are very slow getting orders done. It once took me 20 minutes to get my latte, but the dude realize this and delivered it to me outside! Also the hand pies are so good but they could be a bit bigger. :-)",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffee This new location is great! I've been to the original location on 1st several times, but it can be hard to find a seat/I find it kind of dark. This location is better lit and while the storefront is smaller, the layout is more open and I feel like there's more breathing room. Level of noise is good - not too quiet so you can't have a conversation but not too loud so you can get work done if you need to!  For drinks, my go-to order is the half moon. Next time, I'll try the quarter moon -- if you have a sweet tooth, even a half moon may be plenty sweet! I like it both iced and hot.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Really friendly service, cute workspace, and amazing coffee. I have a long drive ahead so I ordered the large iced mocha moon latte and after one sip, I was in mochalicious heaven. It's so velvety sweet, just right. I of course tried to guess what the secret seven ingredients are, but the barista is a pro and wouldn't give even a hint. I'm sure he's used to dodging the questions. While I try to figure out what the secret ingredients are, I'll just keep sipping my iced latte. The coffee shop Cute restroom",1
Coffee Shop 62,"They are known for their moon milk, which is a house secret.  It's a sweet milk base for their lattes.  I got the half moon milk latte, which is half moon milk and half regular milk to cut the sweetness.  It was delish!  Milk was steamed just right with just enough foam and espresso had a tint of toffee nut flavor. Will def be returning and trying their other concoctions.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Tacodeli and other food served here. I typically don't add sugar to my coffee, so I found that even the winter moon (iced latte) with half strength moon milk (flavoring with 7 secret ingredients) was a tad on the sweet side for me. Everyone else ahead of me ordered quarter moon milk, and I think I will do that next time.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I love everything about this place. I especially love their half moon latte which is just half the sweetness of the summer moon latte. If you like it sweet, then get the latter. It's a bit creamy but the flavor is so special where it's just this cup of a delicious latte. Occasionally you will meet a grumpy staff member but their coffee makes up for it. The atmosphere is great with lots of natural lighting and outlets making it a great place to get some work done. It's also a great place to kick back, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. I highly, highly recommend this place. They use wood-fired coffee beans..how interesting is that?",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I only spent about 5 minutes in this place waiting for a coffee, so I can't yet give it 5 stars like I'd like to but it reserves a good review because it's such a quality coffee shop.  5 Stars for Uniqueness...I ordered a Half WinterMoon which was sweet and delicious...Although I don't know what Moon Milk is; I certainly like the theme ;-)  It looks like this is a new location (a second location) and very popular already. Most of the tables were full with people on their computers. I noticed not only the coffee bar (love that it's a ""bar"") but also lots of yummies that I'm guessing some are gluten-free/vegan...They also had t-shirts for sale. So the brand is a really cute idea.  I love the vibe and I would definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I've been to the 1st St. location but glad to check out the Burnet location! Love their summermoon latte! Next time I'll probably take the quarter moon milk instead of the half moon milk because it was too sweet for me. But I still love it! The hand pies were pretty decent not sure if it is worth the price. We tried the bacon, egg and cheese hand pie as well as the goat cheese and carmelized onion hand pie. The staff were friendly. The room has tables to bring your laptop and plug in to do work but also can hang out with friends as well. Summer moon Latte! Mmm. So good.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Good coffee, horrible wait times. WHY ARE U SO SLOW? The line is till the door everyday. Maybe Summer Moon - 2 location is needed? Everyone reading this - please estimate 20 - 30 min wait time in the morning.  Now on the coffee - Half Summermoon is better than Summermoon (too sweet). In cold drinks, Moon Raker is good.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins My first time here & I love it! Definitely my favorite Summermoon location. I tried the 007 and my only regret was that I didn't get a bigger size. They have a ton of different pastries, too many to try at once. SIGH.... I guess I'll have to come back.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summer Moon stands out from the crowd with their moon milk. I love the moon milk in both their iced coffee (Winter Moon) and hot coffee (Summer Moon). Clearly I am not alone as it always seems to be busy.  It is often a bit of a wait but it's always worth it. Those who are short on time should try their Nitro coffee, which is on tap thus removing  the wait for them to make the expresso shots. The Nitro does, however, have a lot of caffeine so those who goes that route should be prepared for a caffeine rush.  In addition to coffee they also serve breakfast tacos, sandwiches, and baked goods from other local places. I am a big fan of the lemon poppy seed bread from Russell's Bakery. If you are looking to stay a while after getting your coffee, they have lots of seating including a few nice, big comfy chairs and some nice large tables for groups.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"So, so happy that one of my favorite coffee shops has come North!  I love the mocha moon and now I don't have to drive twenty five minutes to go get it :-)  I've had great experiences with all the staff I've dealt with. I love the design of the interior as well.  Welcome to the neighborhood, I'm so glad you're here.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"11 check-ins Love, Love , Love this place!! Every weekend (and some week days shhhh) I make the drive past at least 10 other coffee shops because this coffee is SO Awesome. A little smokey taste with their Super Yummy moon milk...Deeee Lisshshh. The long line that you may or may not have to endure is worth the wait. Summermoon is more than just coffee, it's an experience.",1
Coffee Shop 62,2 check-ins This place has been my go-to coffee shop every Saturday for a month so far. I love their wintermoon drink b/c it's super sweet. The shop isn't very big and many people are there to study so normally there's never an empty seat for a group of 3 or more.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Domainatrix What I really like about this place is their name: Cows say moo, but add that ""n"" and everything changes - moonlight, feels right, moon river, silver moon sparkling. It's a marvelous night for a moondance, under the Summer Moon.  It's not that I disliked the original South 1st location, it was just tricky to park there and the interior often felt cramped & claustro, in that hip & cool ""Keep Austin Weird"" kind of way. But those aren't issues at this new Domain location, and with the Chi'lantro next door and one small step to the newest Kor 180, what we have here is one giant leap for the Millennials.    The menu seems the same, try something with the fabled ""moon milk"" at least once (it strikes me as a really sweet condensed milk concoction), and then let me know how you like the coffee - sometimes I think I can taste the wood-fired process, but a lot of times I don't. What makes me a fan here is the coffee's hot & black, the staff is cool, and I can have my fifteen-minutes of uninterrupted social media time to write these reviews. Oh yeah, under the Summer Moon.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Updated review Had a really bad experience over the weekend. The cashier (a male) was really rude in the way he interacted with me and the way you spun the check out screen. He spun it with such force, it actually rotated back to the point where I wasn't able to complete the check out until the cashier came back.  I will not be going back.",0
Coffee Shop 62,"21 check-ins ICED CRACK. That is what the half wintermoon is. I don't know what is in moon milk. I know it's sweet as heck, which is why I get a half to dilute the sweetness a bit. But, seriously. These drinks are crack. If it weren't for how nice the folks running this place are, I would be suspicious of the ingredients. :)  The interior is really pretty and relaxing. Every time I have come it is full of people quietly working or studying. Great spots to sit and work. Nice couches if you want to sit and plenty of table space to work, even if you bring your small team to work on something together.  The people are so nice here too. They all obviously love the place and are quick with suggestions and explanations of the different coffee drinks. And they put up with me always telling them they are serving crack.  I'm just so happy to have this place up North. We are in dire need of coffee shops and Summer Moon rocks.  PS - They also sell the moon milk on its own. I apologize in advance.",1
Coffee Shop 62,2 check-ins I got the Winter Moon cold coffee and it was very delicious. I also like the fact that there is music playing but it's not obnoxiously loud :) definitely a great place to meet up either to study or catch up with some friends.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"Stopped in just to grab coffee. The waitstaff was friendly and quick to help us, and were able to ask menu questions.  The regular coffee was good, the mocha latte was excellent.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins I'm so glad they opened a Summer Moon nearby! I can't enough of the half summer moon. It's just something about their moon milk that they use that makes the coffee so smooth, lightly sweetened and yearning to take that next sip.  It's a cool coffee shop that you can set up shop there to work or study. It gets pretty busy on the weekends in the morning though. Be patient, it's worth it!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I am so disappointed today. My ""used to be my favorite""'coffeebar is now nickel and diming their customers for creamer! I have been coming here for years and today the barista tells me that I can no longer add moon milk to my coffee of the day. In fact, there is now an extra charge to mix this in with your coffee! It's sad to hear this because i felt that Summermoon was different than other coffee places that just wanted your money- I felt like the baristas valued their clientele.  Well, looks like I won't be coming back here anymore!",0
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins I came and tried Summer Moon Coffee Bar because of the rave reviews.  They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are, which is nice when trying a new coffee house.  I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar.  They have a variety of different types of seats from couches to tables for working with laptops, to a bar\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee.  I ordered a half summer moon latte as I don't like my coffee super sweet.  I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but it had a smooth taste.  My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet.  So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process.  They seem to be doing a good job checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to brew an ounce of espresso and adjusting accordingly, but watching the baristas tamp, it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure.  Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied.  This would explain the slight watered down espresso.  If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor.  It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of espresso which was very visible as I watched the espresso come out, as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure.  They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer baristas to measure the tamping pressure until they are experienced enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though, I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of Joe. Yes! Praise Jesus See all photos from Charles Y. for Summermoon Coffee Bar",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I loved Summer Moon down south, but it's a hike from where I live, so I could only get it as a special treat from time to time, or when we happened to be down south. I was BEYOND excited when I heard they were opening across from my work and I stalked them daily (because it was on my way to work) when they were building.  Anything moon milk is delicious there. I order off the menu and get a quarter moon, because the moon milk is very sweet. This seems to have the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I do know people who even order a 16th moon, so if you only like a touch of sweetness, try that.  They have great breakfast tacos and a small selection of pastries and things. They told me recently they may be getting tacodeli tacos soon.  New location is gorgeous, too. I like it more than the south location, however the south one is probably slightly better equipped for remote working.  My only gripe about the south location was the grumpy baristas, but so far the north location has been nothing but friendly and welcoming.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"So happy that my favorite coffee shop has opened up north! They are known for their moon milk, which has 7 secret ingredients in it that only the owners know. But it is a must try with an americano or one of the different versions of their ""moon"" lattes.  The pastries and hand pies are on point too. Always fresh and tasty. They carry Tacodeli tacos as well, but run out quickly. I like seeing that they have them in the mornings.  Staff is always friendly, polite and welcoming. Highly recommended!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Cute spot! Service is friendly and hospitable. Environment is lovely - what I would described as a typical feel for a coffee shop. Would be a great spot to work. I ordered a cappuccino to stay - they don't have the right cappuccino mugs so it's more like a latte that you're getting. It was ok, not amongst the best I've had. They do have coconut and almond milk options, which is a big plus!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I love coffee. Good coffee. Summer moon has good coffee. So I love summer moon.  Their south location is on every list of good coffee shops in Austin. They wood roast their coffee, which is unique. Shows you they care about coffee beans properly roasted. Great to see them open a location up north.  How can you know this is good coffee? get a cortado. It's the best coffee drink in terms of boldness and flavor. The cortado at summer moon is smooth, well balanced and delicious.  Next time you are at the Domain craving good coffee, get in your car and drive 2 minutes to Summer Moon. Your palate will thank you.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I love that this place is now in North Austin on my side of town.  I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.  I have no idea why this place isn't as popular as Blue Bottle or Stumptown. Admittedly, those coffees are good. I just think Summermoon has a special place in my heart.  Wood. Fire. Roasted. How does that not spell ""AWESOME"" in every sense of the word?! If I have friends in town, this is where I am going to take them.  I always get a half Wintermoon latte or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods. The stuff is sweet so if you are NOT a sweet coffee person then you may want to order it as a plain latte and add your own sugar. The full Summer/Wintermoons are too sweet for me...and I'm a *3-4 packs of sugar* in my coffee kind of girl.  It's not everyone's cup of coffee to have it be sweet, rich, creamy, with caramel undertones with a slight hint of vanilla. Some people even drink it black. If I did, I'd probably still think their coffee is the bees knees. Good lattes come from good coffee still...after all.  But it sure is damn addictive if you like it. And thankfully, only being 5 miles away, that means I'll be here way more often.  Nice, clean, and functional layout. They've got a few tables and places for seating. I love that they have a neat wood based aesthetic around the bar area. The industrial pipe shelving? I totally want to steal it.  It's not a study sort of spot in my opinion because the chairs are mostly bar height with some that are the usual lower height...but they don't look super comfy for an hours long study session.",1
Coffee Shop 62,The staff is so sweet here and I love everything I have eaten here. My favorite is the gluten free poppy bread! So yummy!,1
Coffee Shop 62,I would definitely recommend the half moon latte if you're not someone who is really into sweet flavors! It includes the specialty creamer mixed with skim milk to balance out the taste. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the things on the menu! The tables and chairs are very comfortable for people who want to study or work here and they have plenty of outlets as well as seating outside. Their music is also pretty easy going and not too distracting. My first half moon latte!,1
Coffee Shop 62,"Cute, comfy and unique spot. You HAVE to try the moon milk in whatever you get! I tried the 007 first and it was delicious. They also have pastries, bottled drinks and tacos from Taco Deli. I came and did some work on a Saturday and got a great seat. Wasn't too noisy or distracting. The employees were very helpful since it was my first time and I had some questions. Now it's my go-to since it's right by my apartment!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"My new favorite cafe. I'm a lifelong Starbucks devotee but this place is great. Starbucks might be one of the only major food chains that I'm crazy about, but when it comes to local businesses, I've got a soft spot.  I've always despised cold coffee drinks (when I DO drink coffee)...until I tried the 007 and the Wintermoon. I've been to Summer Moon about 3 times now and I'm so in love.  Try the Lavender + Honey cookie. It's a combo like no other.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins No more questing down south for Summermoon! Not that it isn't worth the trek. But now it's not required! The Burnet location is open and I am in trouble.  The liquid ambrosia they imbue into their lattes, called ""moon milk"", is smooth as silk and completely addicting. It's so delicious and rich that I actually enjoy the Half Moon (half sweet) variation. My husband loves their vanilla chai latte. They also offer a variety of delectable breakfast tacos, pastries, and hand pies.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for a flavorful treat! Now Open on Burnet! See all photos from Liz C. for Summermoon Coffee Bar",1

Coffee Shop 62,"Liquid heaven. I got a summer moon latte with an extra shot, and it was creamy and perfectly sweet. I don't know what is in that special moon milk but it works.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I'm a really big fan of summer moon and it's famous ""moon milk.""  The drinks are delicious and it's arguably my favorite coffee in Austin in terms of taste.  Try the Mocha Moon Latte Iced, the Winter Moon, or my girlfriend's favorite, the 007.  All of these drinks do the trick and give you that delicious and much needed buzz in the morning.  If you're looking for beans, this is a great place too.  My work commonly uses Summer Moon's coffee to brew in the office and it is just as good as the artisan drinks.  With all plusses come with minuses as it pertains to Summer Moon.  While the coffee is absolutely delicious, I am constantly faced with a pretty significant line from the hours of 7-10 in the Domain location.  This is a result of popularity of course, but some level of disorganization.  It certainly seems like the company could use one extra helping hand during these hours instead of having barista's constantly running back and forth to the register to take orders.  If you're coming in early, be prepared to wait a good 10-15 for your drink.  Don't come in a rush.  Thanks Summer Moon.  Despite my small constructive criticism you and your employees rock! Brandon",1
Coffee Shop 62,I had the half moon latte and my husband had this tropical ice tea thing and both were amazing! This place is good to go to if you like a cup of java in the afternoon . Definitely an afternoon delight! The have other healthy snacks and pastries as well and they are cheaper than Starbucks! I'm a major coffee snob and this place gets an A plus from this teacher!,1
Coffee Shop 62,"So excited we have one in North Austin! Their coffee is amazing and I've missed it since I moved from South Austin 5 years ago. 1/2 moon will always be my favorite drink- iced or hot. The pastries are from Russell's, so you can't go wrong with anything there. The interior of this location is lovely. I'm sure it will be crazy packed in no time. Everyone working on opening morning was very kind and seemed excited to work there. Thanks for fueling our caffeine addiction and giving us a GREAT coffee option so we don't have to settle for Starbucks anymore! 1/2 Moon. 100% delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Wow!!!!! Amazing coffee!!!! I have recently moved to Austin, and after seeing summer moon on tv I knew I had to check it out. I was so surprised by how awesome it is. The moon milk is the best part providing a smooth sweet finish. The fire roasted beans also aid in the smooth finish and never taste burnt. The coffee shop is super cute, and their t-shirts and mugs are one of my favorite parts!!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I've been here about 5 times.  Recently to work and buy beans.    When I check out a real coffee shop I always order an espresso or a macchiato. No sugar.  Just pure strong espresso.    It's balanced and consistent.  Crowd is good during the day.  Lots of seating options. Leather chair, bar stools, tables with chars, whatever you want.  When busy they do a great job of getting folks out the door.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Perfect. Wood-roasted coffee beans? O.M.G. I am ruined after having three different types of coffee drinks at Summer Moon on Burnet.  Oh, with the hot days coming up, you MUST try the Espresso Milkshake!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"The parking is pretty good and the location is very convenient.  The coffee options are quite good....IF YOU GET IT TO GO!  I have been in here probably a dozen times and each time, their music selection is obnoxious, to put it mildly.  First, the volume level of the music is always extremely LOUD.  Second, the music selection sounds like very angry grunge metal rock:  Screaming singers over the top of aggressive and wailing guitar riffs.  A girl can hardly have a conversation not to mention hear herself think about what she might like to order.  It is totally offensive to the ears!!!  Add to the mix, a stampede of people during their coffee rush hours and the ambiance is totally loud and unenjoyable.    Unless you are actually at a concert, or a honky tonk bar, music is supposed to 'season' an atmosphere--not become the atmosphere and certainly NOT OVERWHELM IT as at this Summer Moon!!  If I were the owner of this place and I walked in and heard their music selection and the volume to which were subjecting my customers, it would be a firing offense because it would be negatively affecting my business!!  Set the dial on a nice downtempo/chill/jazz station at a low enough volume to be AMBIENT and simply season your atmosphere--then, glue the volume knob in place so the youngsters slinging the coffee don't change it back to blaring grunge metal and crank it up.    Let your amazing coffee and the people enjoying it be the atmosphere--NOT the blaring, angry, grunge rock!!!    Pour mine in a paper cup and I'll take it on the road.....or, pop into a different cafe in the area for peace and calm to have a conversation I can actually hear.....",0
Coffee Shop 62,"I've lived in the area for a while and used to frequent Epoch on Anderson primarily.  Back in the day I lived down south near the Summermoon on South 1st so I thought I'd check out this newer location.  Overall, great experience. My cold brew is actually strong, my Tacodeli taco is as fresh as it can be, and the employees were very friendly.  Though I live closer to Epoch, this place won me over. Stronger cold brew, nicer employees (okay, not everyone at Epoch is rude, but there's a good amount with a serious attitude).  Check it out! Great job.",1
Coffee Shop 62,Everyone there is so nice! I custom order drinks all the time and they get it on the spot. Moon milk is amazing!! The moon Raker will have you up for days. You can buy moon milk by itself.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"I'm not exactly a coffee person, meaning I like the flavored stuff that cuts the bitterness. I don't think that would be necessary here! The coffee was smooth and not bitter at all. Staff was friendly and got it made very quickly considering how busy it was. Looking forward to going back and trying something new!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Northies rejoice! This part of town has been overrun with Starbucks for too long and I've been patiently waiting for a decent coffee shop to pop up. Thank goodness Summer Moon is here. Being pregnant I don't get to have coffee much, so when I do, it better be good. (I am actually writing this review as I plot my next visit.)  While they have a lot of the standard variations of coffee and espresso, their Moon Milk is what makes them extra special. Another reviewer said it's like crack and I have to agree. I am normally a bit of a purist with my coffee, drinking it either black or with just a little cream, but not here. The Winter Moon is my favorite summer treat.  Plus the aesthetic is nice, there is always parking and the baristas are friendly and very efficient so I have never waited long.  See you again soon Summer Moon!",1
Coffee Shop 62,Keeps me going! Love their variety and location. Great customer service. I will be back very soon.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"The halfmoon latte is one of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere is nice, the staff are friendly, and their products are wonderful.",1
Coffee Shop 62,So good - also so sweet. I recommend trying the half moons before ever daring for a full. The 007 and moon rakers are SO good. I only give it 4/5 stars because they seemed to have grown so fast there isn't ever much room in there and I really wish they were open later than 8pm!,1
Coffee Shop 62,"The coffee here is delicious and strong (try the Moonraker if you want a kick with a little sweetness), the food is yummy, the interior design is comfy and the staff are all friendly.  And the drinks cost less than Starbucks!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Seriously? Coffee has changed for me forever. Nowadays, I waltz into my kitchen on weekend mornings, order up a summer moon and then my husband looks at me like I'm totally bonkers.  I've been there about 3 times now, the breads are ridiculously delicious. Have I mentioned the coffee? No? The coffee is like playing with kittens inside of a rainbow. There's nothing else to think about. Just go get your own",1
Coffee Shop 62,Very smooth and delicious wood fired coffee- The moon milk is wonderful get the half moon if you don't want it too sweet. Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff... They have gluten-free options for pastries also..,1

Great business! 5+++",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Best place on Burnet for coffee! Staff is super friendly and patient no matter how many people are around, and the half moon latte is to die for! Honestly some of the best coffee I've ever had!!",1
Coffee Shop 62,Love this place!! Good atmosphere laid-back staff. A wide variety of drinks to choose from. The Taste is a little different from the south location but that is totally to be expected. Each Barista has their own spin on it.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"I think I've found my new study place for when I'm in town. I think I've also found my new favorite drink for when I want to treat myself.  The staff here are super friendly - the barista was quick to recommend anything with the moon milk and tell me about how the sweetness could be adjusted. I ended up ordering a quarter mocha moon latte, which was the perfect amount of sweetness and tasted so good that I promptly burned my tongue trying to take another sip. (Admittedly I've been craving a good mocha for a looooong time, but this really was amazing!)  There's also an ample amount of seating and lots of outlets. Even on a Saturday afternoon there were plenty of seats open with lots of people studying and people popping in and out for chats. They also have a nice selection of small bites for anyone who's feeling hungry. And also, the parking is a big plus.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Love love love this place.  Not only is the coffee amazing but the customer service/interaction is awesome.  We take our twin baby boys in once a week for a half hour or so and they always welcome us all.  Pumped about their cold brew on nitro (every other cold brew I've had on nitro pales in comparison) as well as their affagatos served with local Lick ice cream, with two vegan flavors!  So glad summermoon opened in north Austin and we will be customers for years to come.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Big fan of this place! Both the food and the coffee have been good every time I've been. Last time I was here, I ordered a basic dark roast and it was very rich in flavor. I love that they have a study area/room off to the side. I'm always able to be very productive in there because it is nice and quiet. They have comfy couches if you're just coming to read or hang out. The employees that work here are super friendly and helpful! They are accommodating of customer requests and are knowledgeable of the menu. The only issue I sometimes have with Monkey Nest  is that it can get really crowded. There have been a couple times I've had to leave because I couldn't find a spot. Other than that, I love coming here!",1
Coffee Shop 46,4 check-ins I'm a big fan of Monkeys Nest for many reasons. It's in my neighborhood. They have great coffee and specialty drinks like a spicy money mocha and espresso milk shakes. I like the breakfast tacos and the sandwiches. The people are friendly. There is a variety of seating. Some comfy couches and big chairs in the back. Tables with good light in the front. Plugs for laptops etc. It can seem a little crowded at times but I've always found a seat. There is occasional live music and I will check that out one day.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"Would be five stars if there were adequate space inside for the amount of people who are always there! The atmosphere is really nice and casual, and the coffee shop has a good set up to do work.  Have never had their coffee, but the pumpkin muffin is spectacular! Has a crunchy sugar-glazed shell at the top that compliments the fluffy inside.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins GET THE THAI TEA NOW!  I was driving around local coffee shops but they all closed and the other cafes that opened 24/7 were way too packed. Thankfully we were able to find a spot right against the window and it was the perfect seat!  First time coming here I got the Thai Tea and my boyfriend got an iced coffee with hazel nut syrup. The coffee was very delicious and had the perfect amount of syrup. THE THAI TEA THOUGH! I've never had thai tea that tasted as good as Monkey Nest Cafe's! Even at boba shops they don't have it this good. The tea and the milk ratio is perfect and the sweetness is on point! I definitely recommend getting this drink. It does not have any caffeine in it. Also get it in large because you will regret not having the most you can. The price range here is actually very reasonable. They also sell baked good, sandwhiches, pizzas, and other retail drinks.  One thing customers may not like about this place is how packed it is. they have a bunch of tables for students and others to come and study. However, it is always packed and so you kind of have to fight for a spot.  The second time i came here I got the Sea Salt Caramel Latte. It sounded really really good but unfortunately it was just ""alright."" It tasted just like milk and ice. Either there wasn't enough espresso or too much milk.  Overall the customer service is great here. The workers are super sweet. Try not to come here to study for finals or an important test. It'll be a little hard to focus with all the people around you and noise and the delicious food smell distracting you. :) salted caramel latte. taste like milk Ice coffee Large Thai Tea Large! please get it!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins I enjoy coming to this coffee shop! I never order any food so I couldnt tell you how the food is but, the menu does look appetizing.  I always order a black unsweetened iced coffee and its good!  The atmosphere is really chill. Plenty of seating and tables to do your work, and their are couches and dim lighting so its more of a relaxing atmosphere. Their is free WiFi as well.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins I always passed this place up thinking it was just another coffee bar.  Then my friend played there one Saturday evening, Kat Hale and the Candied Yams, so I drove up to see her play.  Initially I thought I'll get coffee and listen to her play and that will be that.  There is so much more there than coffee and it is all SO yummy!  By the time I got up there I had not eaten dinner, so I ordered a Crab Bisque soup along with an incredibly delicious Bacon and Spinach Quiche.  It was not one of those situations you frequently find yourself in at some random coffee bar where there is only only flavor of quiche and there is only one left from that morning.  Nope, no, sir, not here!  They had options for quiche, sandwiches, pies, empanadas, coffees, pizza, etc.  I couldn't believe it.  To me it was like a coffee bar finally woke up and said, ""People are hungry and finger food won't cut it!  They need options!""  Yes, we do need options!  More than something the size of our dang hand that does not fill us up!  Well, Monkey Nest gives you options people!  Once I got my food I discovered there is plenty of space to sit and talk, or study.  There was quite a large group of us there to watch Kat and Kyle play and we all had a great time.  In fact, quite a few of us ended up staying well over an hour after they were done playing because we enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks/food enough to stay.  I may live South side, but next time I'm North, I'll be stopping by. Kat Hale and the Candied Yams Live music",1
Coffee Shop 46,"I would have to say my favorite flavor of the iced coffee is the hazelnut one. It is way too tasty for my own good. I would like to drink one every day but unfortunately not from here. If I could I would. It's either Starbucks or me trying to find Austin's sense of coffee.  I think this needs to be an occasional treat for me, but if you are closer, then it should be a daily yum for you! If traffic is not so bad in Austin I would definitely come here more often.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins Every time I'd be cruising down Burnet Rd. I'd see this place and say to myself ""I am gonna try this place out"" but I was always in a hurry or I already had my coffee fix for the day.  But this time I woke up and deprived myself of my usual cup of morning joe and said to myself ""Nah bro..today you're gonna wait for Monkey's Nest Coffee!""  So my friend and I went down there to check it out.  As soon as we walked in you could smell the fresh ground roasted coffee in the air.  I knew i was gonna be happy already!  My go to item to test a coffee shop out is their iced coffee.  While I was deciding what to drink I couldn't help but notice just how much stuff they offer besides beverages! Lots and lots of food items and plenty of stuff pre-packed to go.  But I settled for a banana nut espresso muffin to go with the coffee.  Now they say their coffee is organic..and personally I can't say I can taste a huge difference but I did love how the coffee came out.   They give it to you plain with the flavoring of your choice.  It's up to you to sweeten and dress it how you like.  Most other places do it for you, but I like how they give me the choice to do it.  If you're lazy you won't like this at all, lol!  The atmosphere is very chill with lots of nice interior decor and the people seemed really nice.  The staff was very happy to answer my questions regarding their menu and items.  I have to come back and try some of their food items.  They look absolutely mouth watering.  But for now, I will just enjoy the coffee...  Super smooth and delicious!  Stop by if you need a coffee or snack fix. Espresso shake. When you wanna cheat treat and be hyper to burn the calories!! I know that feel, breh! I'm about that coffee life too, mang! A peek at their menu. They have whole lot more than just coffee and pastries! See all photos from Jesse C. for Monkey Nest Coffee",1

Coffee Shop 46,Updated review 22 check-ins I love this place. The staff and owners are terrific to us every time we come on. My husband loves the pesto pizza . I don't normally like Italian cream cake but all I cam say is wow. I had to get 2 Milks because it was deliciously rich. They charged me for the second milk But that's okay because I did not still have my glass. Their political Leanings are the same as mine. Definitely be back soon.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"Everything here is not worth paying money for in any year of any decade in any country third world.... Nasty.  Watered down iced coffee, dry cakes and monkey crap tasting mocha. At least starbucks coffee tastes like coffee. Tasted like tea and the spicy mocha thing, I don't even know how to describe it, just not coffee. Not drinkable.  The ambience is dead and dreary.  I will come back to give it another chance, I suppose. but right now this is where I stand on this. Crap. Eeeyuck Monkey love. I mean, spicy monkey mocha See all photos from Meredith W. for Monkey Nest Coffee",0
Coffee Shop 46,Listed in Americano I came by quickly with my boyfriend to get my Iced Americano fix. Staff was friendly and despite there being many seatings available IT WAS PACKED IN HERE. It was so loud in here and the tables are seemed way too close together... There's no way people can get productive studying done here. Friendly staff but very disappointed with our drinks. My Iced Americano (what I came by for) was SO WEAK! It was basically all water and barely any espresso shots. Also my boyfriend had ordered a hot chocolate. I didn't see it on the menu but when we asked they said they can make it.....nope. We got 95% water 5% chocolate. This is super disappointing for a coffee shop.  Wouldn't recommend coming here for drinks.... You just get water....,0
Coffee Shop 46,"Great coffee, great treats, great atmosphere. Fun place to hang out, study or have a friend-date. The lines are consistently long, so that's always a great sign.  Check it out if you're in the area and you're craving a great cup of jo.  Minus 1 star because the staff is hit or miss. Sometimes incredibly friendly, sometimes awful.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Super comfortable coffee house, with lots of seating and tables, electrical outlets, nice staff, and live music. This little gem has plenty of parking spaces & lots of food & drink choices: smoothies, coffee, sandwiches (vegan too!) and more.  I had a regular drip coffee with tres leches cake. Pretty good. Not awesome, but I'm a coffee & cake snob. I'll go back & order something different next time.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"I have gone to Monkey Nest Coffee when there is a musical offering (acoustic, for instance), or a Meetup of some kind. It is a cozy venue but you can tell from the parking situation outside that it is very popular! I like the muffins. Robert Harding.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"You can definitely judge a restaurant on their ability to function under pressure. This place has excellent, calm staff who can get stuff done.  Their credit card reader was out on both registers, during the morning caffeine-addicts rush, and they still served everyone within a reasonable amount of time. It was impressive to see the staff act as a well-oiled machine.  I had the Italian Panini at lunch and it was perfect. The ciabatta was not too hard, the prosciutto was salty and slightly crisp, and the mozzarella was melted perfectly. It also came with a pickle and chip and salsa. Which, is like all of my favorite things.",1

Coffee Shop 46,"Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX Monkey Nest was my second home during my thesis writing process and I honestly may not have finished my thesis without it. Their decision to go 24/7 last year totally revolutionized the Austin coffee scene, giving night owls a fourth option (in addition to Bennu, Epoch, and Buzz Mill) for places to set up base for long work nights. But Monkey Nest is much more than just an alternative to those places - it's a unique, reliable establishment with a lot to offer.  One of the qualities that sets Monkey Nest apart is their willingness to serve fresh food all night. While you may be limited to reheated pizza and stale muffins at other places, Monkey Nest will serve up fresh sandwiches and flatbread pizzas into the late hours of the night (or morning). Some sandwiches can be hit or mess, but certain options (like the Green Goddess) are especially great choices.  There's also a variety of prepared foods here that are quite nice. I was surprised (but happy) to see salads, house prepped oatmeals, and even a dolma platter available for sale. Of course, you also have your option of pastries and cakes (all of which are either made in-house or from local vendors), but having the option to get healthy snacks is a huge perk that I haven't seen in many other coffee shops.  There's a ton of seating inside, but Monkey Nest can get quite crowded during certain times of the year (think finals week for students). The wifi will drop off during the busiest times, but I've found it to be OK when I've needed it most. The parking lot is also basically endless, so it's never been a hassle to come here.  Lastly, the coffee is solid, reasonably priced, and effective. They have specialty coffee drinks that are definitely worth a try - I like the Spicy Monkey Mocha, Honey Luv Latte, and Monkey's Uncle. The Four Ton Gorilla is as advertised (four shots of espresso), so I would not recommend it if you are prone to heart attacks.  Thanks for being a part of my life, Monkey Nest!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Yes, it's a hipster place, but I found Monkey Nest to be a more enjoyable atmosphere than something like Starbucks. The breakfast items were perfect for a grab-and-go customer. I also enjoyed their smoothie. I saw some other interesting items offered like quiche and empanadas. I'm torn between telling more people about Monkey Nest and keeping it all to myself! I like the casual vibe; it's great for catching up with friends or working. The only negative is that I found it expensive for the quantity and quality of food. If you can spot the $, definitely a good place to drop by.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Awesome coffee place! I wouldn't say its the best but it is a pretty chill place, great for studying, socializing, working, whatever. There is also live music as well! And the lunch combos come with chips & salsa.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Food: Monkey nest special on ciabatta was pretty good, I like that they had a variety of breads to choose from. The cashier recommended me the spicy monkey mocha since it is popular, but I thought it was too spicy for me. The sweetness was the right amount though.    Study friendly? They do have a lot of tables available but I thought the tables were too small and being able to sprawl my stuff around is high priority. The shop was well lit and also has plenty of outlets.  For Pokemon go players: At the risk of sounding like a dork, this place isn't a pokestop even though the monkey nest mural right next to it is (it is so close to being within the vicinity it's upsetting), so sadly I could not collect pokeballs while studying :(",1
Coffee Shop 46,"3 check-ins Pretty nice place with good coffee.  Haven't been in a while, found on Yelp... now I'm craving their mocha.",1
Coffee Shop 46,Its good place to study at night But it is horrible at customer service at night. It was my first time visiting I ordered cake ( flourless) It was size of two of my finger ( very thin slice) for 4-5$.. Before barista cut cake he tied his shoes and then cut cake.. It was not clean. He was very rude Its very not pretty at all... It is horrible customer service he cut really thin and just pack it whatever.. It is not good at all.. 5$ about,0

Coffee Shop 46,"5 check-ins Opening 24/7, 7 days a week, Monkey Nest has got to be one of my favorite go to study spots for those late night cram sessions! Say goodbye to your local version of the Perry Casteñanda Library and hello to good vibes, roasty toasty smells, and ambient lighting. Coffee + Thai Tea are great, but I would not recommend any of the pastries. They taste fake and boxy and old. But you'll go bananas (heh) for the sandwiches! They are pretty good! But one time I ordered a drink w a monkey in it that looked pretty on the menu and when they brought it out it looked all scribally haha! Saturday nights are sorta loud though for studying because some groovy local bands come out to play! And music choice vary! From folky tunes to grandma swingy jazz (the grandmas were so cute btw LOL)! Btw they would really appreciate it if you be a good audience and clap/snap! Overall if you're looking for that perfectomundo ""late night coffee shop"" vibe like on Spotify, MN is your place to go! Let them have cake! Hot Thai Tea: cinnamon flavor will give your tastebuds that extra kick!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"YAY! This place is 24/7 now? My top choice for any time studying.  This place does get loud from time to time but of the all day and night coffee shop options, this is the best and here is why, 1) location is off Burnet and super convenient. 2) parking is strightforward 3) great food, great coffee 4) plugs at most tables 5) clean comfortable decor 6) friendly staff.  They also have cool events so coordinate your study time accordingly! Espresso Shake. Like thick coffee goodness.",1

Coffee Shop 46,"This is not just a coffee shop! They have delicious  lunch food, too! Great sandwich and salad menu. And their baked goods look amazing, it was hard to pick one (got the espresso banana muffin and it was perfect). Glad I work so close to this place, I have a feeling I'll be coming here pretty often.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"3 check-ins This is an amazing coffee place! When you pull up to the place it has a nice curb appeal. There is some monkey art is the parking area. We stopped here in the afternoon and surprisingly it was packed! There was a sign on the front door that said something about music not being played during finals week, so we guessed it was finals week. The store had many seating options, but few were available. Everyone seated by us were very quiet and I felt weird speaking in a low voice, so this seems to be a great study location. I am not a huge coffee person because it is never perfect, either too sweet or too much coffee aftertaste. I ordered a chocolate chimp and the first thing that caught my eye was the foam design. It was in the shape of a chimp. I didn't even know that was possible, perfect presentation. The taste was amazing as well, not too sweet and no bad coffee aftertaste. This is the greatest coffee I have ever had. Wish I lived closer, I would definitely be an avid coffee drinker. Monkeys uncle Chocolate chimp!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"My Nutty Irishman latte was ok, but it felt like the hazelnut and irish cream canceled each other out.  It was good, but didn't rock my world like the Espresso Shake did!  The Espresso Shake was absolutely amazing.  Its the best frozen coffee drink I've ever tasted, and among the top milkshakes I've ever enjoyed.  I will come back just to have this!  Very strong and rich, perfect consistency, perfect temperature, not too sweet or syrupy.  If you know anyone who loves coffee ice cream, you need to bring them here to try this!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins Top notch coffee shop! They have a really extensive menu, with pastries/desserts, coffees, smoothies, sandwiches, and more. I actually haven't tried their coffee (I had a smoothie since I came a bit hungry), but I really love the atmosphere the most here. Tons of little tables and chairs (perfect for working or socializing), some couches (perfect for relaxing/chilling/reading), nice warm decor. The people working here are also amazingly friendly! They also have live music oftentimes, which is pretty neat. Definitely a great place to get some work done or meeting with friends. And they're open 24/7!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Updated reviewWelp, it's been 2 days and we've ordered 7 drinks. Lattes of varying flavors (lavender, irish cream, hazelnut+irish cream, 2 spiced brown sugars, and almond+coconut) and it seems like they taste pretty similar with the exception of lavender. However, ALL were delicious and I appreciate a good latte. Spiced brown sugar is an excellent choice :) We also got iced tropical green tea with lemonade - it tastes nothing like starbucks, but was very refreshing and enjoyable!  We also got food today and were VERY happy. We ordered the chicken mozzarella basil pesto pizza, and the grilled cheese with chips and salsa. The grilled cheese was $4.99 with feta and mozzarella and was incredible. It's hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but it's always nice to get one exceptionally good. The pizza was very filling and the chicken tasted fresh. We shared both and were not hungry at all after.  We were helped by a different round of baristas from yesterday (where are you, Josh?) but they were just as nice and helpful. They checked to make sure our large order was correct, which I appreciated. Food came out fast, and I can't imagine why people would complain about the wait time. I'd rather wait a few minutes for them to cook my food than unwrap something to stick in a sandwich press.  Overall, Monkey Nest makes me wish I was staying in Austin this summer. Great place.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Monkey Nest! I really wish I had more reasons to be in this area of town. My lady and I were looking for dessert after some dinner in the area. We also wanted tea. Luckily, Monkey Nest has both! We snagged some red velvet cake and a couple of teas. Everything was great and reasonably priced. Service was friendly. This is one of those places that I thought could have suffered from bad hipster service. Not the case here. I just wish there were more parking spots and more places to sit.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Decided to try this place out and I will not be going back. Was recommended the the iced blended banana chai drink and it was pretty gross. I asked the barista if it was real bananas, so I assumed it was fresh.....not the case. It tasted stale and freezer burned. I asked my husband to try a sip and he didn't like it whatsoever, either. I had to toss it since the stale taste was that overwhelming. My husbands iced tea didn't taste like tea either. It was pretty watery. I told him the tea at teavana set the standard high since that's what we drink at home.  The most interesting part of the coffee buying experience was the conversation I had with the barista. She noticed I had a usaa card and asked how I got on....ok no biggie I'll answer.....my hubby was in the military, but is in school now. Well she goes off and rambles on the pay stipend my husband receives...I felt a little awkward and agree to the number she mentions, ""yea it's something like that.""  Perhaps this coffee shop can assist the baristas in what's acceptable small talk, bringing up pay and whatnot was very uncool esp with customers waiting in line and listening to the barista run her mouth on what my husband receives............",0

Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins Listed in But first, coffee. Good coffee + yummy pastries + plenty of seating = the perfect coffee shop  I've visited their location on 24th a few times but this was my first visit to their original location and wow! I can't believe I've never visited this place before. Parking is pretty convenient since they have their own lot. There are plenty of seats inside, with a good amount of outlets so you can find a lot of people working/studying here.  I always order the Iced Salted Caramel Latte when I visit. They have their drinks in 2 sizes (16 & 24oz.). I also tried their Monkey Muffin which was delicious! It had pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. My friend ordered a Chocolate Chip Latte & a Blueberry Muffin which I really liked as well! The staff were pretty friendly when I had questions about the pastries.  I would definitely re-visit to try their breakfast tacos and their other pastries. We stayed until almost 7 PM on a Monday and a band started playing so you can definitely come here to enjoy a little music as well for a perfect date night.

Coffee Shop 46,"63 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" So I was thinking about doing a list of all the Starbucks in town, which means I would have to bat out a bunch of reviews on the Starbucks I haven't reviewed already, and suddenly that seemed like a lot of repetitive work. So let's talk about Monkey Nest instead.  And I'll make it quick: I'm a fan of Monkey Nest because I'm a fan of Monkey Nest. It's consistent, it's dependable, and I've always found a place to park and sit. Sometimes, that's all I need. And when I think about it, I've done coffee here with just about everyone I know in Austin, at one time or another, and that makes it a little more special to me. I can think of certain people right now, and Monkey Nest will invariably come to mind.    The straight coffee's always been okay, I know nothing about their Monkey latte or Monkey Chai, and they have a real kitchen making real food. I'm kind of fascinated with their giant bowl of boiled eggs and Monkey snacks in the counter display. Lots of cakes & stuff too. I'm pretty sure they also have live music certain nights, but don't quote me, because I'm mainly here in the daytime.  Monkey Nest is apparently doing well, they've just opened a new nest around UT, and I'm genuinely happy for their success. I know there are Monkey deals during Monkey Happy Hour, I just don't know what they are. But I do have a Monkey punch card. It occurs to me this review is a little all over the place, maybe like a bunch of monkeys, um, looking for a nest. Okay, we'll approach this philosophically: Austin is to Monkey Nest, what Life is to - oh, make up your own ending. I gonna go have a coffee moment. Yes, they have highchairs here. Handy for conversing with toddlers. If you're a regular here, they've rearranged the little fireplace/stage area. Disrupts my sense of stability... They make their own breakfast tacos here. The vegan doesn't suck. Central Market is hard to beat though. See all photos from Errol M. for Monkey Nest Coffee",1

Coffee Shop 46,"5 check-ins Monkey Nest is an awesome coffee house, they have delicious organic coffee, they also have a small sandwich menu as well. I have tried a few of the items on the menu and I have never been disappointed. It's also has a lot of seating and a little patio as well. If your looking for a good cup of coffee and maybe a snack as well check this place out! Spicy monkey mocha!!!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"They have, by far, one of the best lattes in town. There's typically always a place to sit for studying and/or getting work done. The music is also very mellow and isn't distracting. I recommend their hazelnut latte. It's always mixed to perfection when I grab one. They have a great selection of foods here, as well. Hearty breakfast tacos and numerous breakfast pastries are the perfect start to anyone's day.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"First time here, and I really enjoyed it. Comfortable and easy-going, like you would expect from a coffee shop. As I waited for my order, I couldn't help but to observe my surroundings. The decor and branding felt so classic-Austin (or at least the Austin/Burnet Road I fell in love with in the first place), versus some of the newer ""cool"" concepts that are just a bit too contrived.  Liked the variety of food and drink options on the menu. And though I came at regular hours, the 24-hour factor is great.  I ordered a regular cup of joe and the Green Friend smoothie with protein. Thought the smoothie was too sweet, like someone dumped Fun Dip in it, but maybe I just ordered wrong. It also took 10 minutes to get the smoothie, which seemed excessive considering I didn't have to wait in line to order and my coffee was given to me immediately.  If I lived closer, I'd probably frequent more often.",1
Coffee Shop 46,This is my morning stop for great coffee and a sweet treat before work. Staff is friendly and attentive.  Very popular and usually packed. Try to go in early or late in the day. Hemp milk mocha with cayenne and cinnamon.,1

Coffee Shop 46,"There are few things harder to screw up than Italian Soda. It's syrup and sparkling water. That's it. But the ""barista"" at Monkey Nest seemed to think it was rocket science because whatever they called ""Italian soda"" was absolutely disgusting. I asked for more syrup, hoping it would fix the issue. Instead, I just got more attitude. I wish I hadn't tipped as well as I did. For 20 bucks for some fruit, a mocha, a yogurt, and a ""Italian soda"" -- it better be awesome.  Husband says the mocha is decent. Fruit was subpar and yogurt was pathetic.  Never coming back here. Austinites, beware.",0
Coffee Shop 46,My stars are 100% about how awesome this place is for nighttime study (after 10pm). I looked for places all over town and won't go anywhere else now.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"This place is awesome! I went there on a date last week. I ordered an iced latte and a sandwich. The sandwich was soooooo good. When my coffee was ready, it was hot. But they made me an iced one right away. They're super friendly and really fast. Will definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"While staying in Austin, my coffee shop of choice has been Monkey Nest, a close facsimile of Starbucks with more personality than the national chain. The apartment I'm renting is literally right behind it, so it's a sweet under one minute commute to get to ""work"". I've enjoyed many a work session here at one of their MANY tables or in one of the comfy chairs by the fireplace. There's even a back room and a quiet nook beside it where you can get away from the louder open room and the barista banter at the counter. Open 24 hours, this place has been busy no matter when I come, morning or afternoon (haven't been here at 2am yet though). No matter how busy they get, there's always plenty of help to keep the line moving and the drinks flowing!",1

(I took off a star for that, because frankly...sometimes I need to procrastinate)",1

Coffee Shop 46,Our first time here. We ordered two lattes. I dont remember the names of the lattes. One of them had chocolate chips and cinnamon. The other one with Cayanne pepper & something else. This one was my favorite. The staff seem to be knowledgeable of their menus. They have plenty of tables to sit down. Mostly students studying which dont bother us cause we're enjoying our cup of lattes. Spicy chocolate chip monkey. Taste cinnamon with cayenne pepper. My fav Chocolate chip monkey,1
Coffee Shop 46,"I met a friend here at her suggestion its a good halfway destination for southies and northies to meet. I really liked my iced coffee  it was a Mocha, with cayenne pepper,  slightly sweet with a great kick from the pepper; and the staff were super friendly and fast. I did not try any of the food but I saw a lot of peeps munching down so I took it as a sign their food must be pretty good. There are plenty of places to sit and for having an awkward layout it still managed to seem bright and open. It this place was a bit further south I would frequent it more bit as is I will definitely be back when I am close by and have a chance to try sone food.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Listed in Thanks a latte! It is always crazy busy in here, no matter what time of day I go in. Luckily their parking extends to the back, I've never had a true problem being able to park, but I have also never been able to get a spot up front. The staff is very friendly and the drinks are delicious. I think what sets this shop apart from the rest for me is the Dolmas platter they have. Delicious and filling at under 5$, its something no other coffee shop has and I'm addicted. I usually get my coffee to-go or am able to sit outside during the cooler months. Inside is difficult to grab and even more difficult when you are with friends. All in all its a great place, but doesn't have me swinging in often.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"For me coffee is worthless during the day. The point of coffee is for solving procrastination issues overnight at your local 24 hour caffeine dealer.  Therefore, I HAD NO IDEA THIS PLACE EXISTED, even though I worked just down the street, UNTIL THEY WENT 24/7 and finally showed up on my ohshitiforgottodothisandneedtopullanallnighteragai­n yelp search.  This place is great, super friendly, just offered me a shot of some Irish frozen thing and I was like ""time to review these fools""  Great joint. Chill. 24 hours. Beans. A couch. Toilets.  At 3:30 am, no complaints. Grateful they're here.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"This place is not consistent. Sometimes they make good coffee, sometimes its worse than staryucks! Today they had the costco caramel tres leches cake in their dessert section, labeled ""locally made"". Kind of deceiving wouldn't you say? What I like the least about this place is their poor Wifi. I've been here 3 times so far over the period of a month trying to get some work done, but the internet is slower than dialup. Whats going for this place is their great location - its always buzzing with the new allandale hipster crowd. If you want coffee that's great every time, there are lots of better more consistent coffee shops nearby.",0
Coffee Shop 46,"3 check-ins I'm always on the search for a coffee shop where I can set up shop to grade papers.  This ideal coffee spot would need to have plenty of seating, plug points, and a friendly staff.  Monkey Nest Coffee certainly meets all of these needs.  Located on Burnett near the AMLI 5350, it's the perfect spot for us non downtown folk to grab an organic cup of joe (although I prefer the Persian iced tea) and have a tasty meal while we work.    Every time I have gone in, I've been greeted by a friendly member of the staff.  If the line is long, I know it won't be a long wait because they are super efficient here.  If I have to wait because they are all out of bacon/egg breakfast tacos (which are delicious!), they always apologize for making me wait.  ""Well worth it"", I say.  I really can't say enough good about this spot!  They even reward regular users with a punch card system; something I haven't seen around for a while.  It's definitely one of the best spots north of downtown to get your coffee fix.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"This is a very good place to study! Not too loud, and not too quiet. The tables are nice and some are actually quite spacious especially in the back room.  When I got there around noon it was so crowded that I could not find a good seat. However after waiting a while I managed to grab a seat by the wall with a plug. In the evening, there were less people and the cafe is just so cute at night!  It is awesome that this place is 24/7 because you don't have to worry about closing time.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Hands down best coffee shop in Austin.  Open 24 hours, food is fantastic, staff is the most pleasant friendly helpful set of hipsters around town.  Great job.  Love this place.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"I had a simple blended vanilla latte, but it was delicious. The place was happenin! Cute decor and great atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Monkey Nest is overall a good coffee shop. Yes I recommend.   The good It has enough seating availabe, free wifi, their walls do have electrical connections to charge electronics,and its open 24hrs according to their sign. The not so good It has pricey drinks and snacks but typical just like anyother coffee shop. Its kind of at 60 degrees F all the time .",1
Coffee Shop 46,"It seems to be almost impossible to find a late night coffee shop with an Internet connection over 3mbs. After calling and asking if there Internet speeds were adequate, fast and reliable. They told me yes it was, so I drive over. It's 1:07am and the shop is light. I connected to the Internet and sure enough, it's not. A lie and a waste of time.",0
Coffee Shop 46,Love the coffee. All organic. The staff is super friendly. One of the best reward programs around. The tea is also great.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"This place had a really awesome vibe when I walked in. There were a lot of different seating options (tables with chairs, sofas, armchairs) so it was great for any occasion you would need when spending time in a coffee shop.  The coffee was pretty good and the music they played fit the mood well without being too overwhelming.  Overall a really chill place!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"I love this place. I have been frequenting monkey nest since before it blew up and became very popular. The owners are very friendly, welcoming and even call me by my first name. The coffee is top notch. The baristas are amazing.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks, awesome staff. It's a must for all those in austin to check out, it will quickly become your new favorite coffee shop",1
Coffee Shop 46,Parking is a nightmare but it's totally worth it. Employees are awesome & the patio is dog friendly. I've never had anything that wasn't super tasty.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"Love studying here. They have plenty of outlets, the chai tea latte is really delicious and I'm addicted to their double chocolate muffin ! It does get crazy packed during midterms and finals , so be careful with that. A few times I almost couldn't find a place to sit .",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Monkey Nest is one of the best coffee shops in town because it has a nice vibe and organic coffee.  It can get crazy during finals week because it's popular with UT students, but otherwise it's quiet and a nice place to catch up on work or Yelp reviews.  ;)  They have unusual selections like Persian tea and various monkey-themed coffee drinks, and they have rotating coffee selections each day.  They recently have started carrying more house-made baked goods, which are a huge improvement over their previous selections.  Parking can be difficult at times, but I have never had to drive away because I couldn't find a spot.  I highly recommend Monkey Nest if you haven't been there before.",1
Coffee Shop 46,Had the latte and chocolate cake! Both tasted great! A little busy when I went but it was a Friday afternoon so that was probably why.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"I frequently meet people here, and it is always a pleasant experience, even though it is usually very busy. Most customers are working quietly on laptops, so really, it's not very loud. Coffee is good; food options are limited, but that's to be expected as it is primarily a coffee place, not a restaurant.",1
Coffee Shop 46,5 check-ins Great coffee and pastries. Alot of seating for studies or work. There is something for everyone. Never had a bad cup of coffee there. The service is great. Great Iced coffee and pastry.,1
Coffee Shop 46,I had their monkey nest sandwhich and it was the bomb! Also had the spicy monkey mocha and it was one of my favorite specialty coffees in Austin. Will definitely be back!,1
Coffee Shop 46,Come here quite a bit for the selection of food and coffee drinks. Still in amazement that the wi-fi is the worst in town for a coffee shop. Sad that I always have to resort to Epoch down the way. PS get your WI-FI upgraded!!!!!!,0
Coffee Shop 46,"This might just be the best coffee in Austin. It is certainly the coolest cafe I've ever been to. They have a full deli for fresh sandwiches served all day, a bakery that rivals places that bake for a living, live music performing weekly and artwork sold from local artists. What's not to like.  I'd highly recommend the Waka Jawaka coffee: black, iced, no sugar. This way you can understand just how good the product is without cream or sugar influencing your decision.  For pastry, please please please try the monkey muffin. It has honey, walnuts, maple syrup and God knows what else.  For the Austinite health freaks...do not fret. They have healthy breakfast options as well as gluten-free and vegan options.  And finally for sandwiches, the chicken pita wrap is all I've tried so far and as far as I'm concerned - that's all I need. It was perfect. Local art made from bottle caps to decorate their sound stage for live music performances.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"The owners of this place are very nice, and the baristas here (unlike many local coffee shops in Austin) are very courteous. They have lots of creative coffee options here, but most of them are very sweet sugary drinks. I got the Honey Luv Latte, which was delicious. Still my favorite is the Spicy Monkey Mocha. They make it with cayenne and it's amazing. If you're only going once, definitely get the spicy mocha.  Overall, good drinks, great place to study or work (lots of tables), and nice staff.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"I love the food they prepare here. I usually get this chicken pita pesto thing (haha, sorry, vague) and their chips and salsa on the side are delicious. Their espresso-based drinks have never been good for me but I like the tea beverages. Parking sucks. I typically go during the day and the service I have received has always been nice.",1
Coffee Shop 46,Schokolade Schimpanse latte is by far the best coffe there!  And how can one forget the 5 ton gorrilla. Awesome pastries and chill atmosphere.,1
Coffee Shop 46,"2 check-ins Love this place, great selections and unique coffees. Smoothies and Teas and great food. What draws me to this place is they are not rude like most coffee shops are. I always feel like an annoyance to most coffee shops for example quacks or epoch (north loop).   So I chose to do my business at a place that is welcoming. Plus they have stamp cards you can fill up and get a free coffee! Cubano Coffee brewed with raw sugar yum!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Great place to study, 24/7 is also great, good for when you want a midnight (or 3 am) snack, love the Honey Luv Latte and the Spicy Monkey Mocha (if you want something 'different')!  Great service with friendly and funny baristas! Would highly recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Great place to get some work done.  Lots of outlets, fast internet and mellow scene.  Had the frozen banana chai and the tuna-feta sandwich both of which were outstanding.  The bathroom is not pristine, but all the other good things about this place make up for that.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"The coffeehouse is one of largest coffee places that I have been. They have a set of commitments that they promise- friendliest, cleanest, & organic high quality. It is spacious with lots of table and the tables are easy to move around for a large group. The service was fast & prompt. Free wifi with no password. Wifi is pretty fast. I was able to use it the whole entire time without getting dropped. They have live music.",1
Coffee Shop 46,"Very fun, very hip, very Austin.  Stopped by the Monkey Nest for some beans (both drip, press) and had a great discussion with barista on her recommendation for each, based on her experience.  While waiting, I slurped down a very satisfying cold press iced coffee (toddy) and wife sipped on one of their wonderful tea options.  In fact, she was remorseful she didn't purchase any to go.  While the hip factor leans more towards the customers vs. the decor, which leans modern/eclectic-ish, it's still a top spot for all types to drink, study, work, whatever.  A fav and a fan.",1
Coffee Shop 46,This place is the best. I went at 4am and still got great customer service. Thumbs up,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Apanas serves some of the best lattes I've ever had. Flavorful and smooth without any syrups or sweeteners. It's that delicious espresso and that creamy milk that they use!  The baristas are friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  Wifi, outlets, and tons of indoor and outdoor seating so it's a great place to get your work done.  They also have beer on tap!  Located on Rock Rose next to a whole bunch of bars and restaurants, so you can also come here after dinner for a post meal treat.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Coffee, beer, wine, juice.... What's more to say?  We had an iced coffee and mocha.  Top notch.  It's a spacious place on the inside with plenty of cool laid back seating. They even had a 'bar' area which was sweet.  Very well worth the trip! (Besides, coffee and beer is always a good combo!) Very sweet place!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Updated reviewThis place is awesome. Great coffee (chai latte specifically is delicious) plus they serve Fricano's deli sandwiches all day! They sell out of the good ones fast so make sure to come early! Nice outdoor seating as well and all the workers are super nice. Love it!  Also love the caramel latte. Divine. Not too sweet. Perfect.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"10 check-ins Great coffee, I just wish it was easier to access. Located in the Rock Rose section of the Domain, parking can be a real pain. Be ready to walk. Lots of room to sit inside, & a small patio great for people watching. Staff is always friendly and fun. I try to make a point to grab coffee here if I'm in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Had a beer and an Americano and the coffee was quite good and flavorful.  I tried a sip of a chai latte and while a bit sweet for me, it was good.   Ambiance is pretty basic and its a decent place to pop in for a drink, or to do some macbook hipstering if that's your thing.   Service was very friendly and eager to please, which was appreciated.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Rock Rose, you're KILLING it. From bars, to food truck evolutions, to quaint coffee shops - Rock Rose Ave at the Domain has something for everyone.  Two Hands is a perfect addition to the area. They are great for a stop-in morning cup of joe, lunch coffee dates, casual beer, or late night espresso. On my Thursday night stop, they had an acoustic set which created the perfect ambience for a post Kung-Fu coffee. (and a truffle, who am I kidding)  Hopefully the barista with the strong southern accent stays around, because he called me ma'am and it was amazing.  You should definitely come here. They've designed their menu and space to maximize the potential for customers at all times during the day. Morning, afternoon or night you can find some reason to stop by Two Hands.

Coffee Shop 3,"Listed in Wi-Fi for Free, Hippies love it!, The Places I Go Out Coffee is in the name, and yes, Apanas (formerly ""Two Hands"") makes a fine array of fair-trade, sustainably grown/harvested caffeine-infused beverages, but I'm impressed with much more about this new spot in my part of town:  Beer. Delicious beer by (mostly) Texas craft brewers. On tap and by the bottle in a rotating selection of brands like South Austin, Founders, Real Ale, Adelbert's, Stone, Breckenridge, Deep Ellum, Odell, Left Hand. Served by a friendly, handsome, Southern gentleman who called me ""Ma'am"" in an alluring way that made me want to order another round. When I expressed curiosity about one of the selections, he immediately produced a sample glass. Swoon.  Wine, for my proper lady friends who don't want to drink delicious beer. There were a few decent choices in red and white, plus a prosecco for my bubbly-lovers.  Price point, not bad at all for the hoity-toity Domain. Coffee drinks range from $2.30 - $3.50, fresh juice blends are $7, beers range from $4-$7. Happy hour from 4-7p with $1 off drafts & wines by the glass :-)  Serving assorted convenience foods from local stars: pastries (by Quack's), breakfast tacos (by Tyson), and sandwiches & salads (by Fricano's).  Bright, modern decor, with tons of natural lighting and plenty of seating for dining, sipping, or even working. There are lots of electrical outlets and I spied quite a few laptops in service during my recent evening visit.  I love that I was able to come in here fresh off a run, a little sweaty & still in my active wear, yet I was welcomed warmly and received great service without anyone batting an eye. I'll be back, hopefully soon.  P.S.

Coffee Shop 3,"3 check-ins Ah, a real deal coffee spot that caters to the real coffee lover and beer connoisseur!  Located in the newer section of the Domain, this place is a nice welcome addition to the area.  They offer the traditionally classic coffee menu with all the drinks you know and love(no frappaccinos here!)  They also have a nice beer selection as well, but with such wonderful coffee aroma in the air the last thing on my mind was beer lol!  I ordered their cappuccino and it was a home run.  Delicious and nutty.. perfectly roasted flavors and tasty frothy foam.  One of the best I've had here in Austin.  They guys behind the counter were really outgoing, energetic and friendly.  They were eager to let us sample some of the drip coffees they had.  I fell in love with their signature roast the most.  Finally my palette is starting to acquire a taste for coffee without all the syrups and creamers and garbage, so I am pretty stoked about buying from places like this.  They also offered the chance to try their beers but after drinking a cappuccino I don't think my stomach would have appreciated it lol!  This will definitely be a go to spot for me besides Red Horn and with great customer service interaction like this,  it's easy to why other locals love this place too.

Coffee Shop 3,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Domainatrix This north Austin Domain complex just gets bigger & better. If I were young & foolish again or temporarily deluded by male menopause, I'd get a very cool dog and move here in a flash. In the meantime, Two Hands and $2.49 will get you a good cup of coffee.  If I were a resident I'd give this place five stars and move on. But since I'm not, I'll tell you parking around here can be a little tricky, and your best bet is one of the nearby parking garages. That's when a casual coffee moment becomes a semi-commitment for me, and unless I'm going to other places at the Domain, I'll have to think about it. This may not be an issue for you.  I was curious about this new Rock Rose district, because I thought everyone was talking about Round Rock. They're not. It's almost like they photoshopped the best & brightest parts of West 6th St. and moved it here, with lots of shiny people and very cool dogs. A great lure to the Domain. And you can get a good cup of coffee. $2.49, their brew, their cup, good stuff.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"4 check-ins Listed in In The Land Of Domania, Life is like a cup of coffee, Rock Rose Ave. I love this new Coffee shop located in the newly opened Rock Rose area! The only thing I can think to improve is more outlets near the bar area, otherwise this coffee shop embodies everything I seek in a coffee shop.  The Goods: - dog friendly patio seating. - fresh juices from locally grown fruits & vegetables that is made to order. - bright open welcoming space optimal for working. - located near restaurants, bars and shops. - free parking garage. - open latish for a coffee shop. - they offer happy hour Monday-Friday from 4pm-7pm. $1 off drafts. Speaking of drafts they have a nice lineup of local taps and a selection of both red & white wine. - they serve mimosas with fresh juices (choice of orange or pineapple). - in addition to coffee prepared tons of ways they of course serve iced and hot teas. They also serve Topo Chico and baked goods from a locally owned Quacks bakery.  If in the Domain this is a nice place to relax, read a book, meet up with friends, get some work done or just unwind with a glass of wine on the patio.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Good playlist, nice ambience, friendly staff, scented bathroom, ample lighting, outlets, and seatings they've got seating outside on a cute patio, seating inside with comfy sofas, intimate tables, and tables that allow you to do work  This place is unreal. It's got the space that none of the other hipster coffee shops can afford, the friendly staff who do not intimidate, furnitures that are not only cute but also great to use (you know those hipster furnitures that hurt your butt and wobble and just never seem to have enough desk space? The ones that probably aren't meant for desk work? Yep. None of that)  The only downs are personal - they're out of my way (perhaps a plus for folks in north Austin) and the latte wasn't as strong as I'd like (though very smooth). Also, not sure if I'm just late to the game at 6pm but they don't seem to have an extensive pastry selection, which can work out to be a pro  alas, I will just have to make another visit to check! :3  I will definitely be back to give the rest of their drink menu a go while enjoying the lovely atmosphere (:  Parking tip- park in the rock rose garage! It's a 5 min walk to the cafe! Or just leave your car in the domain lot and enjoy a nice stroll (:  Did I mention the scented, clean bathroom?! (; #priorities Latte art :3",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Quiet, spacious, plenty of seating (and different seating varieties), outlets, and free wifi! This is a great place to get some work done. I ordered the iced chai latte which was delicious and refreshing. They also have juices, sandwiches, and pastries. Parking is convenient because there's a free parking garage right around the corner behind Mad Greens. The only downside to this place is that it was freezing inside and I wished I'd brought a jacket with me.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"13 check-ins Listed in Grab a Quick Lunch in (or near) the Domain Another great establishment open in the new Rock Rose area of the Domain.  Two Hands Coffee has something to offer at any time of the day.  Most days of the week they are open from around 7-10pm.  In the morning, it could be a fresh blended juice made in house.   Lunch, sandwiches and/or salad by Fricanos Deli with a coffee.  In the afternoon, tea by Mighty Leaf, with a pastry by Quack's.  After work, a local beer on tap or wine by the glass.  The seating area is spacious and bright.  They have a few outside tables to sit at as well.  The seating is comfortable, and with free wifi great for students or those working remotely (no password necessary).    This is the first coffee place that I am aware of in the domain area that specializes in pour overs and organic coffee beans from Nicaragua.  They have a partnership that pays local farmers fairly.  There are two different medium roast coffee beans you can choose from.  One is more fruity, and the other more chocolate and nutty in flavor (El Capitan).  Both are delightful and well done.  They blend the two for the espresso.  The green juice here is legit.  It is definitely heavy on the greens, and not sweetened, just like l like it.  They are working on getting some gluten free pastries, currently they offer a coconut macaroon that is wheat free. It was very filling, and good.  The staff are friendly and do their best to keep up with the orders.  They do also have drip coffee for those that like it the American way. See all photos from Mindy H. for Apanas Coffee & Beer",1
Coffee Shop 3,"7 check-ins Listed in Domain Rock Rose Having walked by Two Hands several times over the last few weeks, we decided to give it a try.    The interior was very open and welcoming with dozens of patrons enjoying the Saturday morning. We had a Chai Latte, Cafe Americano, a pour over coffee, and two pastries.  The Chai was very well executed but lacked character in the chai tea blend used.  Most of the spices were muted with only clove as the dominant flavor.  It wasn't really our cup of tea.  The Americano and pour over were both good, bold, and flavorful.  The high quality of coffee used for both reflected in the final products.  The two pastries we tried were the blueberry scone and banana tea bread - both from Quacks bakery.  The scone was fresh, moist, buttery, and chock full of blueberries.  The banana bread had great flavor but seemed a bit on the dry side.    Overall, this establishment is a great addition to the Domain and the new Rock Rose area providing a nice place to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee. Cafe Americano Chai Latte",1
Coffee Shop 3,"12 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials I had to check out Two Hands as one of the first businesses to open in the Domain's Rock Rose district.  They offer a range of juices, coffee, wine, and beer on tap. I ordered a hot latte, and tried an iced vanilla latte as well. I enjoyed both - definitely one of the best iced vanilla lattes I have tasted! I did ask for my latte in a to-go cup because I like my coffee to stay hot and was not given one, but that's not a big deal.  The location is beautiful inside and out - I love the minimalist interior and the comfortable seating. It definitely would be an awesome place to study or get work done, and there are large windows for a bright atmosphere.  Interesting that the coffee was delivered to our table directly, rather than called out at the bar - I am wondering how this will work during busy hours but it definitely made an impression.  The owner approached us as we left to introduce himself and let us know he was thankful that we dropped by on opening day which was nice. I also read online that Two Hands reserves a percentage of what they spend on coffee to go straight back to the farmers - much respect!  I would come here again to support the business in the future. pastries by Quacks! pretty latte art! Quack's cinnamon roll! yummy See all photos from Hanna J. for Apanas Coffee & Beer",1
Coffee Shop 3,Updated review So having just come back after they renamed themselves I have to say that my experience today was great. Ordered a cortado that not only tasted really good but had a pretty complex tulip on it as well... Definitely will be back whenever I'm nearby. 8 oz. Tulip,1
Coffee Shop 3,"7 check-ins Listed in ATX is where it's AT, Get me some coffee STAT! More and more places opening on rock rose Avenue in the domain.  This is our second trip to two hands and it looks like more people are discovering our little secret! The staff here is very nice and chill.  The pastries come from quacks bakery and are delicious! Today we shared the apple tart which was like a crusty cinnamon roll type dough with fresh sliced apples on top.  Super yummy!  I also had the hand made sugar free vanilla latte.  Also very good!  They have a nice seating area too. They serve different teas, juices and even local craft beer! They also have sandwiches in addition to the pastries,  guess I'll have to keep coming back! Latte love Nice decor!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"3 check-ins ROTD I really like this deceptively lofty coffee shop.  Their space is open and non obtrusive, it's great for a variety of uses.  I've only recently gotten into coffee and was excited to see a glass beaker style brewing setup, sort of like a chemex on their counter tops.  Two Hands Coffee uses top quality coffee that they source personally, they're very excited to talk to you about it!  The coffee prices are fair, they offer beer and wine, fresh pressed juice, and also baked goods from Quack's.  The coffee has rich, slightly acidic flavor, because they really give their coffee time to bloom with the method they're using and the smell in the air is intoxicating.  The caffeine menu is straightforward.  Only one size offered, but with many different creamer choices, including coconut, which I highly recommend if you like coconut flavor and want a nuttier sweetness added to your coffee without the sugar.  If you are persnickety about coffee and near the Domain, Two Hands could not be a better choice.  I rank them amongst my top 5 of Austin coffee shops.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Well, okay, maybe this place deserves five stars. But I've only had one thing on the menu here, so I don't want to get ahead of myself.  I wish Two Hands Coffee was just a little bit closer because I pretty much love it here. The interior is beautiful, spacious, brightly lit, and provides a really welcoming atmosphere with good music softly playing in the background. Good amount of open seats near outlets on a Tuesday evening. The baristas were very friendly--I mean, I didn't talk to them much but sometimes you walk into a place, and you kinda get the wrong vibe, if you know what I mean? Not here. Not even close. And they bring out your drink to you, which is so nice.  They serve a variety of things in addition to coffee: beer, wine, juice, pastries, sandwiches. My classic to-go drink is an iced vanilla latte, which was great (a tad on the sweeter side). I'm looking forward to trying their other items because it's such a great place to study or even just to just grab a cup of coffee (or beer) with your friends.  Also, they have a really cute patio for those who want to bask in good weather.  My only complaint is that if it gets loud, it resonates kind of fast because everything bounces off the concrete floor and wooden panels. Maybe if there were more sound absorbing material somewhere?  Anyway, great coffee, great service, great atmosphere. Will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Listed in 2016 150 new Yelp reviews Great place for a little caffeine, the only reason i'm not giving five stars is they don't do frozen/blended coffee drinks and some people...i'm not mentioning my wife's name...has to have those.  If you're looking for a hot coffee in any shape or form or even iced ones...this is a great place.  Our friend and fellow coffee addict got and enjoyed a latte, it was almost too pretty to desecrate but she drank it anyway, and insisted I try it too, very tasty!  I went with a pour over cup of Finca Los Pinos coffee grown in Matagalpa-Nicaragua, it hit the spot nicely.  We were going to shop some in the Domain, but after a fantastic meal and a great coffee fix at two different coffee shops( you know who had to have a frozen thingy from you know where)....hit a few stores and voted to debark for the better option of a nap....zzzzz courtesy of our friend Rosa See all photos from Tim C. for Apanas Coffee & Beer",1
Coffee Shop 3,I go here occasionally when I'm on this side of the domain. They have great seating options and the employees are always super nice. There is a small cabinet with some pastry selections. They have great coffee options as well. It's a very laid back atmosphere compared to the other coffee shops in the domain.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Great coffee and nice place to either chat with friends ( people still doing that? Haha) or work/study. Great service and atmosphere but mainly, fantastic cortado ( which is my measure of the quality of a coffee shop. Of note I recently tried to order this, in desperation, at a statbucks amd literally could not drink it).",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Very cute and cozy cafe! When I was ordering, I noticed they had a stock of small board games like Cards Against Humanity, which I thought was pretty neat. I came with the intention of studying and was worried I couldn't find a seat next to an outlet for my laptop. I was lucky enough to grab a table right after these two guys got up to leave. I also loved the background music, which was not too loud and consisted of mainly popular indie songs.  If you're looking for a place to chill, chat with friends or do some light studying, Two Hands is great! However, if you're looking to use your laptop, keep in mind that you may not be able to find a table next to an outlet.  I'll probably come back some time! I believe this was a banana nut muffin. Pretty moist and tasty!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"4 check-ins So I don't know much about coffee, but their drip coffee is good enough to drink black. Their beans are fair trade, so that's also a plus if you're into that. They also have a beer and wine selection ($1 off on Mondays-Fridays from 4-7!) The staff are super friendly and keep everything really organized and clean.  I love coming here to study. It's the perfect mix of people who come here to study and socialize so there's always a quiet background buzz. There are big store front windows which let in natural light and makes the place seem very open even when it gets crowded during lunchtime rushes when people swing by to grab a cup of coffee on the go. They also have a small collection of games you can play if you need a study break or just want to play games (bananagrams, jenga, and chess, to name a few). Green tea tropical iced tea",1
Coffee Shop 3,"My go-to coffee place in The Domain.  They have a handsome and helpful staff.  This place is normally pretty damn packed and for good reason.  They have lots of sitting room, free wifi, and everything else you'd need in a coffee shop.  They serve amazing juices which they juice in front of you, try the Rock Rose Hangover Cure!  The music is pretty fantastic as well.  Can I please listen to more Biggie while banging out work on my laptop?",1

Coffee Shop 3,"2 check-ins I don't usually like to give 5 stars but really liking the start to this place!  Friendly counter staff, comfortable varied seating indoors and out.  Looks to possible have semiprivate conference room also.    Oh, main thing very good coffee and varieties at resonable prices.  What else to say, clean, coffee alternative to the area.  Steady flow of people but not crowded.  Lots of outside seating also.  I'm rambling as the coffee is taking effect and the sun is trying to break through the gray sky.

Coffee Shop 3,"I live on rock rose and can barely afford my rent but will always make room in my budget for their coffee.  I have been to quite a few cafes in Austin but I  must admit the caramel lattes here are by far the best I have ever had.  I've never walked away with a cup that I didn't wish was bigger after I finished it.   I must warn you the coffee is quite addicting. If they don't have you hooked by your first cup, a double chocolate chip vegan muffin will be sure to seal the deal. It became mine and several other servers Sunday tradition to grab one before work. Be sure to check in early for one because those fresh baked treats go fast!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Awesome new coffee shop in the Domain! It's a new business, but it doesn't show at all. The space is large, bright, and airy. Generally quiet, so it's the perfect study space, but the noise from few chatty tables seemed to disappear in the space below the tall ceilings. The staff are incredibly cheerful, welcoming, and attentive. They never stop moving, and despite the crowds, they manage to crank out orders quickly and accurately. The coffee itself is sourced directly from Nicaragua, where the owner himself traveled and hand-picked the beans. They also offer a selection of cold-pressed juices and beers. Two Hands is open every day from 8am-8pm, and until 10pm on Tuesday-Sunday.  The food and drink are top notch quality. The staff are wonderful. If you're looking for a quiet and open coffeeshop to study, a small meeting place, or an unassuming beer, this is your place! entrance and front counter of Two Hands, and the owner extra seating and study options in the back of the shop",1
Coffee Shop 3,Overpriced- more expensive than Starbucks unbelievably - for bland espresso. You can do better almost anywhere else,0
Coffee Shop 3,"Looks amazing and smooth tasting!   #cortado. Nice space, friendly staff,  and love the couch! Cortado Heaven",1
Coffee Shop 3,"If you want some real good latte at the Domain, this is the place to go!  And the blueberry scone is worth trying too.. I don't have to go to Starbucks when I come to the Domain!!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Awesome! Every coffee shop should be like this. Quiet, cheap, tasty, good service, beer if you need it, and it isn't full of a bunch of liberal arts undergrads that overestimate thier genius and insight. Highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"My buddy and I have met here twice in the past week to grab coffee and talk. I love the atmosphere of this place! As most have mentioned there is plenty of natural lighting coming in through lots of big windows! There is plenty of seating inside and an outdoor area as well with tables and a wrap around bar that has bar stools. They offer a good selection of wine and beer, and of course coffee! I really enjoy their coffee and will continue to frequent this spot!  Today, we met Amil(spelling?), the owner! He is a very pleasant guy and had plenty to tell us about the coffee and where it comes from. Their espresso is smooth and flavorful and they make all the classic coffee drinks!  Love everything; the beverages, the atmosphere, the location, the design!",1
Coffee Shop 3,7 check-ins Fresh pineapple mimosas? Ya I'm a fan (and for only $7). Besides the alcohol and the awesome space these guys really care about their coffee which makes me feel good about being a patron here. Luckily I live close by and can beat the lunch time crowd. I recommend coming before 11:30 am and you shouldn't have a problem finding a seat or waiting in line. But even during the lunch rush the line moves quickly and there are able bodied baristas behind the counter.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"2 check-ins Great coffee, lovely ambiance, super friendly baristas. Lots of room for lounging, studying, hanging out, etc. They also have food and fresh juice! The shop is spacious and well lit. Will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"This place is awesome! Delicious coffee and beer, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and beautiful atmosphere. They host Geeks Who Drink and comedy nights during the week too. Highly recommend! Check out their new location on South Congress!!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I've started coming here twice a week to study, and really like it. Chill vibe and the drinks are pretty good- a bit pricey for a student's budget, but ethical, so I can deal. I can see myself coming here for awhile! Definitely would recommend if you're in the area. Plan on parking in the garage about two blocks away, fyi. Great place to study. Good music good vibes, decent amount of plugs lol",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Went here for breakfast one Saturday morning about a week after it opened in Rock Rose.  Ordered a pour over and it tasted amazing.  Also ordered pastries, which were great - while not made in house, they bring them in daily from quacks (which is perfectly fine by me).  It was quiet and laid back, but definitely had a steady stream of traffic coming through the door.  I am definitely interested to go back during happy hour (or a more reasonable drinking hour) as they appear to have a nicely curated beer selection as well.  So happy there is a better alternative to Starbucks in the Domain now.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Finally, a quality cup of coffee in North Austin (The Domain).  I had to either go downtown or to Houndstooth (Midtown) to get a decent cup of coffee in this city.    Great staff. Friendly.  Good prices.  Great vibe.  The owner sat and got to know me for 20 minutes while he was super busy.   Definitely a community place.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Goodbye Starbucks; I've moved onto Two Hands. I've been waiting for the Domain to open a local coffee shop, and it's finally here! I came here with my boyfriend on opening day and we were both impressed by their coffee. The baristas were a bit confused when making my latte, but since it was opening day, it was understandable. Their pastries are from a local bakery and super delicious. I grabbed the sugared cinnamon roll and it taste a lot better than Starbucks' variation (morning bun). The only negative was that they didn't have a to-go container. Trying to balance my pastry on a plate while making sure my dog wouldn't pull me was a struggle...",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I love the ambience of this place, background music is not too loud and enjoyable. Plenty of comfortable chairs and desk space for those with laptops. Patio is seating is a plus. They also offer almond as well as soy milk to go with coffee (which tasted great). Impressed. I will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I am a resident at IMT and I like to stop here when I take my pup for a walk. They have poor customer service, boring demeanor, and I feel like the employees may need a few shots of espresso themselves. No energy, or welcoming smile at this place. I have years of retail management experience and this would never fly.  The first time I stepped into the shop a couple weeks ago I was so happy that a coffee shop was so close to my place and I love supporting local! Well.... I peeked my head in to see if it was ok to bring my dog for a short moment to order and go. I saw a woman at a table near the register with hers so I figured it was fine but wanted to keep us by the door so not to disturb people relaxing. The lady's order was called and when she stepped up the cashier told her next time your dog is not allowed. She said ok sorry and went out in the patio to have her drink. I asked her if she minded that I tie mine by the door  and she told me I come here all the time and have never been told that. I went in ordered and left. I returned the next day and walked in with my pup, made him sit next to me by the walk close to the door to be out of the way and we ordered. I asked if it was fine that I order with him and we leave. The guys said, ""yes of course do you want a treat?""  I went in yesterday no problem; stood close to the door and out of the way to order and left with my pup.  Today was not the case. We went to our normal area to order. And stood. No greeting, no I'll be with you in a moment, no acknowledgement. I waited for the cashier to finish his lively convo with someone he knew and waited. Then he took another order from someone wading around the area. And I waited. Then a couple walks in and up the counter and when I thought he would turn to take my order he asked for theirs. They didn't know what they wanted and he waited for them to review the menu. All the while i waited. So I left. Home coffee and Starbucks down the street it is. They have great customer service, coffee ok, they want your money and they want you to return.",0
Coffee Shop 3,"Apanas is definitely my go-to place. Coffee is always tasty, food is fresh, beer choices are eclectic and there are healthy options... Plus, everything is priced really well. The service, though, is why I keep coming back. Every single employee is pleasant and there's a guy named Chris that takes it upon himself to learn the names of customers. I truly believe that his laid back, friendly energy is what contributes to the chill environment and consistent flow of business I see every time I'm there. Oh, and the music is on-point EVERY time.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Wow THC fits right in with the Domain. It's a nice coffee shop in the middle of an otherwise bustling plaza.  Quick tip for parking - go to the garages on the sides of the plaza. I was dumb and spent way too much time than I'd care to admit looking for parking cause I'm too used to Austin's pay-till-you're-broke parking.  The coffee here is on point. I had one of their pourovers, which was extremely smooth, but NOT acidic. I've also heard wonderful things about their latte as well.  My only slight issue is that seating can get limited and lighting is a bit dimmer than I'd like (I'm a student, but the really rare breed that uses many textbooks still...), but it's not like I'm squinting to read.  Definitely check this place out, especially if you'll be in the area for other fun times in the Domain!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I'm not a big fan of the Domain, but the Rock Rose section is ok and this coffee shop is pretty groovy, so I've been a number of times. The baristas have always been friendly and my drinks were good.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Located in the new phase 3 development of the Domain, this coffee shop is a great addition to the shopping center. The Rock Rose area has a different look and atmosphere than the rest of the Domain and Two Hands Coffee is a perfect fit. The ambiance is inviting and the staff is very friendly and helpful. On my first visit two of the staff members introduced themselves and made an effort to get to know me.  Not only is the coffee superb, but they also offer beer and juices. The juices are made on the spot using local fruit and vegetables.  This was the perfect place to get some work done as well. This may change if the place becomes more popular though. If the service and products remain as good as I experienced, there's no doubt that the business will continue to grow.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Really good coffee. We got a cappuccino and a pour over and they were both excellent. Unlike many coffee places that merely go thru the motions, they seem to take great care at pulling their shots, resulting in delicious flavors instead of that burnt nastiness some places expect you to believe is norm. Their cappucino finished with lingering sweetness kind of like maple syrup.  The people were also very friendly. We bought a bag of their Los Pinos coffee beans on the way out. Too bad they didnt have their espresso blend available to purchase but we will just go back again for next time.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"This wonderful little place is a short walk from my job. I braved the cold and wind this morning and walked over and I'm so glad that I did. I love this place!! First, it is nestled in the growing avenue of Rock Rose and I'm so excited to see what else is coming. If the quality and ambiance of Two Hands is any example of what is coming then they are on point 100%.  I decided to order two items just to get a sample of their menu. I ordered a Mixed Greens Juice and a Chai Tea Latte. The Chai is delicious, just the right amount of spice, it was the perfect temperature and blows the socks off any I can remember. The Mixed Greens Juice is really good, really fresh and flavorful.  The prices are not too bad, the Chai was $4 and the Mixed Greens was $7. I noticed that they had a nice offering of salads and sandwiches on their menu. They also offer an assortment of baked goods. Their drinks menu has plenty to choose from and I am excited to keep trying it all out.  The best part for me was the service. The owner and the sweet lady at the counter were both welcoming, friendly and talkative. They made me feel like I wanted to stay and have a chat with them.  Anyone that chooses to go to the Starbucks a few streets over is out of their mind. This place has everything a coffee place could offer. The interior was inviting and well decorated. Nothing about Two Hands feels generic. It is a perfect addition and I can't wait to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 3,What can I say about two hands! It's so BEAUTIFUL. The attention to detail is so thoughtful and the quality of the product is outstanding! Talking with Aamil the owner is so fun he is kind and so knowledgable! He has a passion for his products and even gives back to some of the farmers! He has 6 tap handles of all craft beer and a list of fresh juices which is perfect for someone like me who doesn't love coffee as much as my Boyfriend does! They even have happy hour Monday-Friday -$1.00 draft beer... I'm in heaven! Keep up the great work Two Hands! We will be back :) Beautiful Latte! Owner Aamil. Paradise juice !!,1
Coffee Shop 3,"10 check-ins The Domain in Austin offers a variety of stores to shop, places to eat, and things to do. However, the location does little to offer for coffee other than Starbucks, the Steeping Room and restaurant coffee. Until now  Two Hands Coffee is a coffee shop my girlfriend, who already posted a review that is probably more insightful and enjoyable to read, recommended to me (by that I mean forced to tag along). The shop sits on Rock Rose ave, a hidden road that will be filled with new stores in the Domain. At first glance upon the minimal yet appealing decor, I knew I was in for a treat.  I took my gf and two sisters to try this place out. We ordered two vanilla iced lattes, a special Juice (I forget the name but I remember the price of $7) and a hot latte for about $20, fairly priced! I noticed that their bakery options are from Quacks, which is a local bakery near me that I often enjoy a pie or two. Coffee was good and to everyone's liking, but most importantly the juice apparently made my sister feel healthier within 5 minutes of drinking it. Wow  The vast interior and high ceilings give an open, relaxed vibe to the shop. Order your drinks/food, get handed a number and find a relaxing seat next to their huge window or a nice table with friends and a few minutes later someone will come out and bring your order to you. First time I've experienced this in a coffee shop!  Upon leaving, the manager/owner (i'm not too sure) came up to greet and thank us for our visit! An extremely nice gesture that gave me the extra push to declare this neat coffee shop as my new go-to coffee shop outside of home!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"2 check-ins This is one of my new favorite go-to places in Austin for coffee. Previously known as Two Hands, Apanas is great for coffee and beer/wine drinkers. I especially like that they offer both options because I have a couple of friends that don't drink so this place caters to both of our moods :) They also have juices and pastries as well so it's more than just your typical coffee shop. The vibe is cool and the staff is superb! I've gone on both week nights and weekend nights and have always had a pleasant experience. Sometimes there is a musician playing live music which is always delightful. I highly recommend stopping here. Only downfall is that the close ""15 minute parking"" section isn't always open to the public, and the parking garages are kinda far from the shop itself. So if you plan to stop in ""quick"" to get coffee on-the-go, it may take you about 15 minutes just to find a parking spot and then walk there. Otherwise, I'm still happy to go back. I just need to be sure I have enough time alloted!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Located on the new and up and coming Rock Rose strip in the Domain, this coffee shop would be a nice compliment to the bars and restaurants there if it wasn't lacking so much. I gave this business two stars for their coffee because the coffee itself was about the only enjoyable part of our experience. If you're in the area and need a quick pick-me-up I'd still hit this place up over Starbucks... Unless you're in a hurry. If you are, then just forget it.  The decor is nice, but not quite nice enough for those prime real estate. There just seems to be something missing in the atmosphere. The place just feels a bit dead and the staff didn't seem to add much life into the place either.  My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a shot and were disappointed by the service-time and the staff. After placing your order, they hand you a number so that they can deliver it to your table. We were waiting for what seemed to be much longer than typical for a coffee shop, so I stepped back in from the patio to see if they had forgotten our order. They assured me that they were still working on it... Odd, since we had only seen a couple people in line before us. I went back outside to wait some more... Waiting... Waiting... Finally, I went back inside to see what was taking so long. I asked again where things were at and my question was met with a tone that communicated ""we're working on it you impatient customer,"" to which I asked to speak to the manager. Turns out that was the manager, so I asked him to have a word with me after he finished our drinks. He stepped aside and I explained that we felt we'd been waiting for like 20 minutes... And rather than apologizing for the inconvenience, he stopped me, walked over to the receipt printer and checked the time stamp on our order so that he could challenge me on how long we had actually been waiting. REALLY!?! A customer is upset about how long things are taking and you want to argue with them about details? Wow! Anyways, 10 minutes. That's how long he admitted it had been already... And our drinks still weren't made. I've visited over 30 coffee shops (literally) in Austin and I can't remember it ever taking that long to make a couple of simple espresso drinks, even with a line in front of me. But the bigger issue was the manager's attitude. He proceeded to ask me with an air of condescension if we were in a hurry ""or something."" He explained that they had had a spill, that they could only pull three shots at a time, etc, etc... I wasn't asking for any freebies or handouts, just some respect and an apologetic tone for taking so long. All I felt like I got was defensiveness.  After waiting outside for a few more minutes, we were finally brought our drinks. There was no offer to make things right or a check to see if anything else could be done to ensure our experience was a good one. Needless to say the whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be returning anytime soon.",0
Coffee Shop 3,"Small craft beer selection, and 3/4-sized sandwiches for $9.00 that I saw you pull pre-made from a fridge?  Epic fail.  My only conclusion is that your target market consists of people with more money than sense.",0
Coffee Shop 3,I live in the domain so it's such a short walk to grab some of the best coffee. Management and staff are very kind. They even offer beer and wine for those evenings when needed. Hazelnut latte,1
Coffee Shop 3,My favorite coffee shop in the domain area. I go there every week to hanging out with my friends. Loved it!!!,1
Coffee Shop 3,Great outdoor environment and lots of seats available. We love its location - close to Domain but still distant away from crowds. Their drip coffee taste good.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Very nice coffee lounge with lots of natural light. This place gets a five star because of its great options. Fantastic coffee, tea, bear, FRESH JUICE, pastries and breakfast tacos. Fun and friendly shop.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"4 check-ins Really great coffee.. I tried their drip and their hazelnut latte and overall the coffee hits the right spot. So as a coffee house it does what it's supposed to do !  As much as I wanted to i could not take away two stars (felt really mean to do that ) for two major faults (one because of the location and two, well.. )  1. Parking is a nightmare if you plan to come here during weekends. This Is because of the location,I understand so I did not take away the star. Haven't been here during weekdays so don't know how the situation is then.  2. INTERNET connection issues.. now a days coffee shops have become more of a working spots than just coffee drinking spot.. and it feels that their Internet just poops out if there are too many people in the spot. I hope they can fix that coz this is a really good spot to come and work as well as relax !",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Y'all! This place was great. All baristas were soo friendly. Pastries and drinks were spot on! There's wifi and plenty of cozy spots to get homework done. The background music is a bit loud, but if you can handle that then you can get much studying done!",1
Coffee Shop 3,I thought I would never find better coffee than my many trips to Brazil. I was wrong. This is Righteous Coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Great coffee, service, and atmosphere! Great addition to the Rock Rose family! It's a really spacious place good for working during the day or grabbing a quick coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"This place has a wonderful ambiance, not to  mention excellent coffee and juices! The staff was super friendly and attentive. It is right next to the new Tarka in the Domain.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Very friendly and two hands down, the best coffee in the area. My family enjoys coming here severs times a week",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Best place to get some work done at the Domain. Located in the new Rock Rose area of the Domain, they offer Quack's pastries and are always very friendly. Not to mention the coffee and espresso drinks are amazing. They always have 2 types of drip coffee and multiple pour over varieties.  The entire staff is always friendly and knowledgeable with all of their offerings.  They also have beer on draft and hot sandwiches, but I've never had them before.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I am their biggest fan of both the coffee and the juice. I'm talking about freshly made juice that lucky for me is heavy handed on the veggies instead of just being full of sugar.  Do yourself a favor and order yourself a Mighty Greens. Their coffee is just simply delicious. No bitterness ever. One day I will move past their caramel lattes to try something else like the excellent pour over coffee that everyone raves about, but for now I'm happy with my lattes. Aamil the owner is such a pro when it comes to hospitality.  You can tell he cares and you'll usually see him working his butt off and interacting with customers.  You won't find any cranky too cool for school baristas working here.  The staff is nothing short of amazing.  Everyone is really approachable and will offer suggestions.   They also have had live music here twice in the evenings and both artists have been excellent.  Hopefully trivia nights will be coming in the future.",1
Coffee Shop 3,First visit here. Love the pace and ambient music style. Ice tea was my choice so good so far. Serve staff were solid and pleasant. It appears locals would love to have this place.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"I love this place. The coffee is fantastic and everyone is really nice. They also serve juice and beer so they have something for everyone, yet still able to maintain an identity. Great place!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Great place to work! Love their coffee, friendly service, fast internet, good lighting. I okay hesitate to write this review because I don't want it to get too packed! ;)",1
Coffee Shop 3,2 check-ins Nice new spot with good pour over coffee and food.  Serve local beer and wine too.  coffee is all fair trade and they have sandwiches and pastries too.   Park in the garage and walk over if you're visiting the domain. Bar area,1
Coffee Shop 3,Hands down the best coffee I've ever had. I never knew coffee could have so much flavor! Extremely friendly and knowledgable staff. A comfortable place to spend the day. My new go-to coffee shop!,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Ive stopped by here a couple times over the last few weeks. I can see parking being an issue, but both times, I stopped by around 8AM, so I was able to park right out front. Very clean and inviting space.  The baristas have been very friendly both times I went.  Its in the Domain, which is one of my least favorite places in the world to go, but its in the new Rock Rose section of the Domain, which is a little more tolerable.  That said, its relatively close to my house....  Ive ordered pourovers both times and theyre ok. Their coffee isnt great, but its certainly above average and they have the best beans you can get north of 2222 (where you can get Wild Gift at Thunderbird).  Their beer taplist looks to have a pretty solid selection. I didnt try any of their espresso-based drinks or pastries.    Definitely a solid choice if youre looking for good coffee in north Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 3,Loved this place. Visiting a friend and wanted to try some local coffee. Super friendly staff and the coffee was awesome. Loved my mocha latte. My friends got chai lattes and said they were a little milky but good.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Great coffee shop, really enjoyed my time here. Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxing.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I have struggled to find good coffee around where I stay, which is 25 min North of downtown. Life is really hard without access to good coffee, especially that I sometimes work from home. All the highly rated cafes around my place were all disappointments.  Guess suburb population tends to appreciate yummy sugary coffee flavored milkshake way more than real coffee.  In Austin, Houndstooth was my favorite , but a bit far from mine and it's N. Lamar location does not have enough tables for work. I am so please to find Two Hands, and now I go there every weekend for work, even though it still takes me 15 minutes to get there. The coffee is spot on. The cappuccino and expresso macchiato are both well made, with the right temperature and good quality beans, allowing the expresso taste shine through the foaming milk. Nice staff. Yummy pastry. (Macaroon is my fav! Ask them to heat up!) good space for work.",1
Coffee Shop 3,it is very good  the coffee is very good my dad got the drip coffee with vanilla added. and we both got the banana nut bread very tasty and the staff was nice and friendly and a convenient location,1
Coffee Shop 3,"I love this little coffee stop. It's just around the corner from my apartment (win #1) the coffee is delicious (win #2) and the employees are super pleasant to be around (win #3.) Check it out, have a cup of something, or a little bite to eat, and relax.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Best coffee in North Austin! Pour overs, espresso drinks, delicious juice and BEER! 6 taps.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"2 check-ins Amazing place!! Until they opened, I cannot say I had found a local coffee shop in my neighborhood (North Austin) that was not a Starbucks. Great atmosphere and I especially love that they acknowledge their customers: they recognize you and actually check up on you. I also love that they have a quiet area with no speakers, something other places definitely lack. A great place to get a good cup of coffee (they have great almond milk lattes!!) and get work done or have a conversation with a friend without the need to yell. I also appreciate that their coffee is fair trade and that they recycle! No Styrofoam here!! I have definitely found my local coffee shop!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Great environment. Pour over is out of world. Staffs are awesome. Fresh juuce is one of the best in area. They have 6 tap draft beer. Pastries from Quack bakery is amazing Great pour over coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Stopped in yesterday for the first time-- Best pour-over coffee I've had!  Also enjoyed a Salty Oat cookie from Quack's bakery in Hyde Park (central Austin), which nearly made me cry with nostalgia, since I used to live two blocks south of Quacks, and have loved those cookies for 15 years (but haven't had one in 10 years...).  Two Hands has a really nice open and light atmosphere with lots of comfortable seating.  Its welcoming and warm without being a dark noisy cave like the big-chain coffee house we all know about...  I'll definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Good coffee options. Clean, with lots of light, good windows, nothing cramped or dark about it. Only been once, for a pour-over. Better experience all around than Starbucks. Reasonable price. Good flavour to the coffee (bright, citrusy). Good body. And nice arms. If you know what I mean.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Awesome coffee and awesome vibe! They have a little nook in the corner for ""quiet study"" and there are plenty of outlets there. Definitely worth checking out!",1
Coffee Shop 3,coffee is to die for and the ambiance is just my style,1
Coffee Shop 3,"This place is my new living room. Amazing coffee, great beers on draft, even fresh juices. The staff is super friendly and the room somehow feels spacious and cozy at the same time. Just a perfect blend of everything you could want in a coffee shop.",1
Coffee Shop 3,First to Review Great environment with great coffee! Two hands is simple and inviting! I can't wait to study here! What else can you ask for?,1
Coffee Shop 3,Pretty good coffee at a location that's convenient to me. The deal breaker though is that you can't connect to Wifi with your company laptop. I came here on a Sunday afternoon an hour and half before my yoga class at Corepower Yoga across the street. Brought my work laptop thinking I could do some work before the yoga class. I spent 10 mins trying to connect to their wifi and eventually gave up and asked for help. The guy at the counter asked if I was using a company laptop. Apparently they've been having this problem for a while. I've never encountered this at other coffee shops before. I guess I won't return until they fix this problem.,0
Coffee Shop 3,"I just moved into an apartment in the domain and checked out this coffee shop today. It is on a street with lots of bars so I did not know quite what to expect. The atmosphere is chill and they have coffee, sandwiches, beer and wine. It was a good spot to sip some wine and read my kindle. I had no issues with thr wifi. I will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 3,This place is perfect for studying or reading during the week.  Very laid back feel.  The owner is always there and he is very amiable. My fiance and I are regular coffee drinkers that used to go to Starbucks twice a week but now go almost exclusively to Two Hands.  We usually get lattes which are amazing but they have a great beer selection as well.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Best cup of coffee in town. Aamil and the baristas there are not only hospitable, but they take the time to get to know you; they are passionate about coffee as well. Great atmosphere -- somewhere you can spend hours and feel at home.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"I love the coffee here. These folks have a real relationship with the farmers in Nicaragua.   The flavor is exceptional and the atmosphere is sedate and relaxing. Did I mention...Good Coffee!!  Stop by for a cup, you'll love it too.",1

Coffee Shop 13,"11 check-ins This is a locally owned Austin business and for that reason alone you should check it out.  Naiman and his staff serve up awesome coffee and tea drinks that can be ordered hot or cold.  My personal favorite is the Luna (Coffee with Mexican Chocolate) topped with whipped cream.    They have a funky decor and have paintings and artwork hanging up to enjoy and purchase which are all done my local Austin artists.  In addition to drinks they offer breakfast tacos, sandwiches, cookies, bagels and other treats.    Check in on Yelp for 10% off your order.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"I will start with the things that were good.  The space was nice and cozy, there is nice art on the walls and the service is great.  I didn't have a hard time parking and there was only a 3 minute wait to order my food.  Full disclosure, I didn't come here for coffee.  I came here to grab a quick lunch and work for about an hour.  I grabbed a caprese sandwich and the lemon lime ginger echinacea soda.  Unfortunately they were both awful.  I really wanted to like them  I was really hungry and this set me back $13 with tax & tip.  But the sandwich had just been pulled out of the fridge and was a half sandwich- for $7.50, you can just give me the whole thing.  But really it would have just been a whole sandwich of sad.  There was no flavor and the bread had been soaked through in places so the texture was gross.  Luckily it came with a bag of chips which was definitely the best part of my meal.  Then I tried to wash the chips down with some of the soda and it was so disappointing!  It was over carbonated, and also has little flavor.  Maybe they forgot to add sugar to it? I'm not sure.  Anyway, maybe just come here for the coffee and don't stay for the food?",0
Coffee Shop 13,Cute neighborhood book with good coffee and local snacks from some of your favorites-- including a small selection of Fricanos sandwiches. Happy to see a lot of of local charm on this busy fast food dominated corridor. I look forward to much more character coming to this failsafe flipping and investing part of town.,1
Coffee Shop 13,Great little coffee shop. I found it on my way to a professional development class at the Embassy Suites on 35 frontage. This will be a regular stop for me if I take more classes up this way.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"4 check-ins ROTD Ok, this is the most authentic, anti-corporate, true coffee shop I have ever been to.  Naimen is the owner/operator and the most knowledgeable person on coffee I have ever met.  If this isn't obvious in the craftsmanship he applies to his trade, then you aren't a true coffee fan. If you continue to visit and listen to his coffee conversations, you can't help but learn a ton.    Now for the coffee...I am a traditional coffee person.   I like my coffee black, no cream, no sugar; so yes, I am boring.   I find those that order their triple half-caff double Chia latte with cinnamon revolting people that talk more about themselves, the Kardashians, vaccinations and whatever other mindless nonsensical fad happens to be popular.  You can find these people at the green and white place happily displaying their latest technology as a status symbol, but I digress.    I was so impressed with Naiman's knowledge I threw caution to the wind and left my coffee experience in his hands.  He had no clue that I liked my coffee plain Jane with the only question being ""whole milk?"", to which I said ""yes.""   After the typical slam bang of the espresso machine I was presented with the non-descript white cup with the to-go lid in place.  I didn't care to take the lid off top to see what was inside as the first sip would tell me more than any visual.  As I take that first sip, he asks, ""So?""  My mind is now seriously confused.   I detected a bit of mocha but the strength of the espresso bean and the silky smooth sensation of real whole milk froth.   I ponder the fact that I like this; no, I REALLY like this.  My response is a guarded one of ""Café Mocha but there is something strange and delicious."" His response startled me.  Naimen revels to my shock and horror that I just had a ""BLACKBERRY LATTE!""  I think to myself, how can this be?  I am a normal blue collar coffee type!  I am not a one bite fruit guy.  I love my droid and my Linux and my old school punk and all things anti-latte, yet I somehow love this blend.   The elegance of the blackberry syrup made and espresso bean creating a slight hint of Mocha combined with the smoothness of whole milk is a testament to molecular gastronomy.  I have now come to the conclusion that as long as a craftsmen is true to their craft, I can respect that.  I can not only respect it, I can admire it.  Corona Café is a true rarity and certainly respects that art of coffee brewing and blending.   While the green and whites are painting by number, Naimen is a true artist.

Coffee Shop 13,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016, Austin Spots Really like the vibe here. Immediately liked the owner as he was polite, positive, and very knowledgable about his craft. He's like a mixologist with coffee. He was training a new barista when I arrived so I got the pleasure to hear him talk a bit about the chemistry of the decisions he was making while brewing.  Ordered the Blackberry Dark Mocha and holy crap, one of the best coffees I've had. Not too sweet with lots of flavor. Most coffee shops cover up the lack of complexity in their coffee drinks with more sugar, which I hate.  Wish I was living in Austin again to hit this place up every day. Come here and you won't be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 13,This guy knows his stuff. I love that they offer a wide variety of ad ins and the different types of milk (ie: almond milk etc.) I had the Apollo (blackberry orange dark chocolate mocha) Delicious! Husband had the cinnamon cappuccino which was also super yummy! Try this place out! Going back tomorrow,1
Coffee Shop 13,"I came here because of the good reviews on yelp. I'm always in the area and I'm starting to realize how overrated Starbucks can be. So I decided to give this little place a try. I was not disappointed. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. I already knew what I wanted, the orange dark chocolate mocha but still took a look in the menu to confirm the name of the drink. It's called JUPITER. It's pretty cool, the whole menu is based on planets and solar system. My drink was delicious!! I paid $5.50 for a medium size. The owner introduced himself and he seemed to really put a lot of attention and he made sure the drink was made to perfection. He told me, ""I hope you love it"" and went on to tell me how everything is made by him, the process of the orange syrup and all. I was defiantly impressed! I will defiantly be back!!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Listed in Lunch Austin!, Four Star+ Coffee I'm writing this as I sip on some kind of magic latte that Naiman created for me after I dragged my haggard behind into Corona for some caffeine. (Normally I get a chlorophyll and green tea latte with almond milk, but today called for some extra oomph. I was clearly not disappointed.) As he described it, it tastes exactly like gingerbread. I agree, but it's 800x better than any gingerbread I've ever had. He also said, ""It's sometimes just really nice to have the time to make something special for someone."" Can it get better than that? Can it?!  Some other bright spots about Corona: they make a lot of their own flavors from scratch (the blackberry syrup is fantastic, and so is the long-brewed cinnamon/clove tea). (Edit: I previously thought they roast their own beans...someone who doesn't work there told me that! See Naiman's comment below. Does not change my opinion.) I found out today that the condensed milk is handmade. A lot of the baked goods are as well. They serve sandwiches from Fricano's that are delicious.  I highly recommend Corona to literally anyone with tastebuds. Just go.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"This is my new go-to coffee stop! Awesome cold brew with many choices for flavors (if you're into that like me.) I suggest cold brew with dark chocolate mocha and blackberry - yum. The owner is super cool and interesting to talk to. A great spot for a variety of coffee drinks and studying. Dark chocolate mocha + blackberry flavored cold brew. Very fresh, flavorful, and not too sweet.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"I simply love their innovative coffee and beverage inventions!  Small, not a lot of outlets, but the owners/baristas are so welcoming! Spicy Mexican Mocha latte! Not sweet and not a lot of cayenne, just like I like it!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Laidback unpretensious coffee shop. Worth the stop for coffee, very limited food choices.",1
Coffee Shop 13,I was nervous about an important meeting when I tried this place out for the first time.  I walked in frazzled and walked out with a smile on my face.  The guy who took my order was genuinely friendly. I tried the Luna Mocha and it was delicious. Seriously made my day.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Updated review I'm not really a coffee person, but I may have a new spot... I came thru and got myself a delicious chai tea latte (Really one of the best I've ever had! Not too spicy and you could taste the saffron.) and Naiman was so nice. I had never come here before and he gave me free almond milk. Will definitely be coming back!! Thanks for making me less sleepy!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Best coffee in Austin, amazing homemade syrups and nice pre-made sandwiches to go.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"I never review anything unless it's really bad, but Naiman was so nice that I had to contribute positively. He told me that he hopes that I love my iced chai latte, which he made from scratch. Restroom smells great too.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is located in a small strip mall in a run down area. When you walk it, complete 180. Fun, vibing place with an extremely friendly barista/owner. My wife and I went with the Blackberry Dark Mocha - drink was real smooth with no syrup bite which is huge for me. Subtle berry tons with creamy follow through. Highly recommend this place, it is worth a 10-15 min detour if you are located on the west side of town.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Love this place! Great coffee and food, and the owner is awesome. It's obvious that he puts a lot of thought and has a ton of knowledge about what he serves, which I really appreciate. Also, it seems like everyone who goes here is a regular customer, which is a great sign.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Just happened upon this little gem in a north Austin strip mall neighborhood. The coffee was good but the guy working the counter was delightful. Very nice and answered all our questions. The clientele is varied from in and outlets to stay and read the newspaper. He greeted everyone as if they were family. I will for sure be back. I dig the vibe. Finally something other than fast food, liquor stores, or pawn shops in the hood.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Small, minimal, and cozy. Great coffee. The inside atmosphere is on the darker side, free wifi, and a small place to sit outside. Very knowledgable owner.",1
Coffee Shop 13,2 check-ins Brilliant. She was so helpful and kind to us- we had never been before. We all were pretty adventurous and we tried each others drinks and every single one was gorgeous tasting. Super tiny but well -maintained and used space. Could be dark but the walls are bright and the atmosphere very calm and welcoming. We are from out of town but we will definitely be returning before our drive home!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Best coffee in town. Also excellent limeades, teas, horchata, etc. Pretty much anything they make themselves is fantastic, and they do make a lot themselves.",1
Coffee Shop 13,This place had incredible coffee and you couldn't ask for nicer service! I had a blackberry-lavender latte (the Blue Moon) and it was so good I wanted to marry it -- not too sweet and the coffee itself had a great flavor. I'd come here every day if I lived in Austin! A Blue Moon latte: blueberry and French lavender,1
Coffee Shop 13,Some of the best coffee in town. The Half Moon is my favorite. The staff is friendly and the prices are cheaper than the chains that serve warm sludge. All the ingredients are flavorful and amazing.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Found a new coffee spot! This joint is about 5 miles from where my guy lives--it's worth the short drive for us. We came in on a Sunday around 1p for our first dose of caffeine and were not disappointed. The barista was a female with a calm, courteous, and just straight up 'good-people' demeanor: awesome! There was a short wait when we came in--no biggie! It's a smaller coffee shop with a single person on staff taking orders and making the drinks. The actual beverage I got was super tasty--I could still discern the flavor of the roasted espresso and it wasn't overwhelmed by the soy or syrup.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Blackberry Pleiades awesome, strong wifi, intimate setting, clean ( gender neutral) bano, cute knick-knacks 4 sale, local bakery treats/snacks, comfy chairs...random location tho",1
Coffee Shop 13,This is my first Yelp review... I had the harvest moon latte and it was hands down the best latte I've ever had. Each latte takes a few minutes to make because of the care they take into making it. So make sure you have some time to go in and order to enjoy this delicious cup of joe. The staff was very nice. My friend had the blackberry latte (aka half moon) which was also amazing. Highly recommend!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"I read the reviews and made the long trek from SW Austin...This was a tiny hole in the wall place, with Austin charm. The staff was very friendly welcoming and nice...the $6.00 green tea chi late was not so great tasted very watered down..but others say it has been great. Best thing was that staff was nice.",0
Coffee Shop 13,"I just moved to the area and figured that I would take some visiting friends with me on my first trip to check this place out.  In short? We love this cafe.  It's intimate, not Starbucks-busy, and within walking distance. One friend ordered the house-developed green tea chai. The owner even took the time to describe the flavors with which he crafted this chai. (It's worth noting that the owner appeared to be pretty down-to-earth with no hint of pretentiousness, which is very welcome for an indie cafe!)  New favorite local coffee shop, hands-down.",1
Coffee Shop 13,Great coffee. Love this place. I definitely recommend coming here for a cup of coffee and wonderful service.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"This coffee shop is comfortable with a homey yet cool atmosphere, and of course, the specialty lattes are delicious! They have unique flavors such as pink Tibetan salt that pair wonderfully with their smooth, delicious coffee. They also sell Taco Mex breakfast tacos, the best in town. This place is truly a hidden gem, highly recommended.",1
Coffee Shop 13,This is my favorite coffee spot in all of Austin! The owners really know what they are doing and are super nice. I drive 20 mins just because I crave their iced lattes!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"This was a recommended casual meeting place and I could not have been more impressed.  If you want to support local, drop into Corona Cafe and order anything. Friendly service. Fantastic vibe. Tasty drinks.  I had an Orange Infused Dark Chocolate Mocha on recommendation and I am craving another one now.  Yay Austin establishments! This is a one of a kind drink, perfected after two years by the owner, called an Orange Infused Dark Chocolate Mocha.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"It's called Corona Coffee Co., because those who run it are shining stars of the local community. They choose to use only the freshest of locally sourced good - to create some of the most delicious, delectable and amazing drinks, snacks and meals around Austin. A true diamond in the rough; Corona Cafe will continue to excel as a place where the customer comes first and freshness is guaranteed.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Love this place! Came here on my first day of my Austin trip, and will be coming back every day to get me going. I was warmly greeted and quickly became friendly with Naiman, Bridget, and Dabne. Absolutely feels like your friends' place, making you drinks!  That said, if you want to study/work, and not chat with people, you should probably bring headphones. Obviously I like the community and conversation.  I recommend the green tea chai latte, and one of their specialties, the Harvest Moon-- honey hazelnut latte. But all of their specialty drinks sound divine!  Food wise, they stock lots of yummy local muffins, sandwiches, burritos, etc. I loved their tomato-mozzarella sandwich, but I hear their breakfast tacos are rad. Gonna have to get one tomorrow.  If you're looking for good drinks, friends, and ambience, I can't recommend this place more! :)",1
Coffee Shop 13,Vanilla team soda tastes yummy! I will come back just for the drink. The sandwiches are okay. I won't get them again though.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"I have been to pretty much every locally owned coffee shop in Austin, and this one definitely exceeds my usual expectations by a long shot. All of their flavors and syrups are made by them, and they are really amazing flavors, like blackberry and lavender. I had the blackberry white mocha and my sister had the salted caramel latte/mocha (I forget which!). Both were really, really delicious. I like coffee drinks that don't have an overpowering taste of coffee, and are more flavorful than outright sweet. The drinks weren't just loaded with sugar, but carefully made to taste delicious and refreshing. I seriously cannot wait to go back. It's a tiny little place in a small shopping center, so parking could definitely be an issue, but there were tons of spot on the late weekday afternoon I went. Thanks to the barista for being so great as well!  Oh, and their muffins are really good. I'm not sure if they were homemade or vegan, but they tasted like they were both. Yum! Beware, they close at 5pm on weekdays.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"7 check-ins Quaint locally owned coffee shop.  I never would have thought it was here but for randomly seeing it when my husband and I spontaneously decided to drive around the surrounding neighborhood about a month ago.  We wanted to check it out, but it was closed at the time.    I had an early morning meeting today and decided to stop by after.   The staff is super friendly and helpful.  I had the iced Luna, and it was perfection.  Also had some breakfast tacos which are from Tex Mex off of Manor.  I absolutely loved the black bean, egg, and cactus taco.  Will need to check them out with the hubby sometime.    I have been frequenting the Star Bucks off Barbara Jordan (Mueller Area) for sometime now, but with this place just a few blocks away from there, I think I found a new morning spot.  They were not too busy, so it was easy to find a table and there are plenty of outlets for you to charge your phones, laptops, and other devices. I definitely would recommend this place and encourage you to GO LOCAL. They close at 3, so Star Bucks may keep my loyalty in the evenings. See all photos from Renee D. for Corona Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 13,"3 check-ins I consider myself a cold brew connoisseur.  This place is consistently the best.  The pastries are really good too. The people that work here are always great and I like the atmosphere. It's a smaller space, but I like it that way.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"I just discovered Corona Cafe and I wish I had found it sooner!  I live close by but discovered it by chance when traffic was particularly backed up and I hadn't taken the time to make coffee at home. It's tucked away on a side street off of Cameron Road in a nondescript row of businesses, perfect for the neighborhood.  The vibe is wonderful and everyone there is friendly! I talked to the barista and two costumers as my order was taken and felt genuinely welcomed. The shop has an authenticity about it that's refreshing.  I've only gotten their drip coffee (super affordable, flat $2 for a good sized cup) and a tasty almond poppyseed muffin, but both were worth the price. Based on other people's reviews I'd like to try some other drinks rather than my usual drip coffee. I will definitely be making more coffee pit stops here!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"This is a cute little coffee shop just off Cameron Road close to The Nomad.  I'm a daily brew gal for the most part, and when I'm super fancy I go for an Americano--- no room for cream necessary.  In a pinch I will drink just about any coffee, but I typically stick to the good stuff.  I consider this place some of the good stuff.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"3 check-ins Ok, so the first time I came here I just dropped in to grab a cup of coffee and something with espresso for my best friend's drive back home from Austin.  I wasn't really planning on being a fan of this place, but then we walked in, loved the vibe and both of us were almost immediately talked into trying the horchata with espresso (which, might I add, didn't take much convincing). The horchata is made in house with almond milk and is the bees knees. Ask for a sample!  Naiman (sp?), the owner, is awesome and makes tons of stuff in house from scratch - anything from syrups to horchata! They're the ""Corona"" items on the menu, you'll notice them for the creativity.  So, now that I've been a few times I can definitely say I'm hooked on two things: 1) Horchatte and 2) double brewed green tea w/ chlorophyll.  Try them. And all the other drinks because I'm sure they're great! Just wish they had better food options.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Dude. I can't even.  This place is really amazing. Atmosphere, Drinks (Best Cold Brew in town, hands down), Tacos, Staff. All A+++. Family owned and run, this neighborhood shop has got your favorite chain beat. Just try it once, you'll be amazed.  Atmosphere: It's hidden in a small strip mall, and if you blink you'll miss it. So, don't blink because its totally worth it. Inside is warm and cozy, and always has great music on. There is also a selection of local handmade hats, scarves and jewelry. Yeah, that's right. The noise level is usually pretty quite, with occasional crowds that make it get to the average level, but there always a few people working on their laptops so the noise level stays pretty low.  Drinks: So this is where they really shine and what ultimately drew me in as a regular. The cold brew here is stunning, and it takes a lot to impress me. I've driven all over this town and tried everyone's cold brew. Then I found Corona, and it changed my life. I know that sounds dramatic, and it is. But it's also true. Talking with the management about their approach to coffee, it becomes quite clear that they take this sh*t seriously! Their knowledge and skills are unparalleled. Other than the cold brew, they have a whole assortment of gourmet drinks. And I mean, Gour-freaking-met! The Pulsar (caramel mocha with himalayan salt) is my favorite. But the Corona Borealis (Kashmiri green tea chai latte topped with fresh saffron, cardamom and cinnamon) is my other favorite. Freaking Saffron!  Tacos: They carry Taco-Mex tacos. The migas is delicious, but the egg, cactus and black bean is also very popular. The spicy green salsa is creamy and delicious!  Staff: They are all so knowledgeable and friendly. This family establishment really cares about their customers and you will see it in the numerous regulars that come and go all day. I always have a great time when I come here. Which is about four times a week. Check it out.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Excellent beverages, comfortable space, excellent service.  I ordered an earl grey tea, and there was plenty of bold bergamot flavor - good stuff. The owner personally introduced himself with a smile, and was very friendly.  Good study/workspace - the environment is peaceful without feeling sleepy.  Overall, a great experience. I'll be back soon.",1
Coffee Shop 13,They have the best espresso in Austin! Very good customer service as well!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"I really like Corona Cafe. At first their coffee menu confused me a little. They have excellent espresso and an even more excellent friendly barista. They have a good range of snacks and breakfasty foods but I haven't tried any except a chocolate muffin. It's huge for the price.  I wouldn't come here for a quiet study place though, seats are limited and there's always music blaring.",1
Coffee Shop 13,amazing location -- i will be back! we had an utterly delightful time here. tiny saffron petals on top of the chai. handmade orange syrup for orange hot chocolate. the proprietor was full of light and love. nothing could have been better!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"The vibe is so chill here, I'm thinking I'll bring my pillow next time and have a nap.  Good coffee, quality sandwiches. Not a huge menu, but they make what they got count. I've heard good things about their breakfast tacos, but they were sold out when I went. But hey, it was noon already, so that's on me.  The husband/wife owners have created a cool, little spot here in a not so cool strip mall. This corner is kinda beat down. But you get inside the cafe and all is warm and cozy. The husband works the counter and makes you feel like you just walked into your own kitchen and he's there to fix you something to eat and drink.  Cool-ass place!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"13 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", ""These are my 'Coolest' reviews?"" Hmmm... Let me tell you what this place is not:  1.  It's not your mama's coffeehouse. 2.  It's not Breakfast at Tiffany's. 3.  If this is your hood, it could very well be the best part of waking up, without Folgers in your cup.  Second, you need to know the family that runs this place keeps it open from 7am to 3pm, Monday through Friday. And that's it. This is somewhat unique because:  A) They like spending their time doing family stuff together, rather than increasing business revenue. B)  It's a happy family. You'll know it when you chat with them. C)  I'm not sure how far the ""Family First"" concept flies these days at Wharton.  Yes, it probably gets backed up here during a typical morning rush, and they're always tweaking stuff like menu items and pre-packaged brown bag fare for you to carryout quickly. But if you do have a little time, consider stopping in here for a moment or two: I'm simply fascinated with people who run a business and do what they do because by gosh and golly, it's exactly what they want to do, and not just another job or something else in life to complain about.  I had originally planned to give Corona Café four-stars for being what they are - an unexpected gem of a coffeehouse hidden in a strip mall. That in itself makes them special. But it occurred to me, as I was hanging there on a Monday afternoon with an Americano and chatting about families and business and stuff, that this place might actually be an unexpected reality check, a brief respite for a ""stop and smell the roses"" moment. It was obviously more the scent of espresso than roses, of course, but I left there thinking, this just might be as good as it gets.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Friendly, funky place.  The Pulsar (caramel mocha) is outstanding.  Naiman and his family are just a lot of fun to hang out with, and the breakfast tacos from Tex-Mex are delicious.  I took a coffee class from Naiman, and he is still providing good ideas to us on how to get the best our of home coffee setup.",1
Coffee Shop 13,Went here on a whim after consulting with Yelp and found Great service and great coffee!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Makes the newcomer feel welcome... Heck, makes everyone who walks through the door feel welcome. Had high cafe, coffee  expectations when I relocated to Austin from Cambridge. Corona café exceeds all of them.  Naiman and family. All newcomers should visit upon arrival in Austin and then keep coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Great black drip coffee and yummy black bean, egg and cactus breakfast taco. Quaint and comfy.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"ROTD Corona is exactly the type of small neighborhood coffee shop that I am happy to support. The building is not the fanciest. You won't find granite fixtures and snooty leather chairs.  You will find a business owner who is absolutely passionate about coffee and taking care of customers. I thought I knew a fair bit about coffee until I talked the owner. I know nothing, Jon Snow.  That said, espresso is serious business to me. I am crippling my financial future, shorting my retirement, and eliminating a number of pricey private schools from my children's futures because of the amount of money I spend on espresso. Good espresso matters, and, when done well, it can be sublime.  I am heavily biased toward shops that use Cuvee beans (a local artisanal treasure and a shining example of what is right in the Austin food scene), so I was skeptical about Corona using different beans. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the drinks at Corona. The beans from Trianon, turned into a delicious rich espresso. The drink was great and a nice change of pace from the Cuvee that I drink almost every day.  To folks in the Mueller / Capital Plaza area, you should be patronizing this shop. If you are getting your daily fix at Starbucks or, gag, McDonalds, then you are making a terrible mistake. Come out and support an underdog and get superior coffee in the process. It's a win win. I'll drink a double to that.",1
Coffee Shop 13,Incredible coffee!  Owners are awesome people.  Driving cross country this is the best coffee I've had in the U.S.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"12 check-ins A great little coffee shop and cafe located 20 feet from Nomad bar on Corona Dr. at Cameron Rd. Owner Naiman Rigby and his perpetually pleasant staff serve up quality cups of love and do it with a smile every time.  Come here for some really top notch java (roasted & purchased locally in the nghd). The espresso is bold and always pulled to precision. The hot drip coffee and cold brewed toddys have exceptional levels of flavor. Try them first without your milk preference - I promise you'll be surprised at how superior Naiman's offerings are to your typical cup of joe.  They also offer Horchata (yup), hand crafted Kashmir chai, refreshing fruit seltzers (""agua frescas"") and syrups - ALL are made in the store. Like I said, Corona is all about quality drinks.  Arrive hungry as well. There are soups made in store from mama's recipes, made to order sammies, fruit & yogurt parfaits, breakfast tacos and pressed paninis to name some choices. Always ask what the chef has prepared today.  If it sounds like walking into Corona Cafe will leave you spoiled for choices on good food and great drinks then you are correct. It's a nice problem to have and Naiman and his staff will happily deliver you to flavor satisfaction.  Come chat with a friend, get some laptop work done or pop in for a quick caffeine fix. Either way, break the chains and come patronize this local gem! Deli sandwiches.",1
Coffee Shop 13,I love this place. So cool. House Coffee is  delicious. Staff is warm and generous. Pastries are fresh.  Excellent local coffee bar. I will be back and recommend to all my friends!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Naiman is the owner here, and he does a really good job of making you feel like family. I've been here twice now, and I feel completely comfortable dropping off my computer  on a big table and walking back outside to get even more equipment where I can set up my work station. I have taken full advantage of the free WIFI (better than at home, insanely, since I live in the neighborhood) and camaraderie.  For example, the first time I was here a mere two days ago, I met Marcus, who was working on a short film about bees... even though he knows zip about bees.  Then, the next time, I met Jeff... Jeff works at Nomad Bar.  He can SING! How do I know this? We sang together... at the coffee shop. Out loud. Naiman can sing too!!  We sang ""Rainbow Connection!""  All of us under its spell... we know that it's probably magic!!  Corona Cafe is magic. Like rainbows! Visit and check in to get 10% off. Or don't and pitch in to keep Naiman's dream alive!  (Contraband is strictly frowned upon.)",1
Coffee Shop 13,"5 check-ins I had a short informal meeting here and I was super nervous, but the owner's friendly face was so relaxing during the ordering process that I ended up having a pleasant time! I really like the casual warm atmosphere with sturdy wood tables and they are spaced far enough for a little privacy.  I ordered the Waikiki sneaky- organic fair trade coffee with salted caramel and frothy milky foam. I wasn't tempted by their baked goods for some reason, but the coffee was delicious and a good price. I'm usually a late night coffeehouse goer, but since I am in the area every week I could definitely see this being my place for the occasional coffee fix. Great addition to the neighborhood and the family running it are a delight.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Yeah, I hear they have excellent coffee. But I can actually think of at least 3 really good reasons to go there that have nothing to do with coffee:  1) As someone who doesn't often drink caffeine, I really appreciate their awesome selection of non-caffeinated drinks. (A lot of cafes only serve the same old, boring mint and chamomile teas). They have something called the 'Supernova' which is lemon-lime echinacea (with, I think, blackberry syrup) that is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.  2) This is a family owned and run place, where everyone is super nice.  I really enjoy going here for the sweet, and down to earth folks who work there.  3) They have my favorite kind of breakfast tacos! (Its the kind with cactus and black bean and egg, if you really want to know).",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Honestly I wanted to cry after coming here for the first time, in the best of ways. I really hate this word, but this place just feels so GENUINE. I ordered a chlorophyll latte which was so-so, and they have some tasty breakfast tacos, but the real pull is the people. I came here after dropping my brother off at the high school nearby, and realized that this is where all the teachers come before class to talk about how much they hate Greg Abbott, how the economy is fucked, and just in general talk about being liberal educators and how difficult saving the youth is. Highly recommended for people-listening and pretending to read your book.",1
Coffee Shop 13,great coffee shop to stop by when your in austin. Delicious coffee and tea and the staff is awesome!!!! very friendly and full of fun information about the ingredients. This shop has a great austin vibe!,1

Coffee Shop 13,"Tucked away in a strip mall, this little coffee shop has all you need to start your day. Great drip coffee and vegetarian breakfast tacos. The staff was very friendly and chatted with us for quite a while about things to do in Austin. They also make some of their own syrups and offer soy and almond milk as alternatives.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"A cozy, neighborhood spot for when you want to drink coffee and be productive without worrying about fitting into the overwhelming hip vibes of a coffee shop.

Coffee Shop 13,They know their coffee. Friendly knowledgable staff. Small yet comfortable coffeeshop. Nice place to just relax or work.  Best cup of joe I have had in a long time. I will be back.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"42 check-ins Listed in 78723: East Central, Coffee addicts, step up! It's sort of like walking into the Twilight Zone when you step in here. One minute, you're in the hood and the next minute you're inside a genie's bottle. I found myself here for the first time recently. And I've most definitely been back since my first visit. It sort of feels like you're walking into someone's home, and all their regular friends are there just hanging out and talking. I believe I was greeted by the owner, who was very nice and informed me of their offerings. I came in close to closing time (3PM) and ordered a large iced coffee, unsweetened and no room for cream (that's how I roll, black as night). It was delicious and I sat down for a bit trying to figure out what the wi-fi password was. Then I remembered I live 5 seconds away and there really was no need to find it out at that moment.  But really, I like this café a lot. It's in a strange shopping center right before you enter an older neighborhood. In fact, you can find it in the same place as Nomad. No problem parking here, there's also the lot in the back. Always somewhere to sit, since this place is kind of a secret. Friendly family that runs it, friendly customers, smack dab in the middle of the hood on the eastside? And I could totally walk, if you think it's safe. I'm in.",1
Coffee Shop 13,1)  slow service  2) refridgerator is rusty and old  3) looks like a bad garage sale exploded inside  5) bad espresso,0
Coffee Shop 13,There aren't many places in the world where I can have a Horchata (with coffee) in one hand and a breakfast taco (with cactus) in the other!,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Quaint, locally-owned coffee shop with great service and breakfast tacos. Oh, and coffee as well. With all the national chains nearby, it's nice to have this little place as an option nestled in Windsor Park. My only wish was that it was open a little earlier than 9 on the weekends. A must-stop if you're in the neighborhood!",1
Coffee Shop 13,Very good & friendly service - excellent breakfast tacos and coffee. Great vibe.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Friendly staff (and customers), great coffee and good breakfast tacos. It doesn't get much better than that on your morning commute.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure Best new discovery!  I have heard about this place and driven by, but this is the first time I went inside.  What a GREAT vibe, super friendly barista, lots of seating.  They've taken a boring strip-center-esque place and added so much warmth and color inside.  (Wall art is by his mother-in-law!)  I told the owner off-handedly I was visiting my bucket-list of coffee shops this month.  He said to contact him directly if there was anything he could change or if my coffee wasn't ""perfect"" to me.  Man... that's skin in the game!  I guess you can say that if you really do deliver 5 star service!  I can't believe this is so close to my house and I am just being blessed w/ the discovery.  Will return as soon as my caffeine hangover wears off.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Great coffee and even better people!  Best cold-brew iced coffee in town. Sometimes they even have homemade almond milk (which I've never seen anywhere else), which they use to make horchata. Try a half iced-coffee, half horchata if it's available. Incredibly good.  This is a genuine neighborhood coffee shop that I am very happy to have near me. Small, friendly, unpretentious, laid-back, and family-owned by native Austinites.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Wow horrible misguide by yelpers.  I walked 30 minutes to give this place a try.  Never got the chance.  I walked in the beyond hot stuffy little dump to be third in line to order.  Looking at the filthy decor and cheap trinkets for sale.  You quickly realize you are waiting for pre packaged food, coffee that takes the guy forever to make while standing at the counter of somebody's kitchen.  Just a bad experience the second you walk in.  The barista should have been faster and not given me the chance to look around the place.  Epic fail yelp.  Horrible location and filthy.  Coffee just can't be that good to overlook the rest of the place, but I will never know.",0
Coffee Shop 13,"I spotted Corona Cafe last year while taking my kiddo to school. I decided to wheel in one day, and I'm glad I did. Wonderful coffee, and great people behind the bar. (And it seems like a magnet for intriguing customers.)  A few other folks have commented on Naiman's passion for top-quality coffee. It's so true -- I think he's a teacher at heart, and he's always happy to use his encyclopedic knowledge of coffee to field any questions I've had.  Always a pleasure to stop by CC and get my day off to a good start.",1
Coffee Shop 13,Locally owned business that makes you feel at home. Customer service was wonderful. Coffee and breakfast tacos were great. Would recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"Considering all the great reviews I read about this place before checking it out, I was not impressed with my experience this morning. The watery coffee and grocery store muffin I order cost more than $5 and the lady behind the counter was too busy talking to another staff member to finish our conversation. Also, in general it bugs me when prices aren't posted on the menu.",0
Coffee Shop 13,"Cozy place with familial vibes. This coffee shop is perfect to study/hang out, with a good music not too loud. Their coffee selection is huge & really good. Owners are super nice, which is always a plus ! Definitely worth to check out, it's the kind of spot you wanna go to on a regular basis. Parking is convenient.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Corona Cafe is my little home away from home. The staff and owner are friendly and just the right amount of chatty. The coffee is on point, by far the most important thing. The great me almost every morning with a smile and my coffee. Keep it up Corona! Noms",1
Coffee Shop 13,"9 check-ins I wish they didn't close at 3 p,m. But I'm happy they're open when they are. Good coffee prepared with attention and skill - and friendly knowledgable staff happy to talk coffee. I live in the neighborhood, and this place has it all - except longer hours.",1
Coffee Shop 13,The mochas are unbelievable. Get the orange iced mocha-- the owner said it took him two years to make this drink right and I'm so glad he did. All ingredients are organic from the milk to the coffee to the syrups. So glad I discovered this gem in my neighborhood!,1
Coffee Shop 13,My favorite coffee shop on this side of town.  Great owners.  Great coffee.  Delicious sandwiches.  Love it.,1
Coffee Shop 13,Cozy! Delicious green tea latte with blackberry syrup made from scratch!!! breakfast tacos very good as well. Nice and friendly owners/staff.,1
Coffee Shop 13,"This place is exactly what a friendly neighborhood cafe should be.  I drive far out of my way to visit this coffee shop, and the owners always make me feel so welcome when I do. The family who owns this shop are the nicest and coolest people I've ever met, their awesome kids work here too and make the best drinks!  Everytime I have been here I have tried something new and have never been disappointed. Everything from the home-made muffins to the home-made sandwiches are delicious!  -Try the orange-cranberry muffin -The tomato-basil sandwich. Can't go wrong with chicken salad either. -Their iced coffee is the best! I also love the iced chai, or ask them to make you an Italian soda! -They even get cupcakes from a local baker on occasion and they are delicious!  As for the shop itself, I can only say nice things. It's so cozy, the wifi is super-fast considering the place is always filled with people using their laptops, and it's very clean. They always play great music (never too loud though, so I can still work, but enjoy it)  Unlike the other reviews, I don't mind in the slightest that they are closed on the weekends, because not only do they sell weekend coffee-provisions (brilliant) but I understand that spending time with family is important, these people work very hard and deserve that.  This place is my new home away from home.  Corona Cafe-can't top that!",1
Coffee Shop 13,"This is a really cute little coffee shop in north Austin. As soon as you walk in you can tell it's lovingly run by the folks who own it, as it feels exactly as a coffee shop should: cozy, ""home made"" and with lots of interesting photos and artwork all over the place. The family that runs it was overly welcoming, chatting me up about this, that and the other and just making you feel like you're completely welcome to hang around. Seriously, they were some of the nicest people I have ever known. It feels like hanging out in your mom's kitchen.  Loved me some breakfast tacos (I hadn't been to Austin for awhile and forgot just how great those little wrapped up Mexican fingerfoods can be!) and the coffee was just perfect.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in the city.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Updated review This place has improved tremendously since I was last here. The interior feels like you are inside someone's living room, which is very comforting. I love this place.  P.S. They make homemade muffins and they are the best muffins I have ever eaten. BAR NONE.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"All-around positive vibes at this laid-back coffee shop w/ great food, juice and other options as well. Especially if you're staying in one of the depressing chain hotels near here, you owe it to yourself to spend your morning here.",1
Coffee Shop 13,I moved to this neighborhood right when the new owners first took over the cafe. I really wanted to like this place since it is local and close by. I never have a decent experience at this café unless the parents are working.  I have gotten food from Corona a few times everything is fine except the breakfast tacos. They are never good. The tacos always have weird synthetic after taste and are dry. Even salsa can't help those tacos.  I brought my visiting family to the cafe 40 minutes before closing. The daughter wasn't flat out rude but needs a little more training in customer service. She asked us if we we're planning on staying to drink our coffee or leaving. We responded we were going to stay and enjoy our coffee. She then proceeded to tell us they were closing soon with that sweet teenage I really want you to leave now face. What she should have done was put our drinks in to go cups and let us sit and enjoy our coffee (mind you the place still had a couple of customers). I was so frustrated with the service I did not order a drink. My mother and sister were unhappy with their watered down drinks and were disappointed I brought them to Corona Cafe.  This was my worst experience yet. I will not recommend this place. And I will not go there again.,0
Coffee Shop 13,"I want to give this place five stars, but the fact that they're not open on weekends (or haven't been the last few times I've tried to go) and I work most of the week makes it difficult.  Coffee is from Texas Coffee Traders, and I love that. It's family owned, and even the high school? age kids know how to make a good latte.  Mom makes fresh 'box lunches' every day. So far I've had a fresh turkey sandwich with a small pile of yummy mixed nuts (no peanuts in sight), grapes and shortbread cookies dipped in dark chocolate, and homemade chicken salad sandwich (with apples!) with strawberries and crunchy Annie's grahams on the side. Perfect portions; I love that its not crappy kettle chips and a wobbly pickle thrown on the side.  Especially if you live in 78723, it's worth checking out.",1
Coffee Shop 13,"Updated review Brother Rigby at Corona Café has just upgraded his espresso machine, and the product transformation is remarkable. The new, improved latte comes roaring out of the chute like an unbroken horse.  Unsaddle your morning at Corona Café and start the day at full gallop!",1
Coffee Shop 13,Orange infused mocha is amazing!! The owners are super friendly and it is apparent they care about their ingredients. Will be back!!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Wonderful. Do not be fooled by the business exterior, the interior of this coffee shop is warm and welcoming. Seating is nice but outlets are sparse so make sure you're fully charged if you plan on staying a while.  The coffee is very good, I got a caffe mocha and my friend got an iced coffee both were refreshing with minimal bitterness or acidity. The bagel breakfast sandwiches we got were delicious! We both got the ham, egg, cheese, and tomato sandwiches. Mine was on a rosemary bagel and his was on the Jalapeño cheddar. Both were delicious and filling.  They also have breakfast tacos and the option of having your sandwich on a croissant. For lunch they offer crepes. Along with some muffins and a few types of pastries they offer in the counter case.  All in all, definitely a new east Austin favorite.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"What a good find on the south side!  I'm never on the south side, so I'm sure I'm missing many great places. However, as I was driving down south to take my sister to the airport, we stopped off here to kill some time before her flight took off. We both ordered chai teas, and plugged in our laptops and enjoyed the ambiance for a while.  This place was super busy when we were there, despite having lots of tables/seating. The service was excellent, our drinks were great, and we enjoyed our time here.  Not that I'll ever be in the area again any time soon, but if I am, I'll gladly make another stop here!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I went in for brunch today to cafe creme . Ordered green tea matcha latte and the salmon crepe.  Was not expecting much from matcha latte but turns out it was delicious ! Would definitely recommend it. For the crepe, it was slightly Luke warm. Would have preferred it little hotter but tasted ok. It was quite filling.  There are lot of tables so good seating options. Didn't see many outlets though.  Would definitely come back again to try out some more of the items on their menu!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Ordered a 12oz coffee and a breakfast taco. Both reasonably priced and delicious. If you're considering the breakfast tacos, I wouldn't get more than 2 at a time, they're pretty big. Yoga cats!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"When we found this place online we pictured something entirely different, not a bad thing by any means, but the logo and website don't really match the cafe itself. It's on the quirky side with funky music, strange art, and yoga cat table numbers.  The staff was incredibly friendly and offered suggestions while we tried to figure out what to order. Not because their menu is overwhelming... but because we're just very indecisive...  We opted for a dirty chai and a dirty green tea latte which led to me wishing I had ordered a bigger size because they were delicious. We also ordered a lox bagel and some sort of pesto/tomato/mozzarella/spinach thing. I really wanted a breakfast sandwich but this specific one was egg-free, so I had them put an egg on it. Don't do what I did. The sandwich was huge and had way too much going on. I ended up taking the egg off and enjoying it much more.  If we're in the neighborhood again I'd definitely stop in for another dirty green tea latte!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Came here with friends on the weekend because they wanted to get some Crepes. It was actually pretty delicious. I was quite surprised. It's located in an office area or sorts. There is plenty of parking around the building. It's a walk up and order place and the food is brought out to the table. I got the Tuscany with chicken and my friends got the Saigon. It was very good though. The crepe was very filling. I felt that the Tuscany was folded much better and there was less empty space, whereas the Saigon had a lot of empty space with no filling. I enjoyed both and would come back for more though and recommend it to others as well! See all photos from Jennifer N. for Café Crème",1
Coffee Shop 9,We got there at 8:04am. 4 minutes after they opened. The gentleman behind the counter was super nice and wasn't upset that we showed up right when they opened. I ordered a mocha frappe which was delicious and we ordered two crepes. We sat down and the coffee was brought to us promptly.  About 40 minutes had passed and no crepe. I went to check on them and the gentleman was surprised that we didn't receive them yet. Turns out the printer got disconnected... Not their fault.  The lady from the kitchen came out and apologized to us again and asked if we want anything else.. We asked if we could have a chocolate croissant. They brought us TWO chocolate croissants and fresh squeezed lemonade that we didn't even ask for. So kind of them!  Our crepes arrived shortly after that and was delicious.  I would recommend this place to everyone and be back. Food was good and the service was very good as well. :) Cool decor Yum See all photos from Saila I. for Café Crème,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Love that there are plenty of seats and there's a lot of natural lighting inside. It's not super dark like at most coffeeshops I've been to.  Their iced caramel latte is OK....not near the best ones I've had. And it's pricier compared to other places. Size large ""for here"" is a standard Mason jar, and it's not worth the $5.14 I paid if we're talking just about size.  There are several menu items to choose from, not just pastries like at most coffeeshops. I think there's an outlet near or at every table and there's wifi (although it's not as fast as I would like it to be). I'd definitely come here to work remotely if I ever needed to. Iced caramel latte, nothing added or taken out, made wth three pumps of syrup and not enough for me..",1
Coffee Shop 9,"2 check-ins Really really like this place. Great coffee, yummy food (breakfast tacos til 2:30!) and cutesy little vibe. Local artists are always displayed and there's a take one leave one type bookshelf. Very cool. Don't let the exterior fool you- check it out! Iced chai",1
Coffee Shop 9,"4 check-ins I am so pleased any time my commute takes me past Café Crème. Their service is friendly and drinks are great. However, what really sets them apart are their crepes. Each time I try their salmon crepe I wonder why they aren't more common. I recommend giving them a try.  Their atmosphere is warm and friendly. The baristas are always welcoming and willing to chat if you're hanging around the counter. Like many local coffee shops, their walls feature local art - available to purchase if you like! This definitely adds to the local flavor.  If you are in the area, I recommend giving this coffee shop a shot. Pun intended. Don't forget your loyalty stamp card!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"This place is easy to miss if you are headed East on Oltorf. I ended up flipping a u-turn in the strip mall parking lot just past it in order to make my way over. Upon entering you are immediately greeted with local art, including cassette tape canvass portraits of Johnny Cash and Bob Marley. There is a bakery case filled with bagels, croissants, pastries, cookies and kolaches. The seating area is a combination of small tables with chairs, sofas and an oversized leather chair and ottoman that has seen better days but still looks pretty darned comfortable.  In addition to the bakery items, there offer breakfast tacos, oatmeal, hand made savory tarts, an assortment of sweet and savory crêpes, and salads. The service was friendly and fast. They provide you with a cat card on a stanchion (instead of a number) to put on your table and they bring the food and coffee to you.  I ordered an Americano with foam on top and the Versailles crêpe with Brie cheese, artichoke, mushroom, onion and spinach. And while I enjoyed my coffee and crêpe, I really loved my dining companion's crêpe madame more - which was a crêpe monsieur (smoked ham, swiss cheese, rosemary honey mustard) with an egg on top. Next time, I will order that for myself.  All in all, Café Crème provides a relaxing art-filled Austin ambiance w/ great coffee & delicious food. It's all about that foam Bakery case Forget taking a number, take a cat. See all photos from Darla A. for Café Crème",1
Coffee Shop 9,We arrived very early in the afternoon and the kitchen was closed apparently. The place is not kept well and the pastries look very unappetizing. Macaroons were tasty.,0
Coffee Shop 9,"Perfect. Excellent coffee, plenty of comfortable seating, strong wifi, quiet background music, easy access/parking. Everything you want in a coffee shop, and a nice break from the elements on a hot Austin day!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I stopped in here to feed my latte addiction (""help me I'm poor "" ) . I ordered the cremé brûlée latte and the Saigon crepe.  The gentlemen who took my order gave me the suggestion for the crepe and allowed me to do double steak instead of the way it came with steak and potato. The suggestion was spot on as it was lift healthy and delicious. The latte was perfectly sweetened and seasoned for a September day. Looking forward to coming back here for future study sessions The cremé brûlée coffees d the Saigon crepe. Both were absolutely excellent!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"This is a good AM breakfast stop if you're working in South Austin - here's why:  1) Location: Near 35, this spot is perfect if you're traveling west on Oltorf before hopping on the highway to work.  The place is easy to miss - it's in a building that looks better suited for a dentist than a cafe.  Forget about making a left into this lot when heading east... there is a ton of oncoming traffic.  However, a plus for this location is it's easy parking.  2) Service: The service was on-point.  The staff were everything you'd expect from a small business.  Very efficient but also friendly.  3) Product: My coffee was delicious and my everything bagel with bacon and egg was good.  The bagel was a little dry, and the eggs could've had more seasoning.  I would recommend asking for a toasted and buttered bagel to improve the overall sandwich.  4) Work Space: There were two spaces with small tables.  There was also a conference space of sorts that could be reserved.  From the outside, it doesn't seem as big.  If I lived in this neighborhood, I would go all the time. Colorful assortment of baked goods Kambucha to go",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I had no idea this place existed until I took a shortcut on the way home and spotted it. I LOVE coffee shops, so I had to check it out. Their coffee is great. I drink mine black so a smooth, not burnt, coffee is always my hope and they did not disappoint. Also, they have breakfast tacos! And crepes! And it's all available until 3! Yay! I've never been to France, so I can't compare but I thought my crepe was very tasty. I'm excited to come back and try more. It's a little bit backwards in that they bring everything out to you without utensils or fixings and no one mentions where to find such items. (They're on a table by the front, that you've forgotten about by the time you order and sit down) But staff is very friendly and available guide you in the right direction. I am so excited to have found this place. Pretty darn tasty.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Great little place!  Great artwork, laid back, great breakfast tacos... We will be back...",1
Coffee Shop 9,"There are a lot of coffee shops and cafes here in Austin, but Cafe Creme stands out as one of my favorites.  I had the Nova Scotia crepe and, considering the pricing, I was shockingly surprised and satisfied.  I also order the cafe creme brulee and that also did not disappoint.  I don't know how they do it, but they managed to make the foam good lol.    There's plenty of seating here, but I wish they would place some plants around the tables to separate the tables from the parked cars.  Whenever I'm at Mozart's, I keep telling myself that I wished they had Cafe Creme's food/crepes/desserts.  Don't think that's going to happen though.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I don't know why anyone would rate this anything under five stars. This place is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin, with Fair Bean coming close second. The atmosphere is just so peaceful, and the baristas are by far the nicest people you will ever meet. Every time I come here, good quality coffee, crepes, kombucha on tap, and spectacular service, everything really is good here. Nothing pretentious or upscale about this coffee shop as opposed to all the other little places around town. If you're anything like me, appreciate good service and quality, go here before Starbucks. It's the same price if not cheaper and tastes 1000x better. Ps, the blonde barista with the blue eyes is the nicest one I have met so far, they are all nice! But I especially felt a good customer to merchant appreciation with him! Management, if you read these reviews, give him a  pat on the back, and yourself too, for running a great coffee shop.  Thanks for reading!",1
Coffee Shop 9,Updated review I have to add that I wish this place was open later than 7pm! And that they brought back the huge chocolate croissants.,1
Coffee Shop 9,This place has friendly staff and a great atmosphere! The cold brew is excellent and not overpriced!!! I just moved here and plan to be back very soon!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"This place is so cute! Love that they have a book exchange! Pleasant environment, coffee was phenomenal, food was good. If I was in my corner of the woods id make it my local coffee spot. I had the cream cheese kolache... That was delicious!!! Staff was also very friendly... This place is perfect for reading, studying or doing work because it's quiet and well lit and the music they play is soft and not distracting Cream cheese kolache!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Updated review While my first visit didn't work out, the owner personally contacted me and went out of her way to make things right! Faulty machinery led to a singular bad day. I will be giving Cafe Creme another try! Raw thick doughy crepe with a slab of Brie!!!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I placed an order for pick-up over the phone and when I showed up the food wasn't ready (I had to work so I was in a hurry and left).  There was a misunderstanding about the time I would be in.  Instead of just letting it go, the staff (Sue, specifically) actually went above and beyond to text me and apologize and then she let me know that I could come in any time to pick up a bagel and coffee on the house.  WHAT EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!!!! I am so impressed and pleased.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Kolache and green tea muffin along with my coffee to go please!  The Kolache was great. Warm, jalapeño cheddar hot dog inside a soft bun. How can you really go wrong? The green tea muffin was good, the green tea flavor was subtle but I prefer mine to have a bigger flavor. Still yummy though. Kolache with green tea muffin and a coffee",1
Coffee Shop 9,"2 check-ins I love Cafe creme! I always forget to check-in here or else I'd be a regular on Yelp.  They offer delicious drinks and a full menu of food. I enjoy coming here on Sunday mornings with my partner. We sip coffee, eat pastries and kolaches, and enjoy the good vibes. I'm all about good vibes.  There is indoor and outdoor seating. They have a book exchange and adorable decor. Like I said, just good vibes. Fill up your stamp card and you get a drink on the house. Little nook in the back with more space to work. See all photos from Kris C. for Café Crème",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Love, love, love this place. The book exchange is awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"This place is a gem. From the outside, it doesn't look like much and being on busy Oltorf road I never thought to stop in. My neighbor referred it to me because I was looking for a good breakfast sandwich. Today is my second day in a row coming because I have fallen in love with their spinach pesto artichoke tomatoe and mozzarella on a croissant. And with the boy behind the counter.. The atmosphere is calming, the fresh teas are delish, there's more than enough seating indoors and out and parking too. Go check it out if you're on Riverside part of town!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Noms!! We ordered the Nova Scotia and the Saigon crepes. Explosions of flavor for each crepe. I ordered the Nova Scotia because I love Lox and it reminded me of it and it did not disappoint. It was delicious and completely refreshing (especially for those hot summer days in Austin). On the other hand, the Saigon was the opposite in which it was an explosion of rich, savorful flavors. Still delicious.  The establishment gives off a studious college vibe. There are scattered tables perfect for diners/studiers of 1, 2, or a mild sized group. It was quiet when we went (around lunch time) with diners on their laptops, studying from their books, and sipping on their coffees. Besides crepes, the establishment also offers baked goods, which we have yet to try.  Warning: they stop serving crepes around a certain time (2 pm?). Check their website before you go if you are intent on some delicious crepes or otherwise you're setting yourself up for huge heartbreak. Nova Scotia (forefront) and Saigon crepes (back)",1
Coffee Shop 9,"This is kind of mean but I hope this cafe doesn't ever get too popular - I Love the chill vibe, the lay out, the perfect size, the pastries and the Vietnamese coffee. I can really relax here, the music playlist is always so good and not generic, the baristas are straightforward and easygoing. I can always find a table and it's far away enough from campus to not be overloaded with students. I recommend the salted chocolate chip cookie and the Vietnamese coffee, but not at the same time :) sugar high for days!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"2 check-ins Thoroughly enjoyed my visit yesterday. I ordered a dirty Chai and a bagel with egg and bacon on it. Dirty Chai was perfect -sweet, but not too sweet. Bagel was rosemary salt from Rockstar bagels, which is always a good choice. Bacon was cooked just the way I like it - crispy but not burned.  Atmosphere was nice. It's a small place, but they've done well with layout of tables and furniture. After eating,  we played chess. There are board games available on the shelves that you can play, and books too.  A few people were hanging out on their laptops and doing work, so you know the WiFi has to be pretty good.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I've visited Cafe Creme a handful of times, since I used to live nearby and now work close by. I love love LOVE their baked goods! Their iced black coffee is amazing and, as someone who is lactose-intolerant, this is a huge relief. The staff is usually super nice and friendly, and space is super nice and comfortable.  The only reason for a 4-star review is because of the ""hiccups"" I've hit when ordering something made hot/fresh. In the past, I put in an order for some breakfast sandwiches, only to be told that the chef wasn't yet in to do it. This was, admittedly, my fault since I pretty much came a few minutes after opening. I decided to give it another shot a few weeks later, and was disappointed by my egg and cheese breakfast croissant sandwich. The egg was burnt and the croissant was very stale. I'm not sure if I was just doubly-unlucky, but I'd like to think others would have a better experience with ordering cooked-to-order items from here.  Overall, Cafe Creme is worth the visit to grab some delicious pastries and fabulous coffee, but you may be taking a gamble on the cooked-to-order foods!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"We were overcharged based on the menu price. Received attitude from the staff when pointing out the issue. Mediocre food, much better options close by.  Never come back!!",0
Coffee Shop 9,"This place is pretty unexpected as far as East (of I-35) Oltorf goes. It is a quaint little coffee shop, featuring a menu filled with fantastic flavors. I got the Snickers coffee drink (because it's Friday), and a white chocolate blonde brownie (because I'm an adult, and eat what I want). Both were fantastic.  The staff was helpful and courteous, and the atmosphere was quiet, with some people working on computers, and others socializing quietly, or reading books. They have a ""Leave a book, take a book"" book exchange library which is super Austin-y, and definitely something I look forward to taking advantage of with some old college textbooks I've been looking to put somewhere.  I'll certainly be back, and I'll bring enough money to buy them out of white chocolate blonde brownies. Don't forget to pick up a coffee drink stamp card for rewards!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"We really are spoiled for choice when it comes to coffee places in austin. However, Cafe Creme stands out amongst the rest. While it perhaps isn't as ""hip"" as some other joints in Austin, their pastries are phenomenal (especially when they heat them up,) they pull great espresso shots using good coffee beans (I often find some of the artisan coffee beans that places in Austin use aren't that great because they're too oily or tangy tasting.)  The atmosphere is incredibly chill and relaxed. It's a great place to get a lot of work done with minimal distractions.    Having been to almost every coffee establishment in Austin, I can safely say that this is among the best.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I tried this place yesterday; the Mexican mocha was delicious! My friend & I also ordered savoury crepes which we were a bit sceptical about ordering, but when they arrived they were incredibly tasty! The place itself was very cute and relaxing and I loved the idea of swapping books with other visitors. Staff were very friendly and helpful; my only criticism is that a few more lunch options would have been nice; a few of my party chose not to eat. But nevertheless, we will be back! Thank you for a great experience.",1
Coffee Shop 9,Love this place! Came here for the first time fora work meeting and I fell in love since. Their Cafe Creme Brûlée coffee is life changing and has me hooked. Today I also had the cheese Danish and the Nova Scotia crepe!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Worth the drive! First koloche in our Texas relocation, gonna be hard to beat. The Crossiant with pesto, artichoke, cheese and spinach was delightful!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Updated review I Come here often, they have great breakfast tacos and the coffee is consistent. There is always a place to sit, and my dog enjoys the outdoor seats. My previous review was hasty, the folks who run this place do a great job and were quick to remedy and respond to my initial review.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Loved finding this little gem and so happy it's so close to work! Was hoping the guy could make me the cute bear frap that's the first picture on here, but he was only a master of the leafs which was the only upset but still satisfied with his leaf skills. Ordered the bacon egg & cheese croissant. Hands down the best breakfast sandwich I have ever eaten. Was perfectly melted and cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is more than relaxing with plenty of local art to look at that you can purchase too if you'd like. Will definitely be my new go to spot for a cup of joe Not a bear, but still cute :)",1
Coffee Shop 9,"-I've been here several times and have had nothing but great experiences.   -My favorite is the iced chai & hot Mexican mocha. -The staff is always friendly-even when they are busy, they are alway pleasant and never rush you.  Definitely my favorite coffee shop in the Oltorf area. Iced chai! I added cinnamon",1
Coffee Shop 9,Breakfast tacos are YUMazing! Coffee is super good! Stagg is very nice. Love the atmosphere too!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Ok, I've gone here a lot now and figured I should encourage others to stop in and check it out.  My three highs (not coffee related):    1. Book swap shelf in the back    2. Super chill but productive atmosphere. Idk but I feel like I can get things done here.    3. Friendly staff!  I really like this place for a fancy coffee date. Try the crepes, believe me they're worth it.",1
Coffee Shop 9,Hidden treasure. I love the savory crepes. Stop by when you can and don't be intimidated by the line. They move fast.,1
Coffee Shop 9,Loved this place. Breakfast tacos and crepes were awesome. Would definitely go back.,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Atmosphere, staff, and the coffee is 5 stars. Food is just OK - so 3 stars. I got a savory crepe but it tasted like a sweet ham sandwich and the crepe layer wasn't that great. Overall rating is thus 4 stars.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I ordered a simple beverage, my go-to regular drink. Double espresso, steamed heavy cream.  The place is called ""Café Crème"" ... you'd think they had cream. But they don't. They have half-and-half. And worse than that, they didn't tell me that they didn't have cream, and offer half-and-half, they just got it out of the fridge and poured half and half, as if I didn't care or wouldn't notice.  Sorry Café Crème. You're a well-located, attractively-decorated place (like every other coffee shop in Austin) with mediocre coffee that stands out as worse for not getting my order right or appearing to care.",0
Coffee Shop 9,"Came here for the first time today. I work remotely so I coffee-shop-hop a lot. Love the decor and they had an awesome, friendly staff. Enjoyed my cortada and got a lot of work done!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Everything tasted amazing. We ordered: -Saigon crepe -Florence crepe -breakfast taco -sausage and cheese kolache  Personally, I was most impressed with the crepes. I also got the dirty chai latte, which was delicious. It's also a perfect space to get work done. It's nice and quiet and the music/ tables/ chairs/ atmosphere is perfect for getting work done Florence crepe with bananas and Nutella. So good Florence crepe with bananas and Nutella. So good Saigon crepe with skirt steak, potato, onion. Delicious",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I've been coming here for a month now and it's super awesome. Very warm and welcoming feeling, good tacos, great tea and coffee, and a cool and helpful staff. I've taken like 6 Tinder girls here and they are always impressed. Looking forward to the next 6.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"So I've been here a few times.  I started working in the area again and rediscovered this place. I've been going 2 to 3 times a week  for the coffee.  I always grab a 16oz coffee.  From the first day, I've always been given a to go cup. I was told that the coffee comes with a refill. I know this because I offered to pay for a 2nd cup one day and was told this. Today, this sour-faced little girl,  tells me, with attitude. . it's going to be a  $1.35 for a refill,  after I spent  $10 on a crossant with a fried egg and a coffee (rediculous). Sad that customer service is non existent these days. Now I have to find a  new spot.",0
Coffee Shop 9,Best cold Brew and Vietnamese coffee in Austin! Stopped in for crepes : we got the Monterey and the Saigon with egg and it was delicious. Definitely would recommend. We'll be back. The place is well decorated and smells great. Staff friendly and helpful. Crepes!,1
Coffee Shop 9,Updated review 2 check-ins Eating a cafe creme Kolache (Kolach?) for breakfast wondering how I ever survived the morning without them!!! So good! Mmm pecan & Vietnamese cold brews!!! So good,1
Coffee Shop 9,"My sister and I went to Café Crème yesterday morning. I ordered a breakfast taco, a cheese Danish & a Carmel Crème. My sister got a bagel with lox, cream cheese, tomatoes, onions and capers & a breve with honey. She loved what she got and I did as well. All was very tasty. We didn't have to wait long and we loved the art. We are definitely planning to go back.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Absolutely love Cafe Creme! Very glad a good (non corporate) coffee shop had come to Oltorf! Very friendly, fast, and tasty. Comfortable setting and complementary conference room with minimum purchase. GO LOCAL!!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"I went to Cafè Crème on a quick break from a work training. I wanted to find some decent coffee around me and Cafè Cremè was it. I ordered a pecan cold brew and it was pretty good. It wasn't overwhelmingly nutty and I added a tiny bit of half and half to it. I give it a solid 7.5. It smelled delicious inside, like fresh baked goods and they seem to have some good things, food-wise on the menu. If I'm over in that area again wanting coffee I'd definitely go back. They also have a 15% discount on one coffee beverage when you check in on facebook.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Really good coffee & drinks! The coffee was nice, smooth, good, robust flavor. I ate lunch here once, and the food was surprisingly good! Definitely better than run-of-the-mill Starbucks. I had tomato soup, which was hearty & flavorful, a really good roll/flatbread to go with it, and they even had bun bao's on this particular day, which I had as well. To fix my sweet tooth I got a chocolate chip cookie. Ambiance is chill & mellow, service was friendly. What a great little cafe spot! Everything was on point!",1
Coffee Shop 9,35 check-ins The selection of coffee is great. Ordered an iced pecan coffee and Mexican mocha coffee and both awsome. The food menu has a nice selection. Impressed with kolache. Very enjoyable place.,1
Coffee Shop 9,"The pecan cold brew is stellar. They also have delicious pastries, particularly the cream cheese kolaches. They are a little pricey so I can't stop by as often as I might like to.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Very happy to have a local coffee shop in the area with quality food options. Staff is friendly, americano was hot, and crepes were delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"5 check-ins What a great hidden gem on Oltorf. If you get a chance go in and try the Mexican Mocha. They have a nice variety of tasty pastries, kolaches, and other sweets. They also have tacos. They have tables to sit at and a nice couch area if you want to stay and relax. I've seen people reading and on their laptops kind of like a Starbucks...only local...and better. Chocolate Croissants Ham & cheese croissant and a Mexican Mocha.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Probably my favorite coffee shop in Austin. Where to begin?  The food. Most coffee shops bring in outside food. Not this place. Everything is made in house. I LOVE their kolaches. Very delicious heated up. I've also tried their white chocolate blondies, chocolate cookie with sea salt, and their crumble cake. All taste great!  Not crowded. It's a little further from UT campus, but definitely worth the drive.  The Internet here is pretty fast. You can actually get work done here.  The music is not obnoxious. Jazz music at an appropriate volume level. definitely beats the Miley Cyrus I've heard at other coffee shops.  There's adequate lighting and not like the coffee shop caves I've been to.  Check it out!!!",1
Coffee Shop 9,Ben did a great job. Cool indie vibe. Good coffee. The setup is a little awkward. Good parking options and easy to access.,1
Coffee Shop 9,Yes!! Definitely my favorite coffee shop in Austin. The atmosphere there is so cozy and the drinks are delicious. I have no bad things to say about this place. Everything is delicious and the service is great!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX The area is just a littlee shady but Cafe Creme is a nice place. Great place to work due to there being plenty of seats (including a couch and a random conference room), free and FAST wifi, and a decently-sized parking lot. Ambiance-wise, there are many quirks like interesting artwork and an organ, but I am pretty sure that this this building was formerly a low-budget office (like many of its neighbors)...  Selection of drinks is good and very reasonably-priced. I believe Cafe Creme only opened just recently, so there are lots of great deals if you keep your eyes open (check PayPal and check in on Yelp!).",1
Coffee Shop 9,"It's definitely a great place to be after waking up at 730 am on Saturday not hung over. I am not being sarcastic. There are not a lot of cafés available on east Oltorf. This June has lots of space and brings in a crowd similar to that of most Austin keep it weir keep it local establishments.  Love the atmosphere. Check. You know that already. The dude working the counter is cool. Knows when to keep a convo going and when you are too tired to chat.  I Gotta try the food  and coffee now. I am having a medium roast blend. With a check in--it was only 1.83$. Suck it Stupid Starbucks--kreepin it local. They have some cool art. This is ""noey's boat"" by Eya Floyd.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Super cute place!!! Very relaxing and has FREE WIFI! So bring your laptop...bring your iPad/iPhone....and start facebooking in this adorably precious public place.  Great place for UT students to study.  My husband and I stopped by after our drive back from San Antonio. We had been wanting to check out this place for a while...it had some great reviews! We thought....""why not...it's on the way home!"" I ordered a decaf iced vanilla latte and my husband ordered the iced cafe creme brûlée. DELISH! not too sweet...nice and cold. Served in cute little glass cups.  We wanted to try some pastries...but were super full from our lunch...but I'll have to check out their kolaches and croissants next time. Decaf iced vanilla latte and iced cafe creme brûlée. Delish !",1
Coffee Shop 9,Nice food and ambiance.  Good place for kids and the family to come and have a small breakfast.,1
Coffee Shop 9,Love this spot! I come to Austin every month for business and try to stop by here each trip. Their coffee is great and the vibe is nice and chill. They have great breakfast tacos and their nutella pastry is amazing!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I went here for brunch and tried the croque Madame crepe (the one with the egg), the Saigon crepe, Mexican hot chocolate, matcha green tea latte (hot), and both the sausage and cheese kolache and the jalapeño one. My favorite thing out of everything was the matcha green tea latte! It was the best one I've ever had! Everything was delicious and we were both pleased with the experience! The service was also friendly and super fast as well! We left very happy and stuffed!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Decent coffee and pastries were good, though there was a large black fly buzzing around the inside of the display cabinet - I do wish food establishments would take more notice of these things, so minus a half star for that. Minus the other half for a sullen cashier. I'd go back for takeout.",1
Coffee Shop 9,14 check-ins A truly phenomenal coffee shop in the south east of Austin!  Great beverages and the homemade goodies are delicious! SOOO happy I can walk in about a minute to this place from my home.  I have never been disappointed and don't expect to. I wish I could bake as well as they do. A little boy gingerbread couple GURL is about to buy and stuff my face with all those house made gingerbread men!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Just don't come here until summer, I need the space to study. I joke. They play nice background-ish music, even the Handsome boy modeling school's ""The Truth"" (a cool cover of ""Coffee Cold"") Good Kombucha and food.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"12 check-ins In a single word, amazing.  The moment you walk into this place, you get an amazing smell of fresh pastries. The staff is very kind and attentive, and the pastries are amazing. I myself love the cheddar sausage kolaches and the cinnamon rolls.  The drinks aren't priced any more expensive than any usual place. My favorite being the Creme Brûlée. Just the right amount of sugar and great flavor.  The best part about the staff is that they are open to criticism of the drinks and are actively working to make them better.  As far as the atmosphere goes, its very laid back with some background music so add to the ambience. The decoration primarily consists of artists' paintings on the walls which are for sale.  Seating is pretty good with plenty of tables for 2 people, tables for 4 people and a couple couches to sit on. There is also outdoor seating.  They even have a book exchange here if you were interested in reading something a little different. Caramel Cremé",1
Coffee Shop 9,"4 check-ins The creative crepe menu makes it difficult to decide which one to try, they're delicious!  The sausage&cheese kolaches keep me coming back every time; with the quick service, this is the perfect place to stop by on an easy Sunday morning. Tried the Matcha Green Tea Frappe for the first time, I was not disappointed! It tastes like a green tea milkshake. This cinnamon bun is as big as my face",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Just left there 5 minutes ago and I'm in love with this place already! It's great if you're looking for a chill place to have breakfast. My boyfriend and I got there around 10am on a Sunday morning and the place was not crowded at all and we didn't have to wait at all!  Lots of variety in sweet and savory pastries and drinks, we got 2 Vietnamese pork buns, 1 kolache, 1 taco, 1 Nutella banana pastry and a cafe sua da for a total of $12!  Needless to say, it's now one our favorites and we'll definitely be regulars as there are still so many things to try! Delicious banana Nutella pastry!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"31 check-ins Shout out to this cool chill spot!!! Was the first customers of the day and the pastry was soo delicious. The smell of it when I opened the door hit me like a giant fluffy cloud with a hint of fresh hot coffee.  I had the vanilla honey and my wife had the creme brule and they both are flavorul drinks. The fact that they make their coffee with coffee beans from Texas coffee traders is what really drove me here. It's not a big spot but it a just the right size to enjoy some early or late coffee and a snack.  We ordered the sausage and cheese kolache and it couldn't be more fresh than that. They were still bringing out the goodies when we arrived so you can imagine th smell that filled the whole store and you couldn't resist but to try something. A nice thing is you can get a 25% discount if you go in with Yelp and show them.  You have definitely got to try it, you won't be disappointed. Their open every day. Just wish I went in the mornings to work a little later so I can grab me a cup of coffee during the week. Enjoy!!!",1
Coffee Shop 9,"13 check-ins Listed in Great Austin Coffee Houses The lowdown on this place is this:  the people who run it are bakers who own a catering business (they still do this) so this is why their cookies, pastries and kolaches are so great--they are baked in house fresh each day!  In addition to these homemade goodies they also sell other snacks like potato chips, chocolate covered raisins and pizza from East Side Pie.  They also serve bagels they get refrigerated in from Brooklyn, NY.  As for beverages:  their loose tea selection is pretty cool and they brew and sell Texas Coffee Traders coffee.  The vanilla they put in their lattes is Madagascar flavored and really great.  They have Wunder-Pliz kombucha on tap for all you kombucha folks.  In addition they have a cooler with soda and Topo Chico.    There is a ton of space here to get work done with fast wifi.  It is mostly table and chairs with one couch.  Lots of local art for sale dots the walls.  There are also a few outdoor seats.  Tons of parking spots.  After 5PM they sell all their pastries for $1.  Only catch is that this is dine in only.    I am so happy to have such a great local coffee shop in walking distance from my development where I live.  Here's to their success! New flavors of kolache Iced coffee Couch",1
Coffee Shop 9,Nice little place outside the city. Food was pretty good also. Definitely recommend!!,1
Coffee Shop 9,This place is awesome! Super cute on the inside and delicious food and coffee. I was getting my oil changed at the Hyundai at South Point and found this place on Yelp. Definitely worth the drive - the kolaches are amazing and I crave them all the time! They staff was wonderful too. They even have a little conference room in the back. So going back here!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"I went early on a Saturday morning. I ordered a regular latte and a chocolate 'croissant'. The service was prompt and friendly. The latte was very good, although nothing extraordinary. The croissant (really a pain au chocolat) was just below average, if you compare it to the real thing from France. They present themselves as a coffee shop with an in house bakery. I think the coffee is the better of the two. It was nice to have some outdoor seating. I would visit this place again, to try their Vietnamese iced coffee, but not until I finish exploring other cafes in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 9,We stopped by here for a pastry and coffee before starting our day in Austin. It's just around the corner from our AirBnB so it was very convenient. Ate my first kolache (sausage and cheddar) here and it was so delicious! We originally bought one to share but the boyfriend took one bite and told me to get my own. Lol. I washed it down with a white chocolate mocha which was yummy as well.,1
Coffee Shop 9,"Really great spot!    I haven't been on Oltorf east of 35 since college (nunnya business how long ago that was), but this is worth the skip over- it's just a quarter mile east of the freeway. Easy in and out, and a friendly staff to boot.  The jalapeño cheddar sausage kolache ($1.75) was awesome. Tried one, and then immediately bought another.  All their prices are very reasonable. Their cubano was really good as well.  I probably shoulda doubled up on that, too.  They also have a conference available if you need to have more of a business discussion. That's a great idea for small business owners and freelancers.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"What I look for most in a coffee shop is a good study environment, the right lighting and of course, good coffee.  This place has big tables, bright lights and the coffee was good!  I ordered a black eye with salted Caramel but I messed it up when I added vanilla almond milk, I should have known better!  My boyfriend got 2 jalepeno kolaches. He did find a hair baked into one of them but the guy at the front replaced it immediately. Hair happens ya know? My boyfs coffee was way better than mine. He got a vanilla latte and it was delicious. I will definitely go back to study here.  They even have a private room in the back! Jalepeno kolaches Vanilla latte Black eye with salted caramel and vanilla almond milk (I won't add almond milk next time)",1
Coffee Shop 9,"Although unsuspecting, this understated cafe is great.. This was my first time walking in and partaking (and I have lived and gone by this place many, many times) in the atmosphere.  Love the music selection, the atmosphere was nice and relaxing, the staff were super cool and friendly. Free wifi a big bonus. I came here to do some work. Much better than the Starbucks up the road. Less ""commercial"".  If you get a chance you've got to check this place out.",1
Coffee Shop 9,"So happy that I found such a cute coffee shop walking distance from my new apartment. Lots of space, would be great for studying. I had an iced chai latte that was delicious.  We were originally going there in search of sandwiches, but right now they don't have a chef, so we just got some chocolate croissants. I also noticed they had a few beers on tap which is something good to know.  I really hope more people find out about this place!!",1
Coffee Shop 9,The only reason this place gets four stars is that I can only enjoy it from the hours they are open instead of 24/6. This is a great study spot and is far enough from campus that it is not packed with students. The red couch eats you up once you sit down. Traps you there for optimal productivity. The kolaches were pretty tasty. Over all it is a great spot whether you want to just hang and enjoy some beverages or need to buckle down and get work down. Only wish it was open later. Maybe with a little more traffic this place can support longer hours. I highly recommend trying it out. Jalapeño cheese kolache on left regular on right. Carmel frap,1
Coffee Shop 9,16 check-ins Oh please let this stay open. I mean it would be nice to have other neighborhood coffee houses I can go to closeby. Their coffee is decent and the inside of the cafe is big. I had their coffee and it was good. They have free wifi and baked goods. Cafe Creme.,1
Coffee Shop 9,Love this place! The coffee is amazing and the Crepes are to die for.  So happy to have them in the neighborhood!,1
Coffee Shop 9,"2 check-ins Friendly, helpful, variety on the menu - Viet pork bun and iced French press were on point!",1
Coffee Shop 6,"30 check-ins What makes Brian's Brew special? The moon milk? The coffee? The fresh beans that arrive Tuesday and Wednesday? Or is it Sam. I offer to you fellow Yelp fans this- all the above. When you meet someone with a passion for what they do, add fresh spin and approach to coffee making you can't help but rave about Brian's Brew. In the morning get there early and enjoy the breakfast tacos before the building employees take advantage of this first floor coffee stop. Enjoy your morning greeting from Sam who provides that special touch transforming your morning cup of joe to a delightful coffee experience. Never have I described coffee the way I describe wine. This is an amazing stop and deserves to be shared and enjoyed. Take a walk over to the corner of 6th and Congress- enter into the mezzanine at the Bank of America building on the corner- put the Starbucks to your back and enjoy a coffee by Sam. Make sure to provide an email address and earn your stars for that future cup. I guarantee you will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 6,Great little spot to get good coffee at low price..nice selection of coffee and tea..,1
Coffee Shop 6,"The reviews have been right. It is so hidden but such a good latte the Summermoon.  Definitely worth it,  it is hidden though past security (you can just walk past)  behind the elevator. Very friendly server!",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Friendly people, delicious coffee in a hole in the wall inside BofA building. The moon milk was a bit over the top for me but I can see that a touch of it can be a nice treat. That said the local Roaster ""Summer Moon"" makes an excellent, well-balanced medium roast that is now in my suitcase! Looking forward to the morning. Thanks and see you next time!",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Brian's is in the Bank of America building, past the elevators and on your left. I'm a tea drinker and they serve Mighty Leaf tea, which is my favorite brand! They were so super friendly here that I recommend visiting them based solely on that!",1
Coffee Shop 6,Great little coffee shop tucked in back corner of Bank of America Center. Well worth the hunt - just don't show up around 7am as they typically open later,1
Coffee Shop 6,just go. get the summermoon. still thinking about that latte. a little hard to find at first but just go past the elevators :),1
Coffee Shop 6,"Nice guy!! If you are looking for summermoon's moon milk, then this is the place to go downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Yes, yes, yes. The Wintermoon (iced summermoon) is the best latte I've ever had. I can't even-  I loved it so much that I seriously considered doubling back and getting another one in the same cup after I finished it (refill style). I've never felt that way about a coffee beverage before. I like that it's not like a big chain and it's in a very corporate-feeling building. It's kind of like a small act of resistance to shop local while surrounded by such huge businesses. Anyway- if I'm downtown, this is the place I'd want to go. Despite being a gold status Starbucks cardholder/addict?  Friendly but not in that overwhelmingly-perky way (which, let's be real, too much perk is tricky when I've had too little coffee on a Monday). I'd definitely come back and recommend to friends. I know one in particular who'd love a ""Cold slap in the face"". It's a drink, and definitely ask about it when you're there :)",1
Coffee Shop 6,Not what you expect to find when you walk into the Bank of America building...worth the strange walk past the elevators though to find great coffee and super friendly service. Both the hot and iced coffees are great.,1
Coffee Shop 6,"Had the best latte of my life! That Summermoon is amazing. I typically like coffee and enjoy a good latte, but I LOVED this drink.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Just a small takeaway coffee bar, but the wood fire roast they use is fantastically smooth. Standard preparations (drip, espresso). The barista was friendly and knowledgeable. Americano was delicious.  I'd go back any time, but not for the ambiance.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Located in the Bank of America in Dowtown Austin, in the back if the lobby.  Brian not only owns the place, he is there making and serving your drinks.  Brian is really nice and even had suggestions where to eat.  There is something familiar about chains, that no matter where you are, you know what us in the menu.  But I'd rather patronize small independent coffee shops like this in trips (or even in my hometown) because it is a chance to meet local people and give back to the community.  If I am ever back in Austin, for whatever reason, I will definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 6,Amazeballs!!! The wintermoon is the bomb!! They make their own cream and it honestly tastes like heaven. The service was awesome! It's kind of in a weird spot. Right outside of jimmy John's in the Bank of America building past the elevators.,1
Coffee Shop 6,"I love to use Yelp when I visit other cities and I found this place as a result of trying to find a local coffee shop near my work office. Turns out, this was a great place!  The breakfast tacos were on point (seriously get the bacon, so good!) and I had a delicious vanilla-spicy chai (Or as chombo as my fave place in seattle calls it). Guy behind the counter had never heard of this, but now he knows it's totally a thing.  Definitely recommend, I wish I liked coffee more. I was super tempted to order the Summermoon but...blech, coffee is not a flavor i like. LoL",1
Coffee Shop 6,"As other reviews state, Brian is there making the coffee. Super nice guy executing a great idea...fire roasted coffee.  I just got a cup of drip to go, since there is no seating. Good equipment plus good beans yields good coffee. Not amazing coffee, but good coffee.  Probably return again this week. Give it a try.",1
Coffee Shop 6,Lived up to the ratings. Great coffee and great service! The cream and coffee combo in the summer moon latte was the perfect pick-me-up. It is worth the trip to the hidden location.,1
Coffee Shop 6,"Listed in Keep Austin Weird Wood fire roasted coffee?  Yeah, you definitely caught my attention.  It took me a little while to find this spot.  Fortunately, when you enter the Bank of America building on Congress there are helpful signs that direct you past the elevators and then to make a left.  There, sits Brian's proudly serving all the ticky -tackies (and they all look just the same)  I grabbed a double espresso and while I was disappointed that there was no demitasse, the product itself did not disappoint.  It was a smooth shot, reminiscent of an Italian espresso.  I think I actually got to speak with Brian or maybe he has a worker who looks just like the guy in the illustration.  He told me about how they choose a medium roast for their espresso and they feel the wood fire roasting is what develops the smoothness of the shot.  Clearly, they are also pulling it properly because as any coffee snob knows, even the greatest beans can be destroyed by poor technique.  The people who work in that building are very lucky to have such a dedicated purveyor on their first floor.  Of the coffee that I drank in Austin, this was some of the best.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"2 check-ins Brian is da man!  This small coffee dispensery is located inside the B of A building on Congress.  He(Brian) is an awesome guy to talk to and takes pride in his craft.  Their espresso beans are wood fire hand roasted locally and brew with an amazing crema layer....smooth.  I bring home a bag every visit to Austin.  I'm a fan of their half wintermoon which is Brian's concoction of milk with flavors.  It's between a white mocha and a latte so you still get the coffee flavor you deserve.  Good distribution of espresso between the three sizes.  12oz =1 shot, 16oz = 2 shots, 20oz = 3 shots.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Updated review Brian messaged me through Yelp explaining the situation of his reason for closing. I still have yet to try the coffee here, but Brian seems like a stand up guy about his business!  I would suggest checking his Website/Facebook for updated hours (not yelp's)",1
Coffee Shop 6,Girlfriend got the groupon here and so I tried the Mocha Moon Latte. I have to admit this place is definitely better than Starbucks. The Mocha flavor was strong and the cup was pretty sweet. Made perfectly that I didn't need to do anything else to it. Just the way I like it.  I didn't even notice that the logo was actually the guy behind the counter.. at least I hope it is. haha,1
Coffee Shop 6,"My Summermoon latte was quite good, flavorwise...though it is just short of cloyingly sweet.  It had an excellent dark/smoky flavor as an aftertaste, which was quite delightful and made me really wish I'd gotten just a straight-up latte because if that aftertaste came from the beans I need to go back and get myself a bag of them.  I'm definitely a fan of this place because I like good coffee, but microfoam is the second best part of a latte and I didn't notice any.  Before I ordered, I asked what the Summermoon tasted like, and was told something like ""pure deliciousness"" or ""pure awesomeness"".  It's a bit of a hard sell...how often do you buy something to eat when the person making it cannot tell you what it tastes like.  When he said it was the top seller, I decided to take the plunge.  Then it took a few minutes to mix up the milk in the back room, and I was told ""sorry, need to make more unicorn tears"" or somesuch.  Finally I got to taste it, and darn if I can't place the taste anyway...I can't describe it to you, so I'm not much surprised that he didn't describe it to me.  So it's not in the easiest location to get to, the drink has indescribable flavor, it took a while to make my drink, and I missed my foam, but that coffee tasted gooood...does the rest really matter so much?",1
Coffee Shop 6,"So I just strolled into work this morning, got everyone's full attention, and asked if I can sing praises from a mountaintop about how g damn great my morning coffee tastes.  I was walking by the BofA building, as I do every morning, and mused about how much I love the Brian's Brew sidewalk sign out, as I do every morning - only this time I decided it was time to duck in & give it a try.  HOLY HOLY HOLY YAY.    ONE TASTE YA'LL and I'm sold.  Forget the other couple of places down the way - they aight.  But Brian's Brew takes the cake.  Hands down.  It's the best.  Rich, nutty, bold, smokey - DANG.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Brian's Brew popped up on my radar recently, and I dropped by while running errands one morning. I had no idea it was tucked into a nook in the Bank of America Center. For those running around downtown, it is conveniently located in a busy area.  Who would not like a nice fire-roasted cup of Summermoon Coffee alongside some other baked goods--from Round Rock donuts, Rock Star, and Bakerman's? My coffee and 3 small breakfast staples ran me just $4.50.  For a locally owned coffee shop in a very corporate-driven building, check out BB. You will not be disappointed, and the guy really takes care of you here. Is his name Brian? Hopefully he can fight the good fight while charging so little for some quality selections.",1
Coffee Shop 6,This place is awesome! I've been going to Brian's Brew for about a year now and just sad that I no longer work downtown to get my summermoon latte!,1
Coffee Shop 6,"Damn fine espresso. Crema was a little weak but it was served in a big cup. But the flavor... oh the flavor! Wood fired roasted, need I say more. Try it. Sip it. Savor it. Love it.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"It's the best coffee within walking distance of downtown offices, delivered swiftly by a polite staff.  It's not magical, but when something's the best at what it does, it should get five stars.",1
Coffee Shop 6,Had coffee from the self-self machine and wintermoon latte - both very good and above average coffee. Definitely will be coming back a lot.,1
Coffee Shop 6,"I was going to get a Starbucks, but went to the ATM first... There, I saw the coffee shop sign and decided to get a latte there instead. Oh boy! That was the right decision. Brian was so nice and the Mocha Latte suuuper delicious... He told me it was the best mocha in town. He was right.",1
Coffee Shop 6,I love this hidden gem! The lattes here are amazing! Hot and cold. I come here as often as I can. It's nice to have a place that's not over-rated and commercialized like Starbucks. The Summermoon and Wintermoon lattes are to die for.,1
Coffee Shop 6,"The mocha I had today was phenomenal. It's an office-based coffee service window, so don't expect a sit-down shop. Nonetheless, it is worth your time and effort. I didn't think that I would be able to distinguish the difference with the ""wood-fired"" roast. I was wrong. The mocha was the best",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Brian is the man.  He is congenial, polite, and skilled at his craft.  He is the kind of shop owner who remembers his regulars and the level of service is consistently rockstar.  The wood-fire coffee is rich, smoky, and roasted by an individual with an appreciation for the subtle complexity of coffee.  His prepared drinks are unique and delicious.  Try the summermoon latte and the espresso milkshake.  You can't go wrong with either.  Beyond the quality of his eponymous brew, Brian purveys the culinary highlights of Austin.  Round Rock Donuts, Torchy's Tacos, and Eastside Pies all in one place--no where else downtown can you find such variety.  Give Brian a shot, his shop is a hidden gem of what Austin is all about.",1
Coffee Shop 6,Really friendly spot that no one knows about!!!,1
Coffee Shop 6,Listed in Austin Intention Hey Brian- Good going on this one. I stopped in while running errands and thought I'd try wood fired coffee. I really enjoyed it.,1
Coffee Shop 6,Brian is great. Tasty shakes. Delectable cold brewed espresso. I'm always in a good mood after Brian's Brew.,1
Coffee Shop 6,"Tried almost every other coffee downtown before finally giving the guy with the quirky sidewalk sign a shot. This is the best coffee downtown, and possibly the best latte I've ever had. Smooth, rich, delicious. The donuts aren't his, but are also amazing.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Pretty darn good coffee... I had the drip, Honduras it was called... added some stevia and a little creamer... it didn't need anything else, wasn't bitter, very tasty coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"Coffee is good, but the service is what keeps me coming back. Lovely guy.",1
Coffee Shop 6,Brian is a great guy and his brew is the best in dt!! Today I stopped in to try the mocha latta and it was much better then starbucks!! Thanks Brian!,1
Coffee Shop 6,"Seriously had the best coffee of my life, the Wintermoon Latte....yummmmm!! On top of the great coffee, Brian was super nice!  I'll be back next time I'm in Austin, unless you decide to open a location in Dallas!",1
Coffee Shop 6,"First to Review WOW!!!! I work off of congress and I stopped by brians brew to try their ""wood fire coffee"" and I had the best iced latte I have ever had in my life. I believe it was called the ""winter moon"". I think it actually changed my life as the logo says. I am never going to Starbucks again as long as that little store stays open",1
Coffee Shop 6,"I practically live off the Summermoon latte, this place seriously has some of the best coffee in Austin. Brian is a good guy, always friendly service.",1
Coffee Shop 6,"I had the summer moon latte this morning... it was excellent ( very sweet like i like it)  and the service was also great! i like the way they say small instead of ""tall' that really annoys me... i think i found my new ""go-to"" morning coffee spot",1
Coffee Shop 6,Went to Brians for the first time yesterday. The winter moon latte was AMAZING! They recommended it to me instead of my usual vanilla latte. I'll definitely be going back!,1
Coffee Shop 6,"Yup. The reviews are spot on. This place lives up to the five star Yelp rating, fo' sho'. In need of some really good coffee, I walked over to this place to try it out. I wanted a Round Rock donut, too, I won't lie. Having those things a mere three blocks from my office is a dangerous thing...  I walked up and, other than a couple of guys who were just picking up their coffee to leave, there wasn't anyone in line. I ordered a 1/2 sweet Summermoon Latte and grabbed an oatmeal from the counter (totally forgot about the Round Rock donut... damn). The guy, who I assume was Brian, was friendly and worked quickly. The latte was delicious! So smooth, and even though it was the 1/2 sweet one, it was plenty sweet for me. I'm anxious to try the drip coffee, and I saw some coffee in mason jars... did I hear him say those were cold brewed? That might be good to take home to have on the weekends. Anyway, definitely try this place. You won't be disappointed. The building is caddie corner to Starbucks, so its not far out of the way if that's where you're headed. Plus, it kinda puts Starbucks to shame.",1
Coffee Shop 40,"Excellent coffee in an adorable little wooden trailer. Enjoy while you wait for Franklins. And if you're from the Bay Area or Santa Cruz, you'll be pleased to know the person who sources their beans worked previously for Verve. They know what they're doing!  We ordered cortados and a pumpkin scone. Both highly recommended.",1
Coffee Shop 40,"I really loved this place! Tucked right behind Franklin's, Legend Coffee Company is situated in a cozy trailer/truck house. When we were there, everything was ran by one person....I feel bad for not catching her name but she was a true magician, creating exceptional concoctions.  Even though it wasn't on the menu, I had heard wonderful things about The Queen Bee: espresso, honey, milk, and coconut oil. Never realized all of my favorite things could go together! Talk about a drink with multiple layers of flavor: slightly sweet, creamy, and a tad savory. Like woaaaaaaaa!  Quality coffee, amazing customer service, talented baristas...this is THE place to check out! I promise that you won't be disappointed and you are in for a treat! Specials listed The Queen Bee - espresso, milk, honey, and coconut oil",1
Coffee Shop 40,"If you are the kind of person who will get to Franklin Barbecue hours early, this little coffee stand will be a blessing to you.  It is very conveniently located behind this famous eating spot.  And even if you're not around for meat, the coffee is worth stopping all on it's own.  The deluxe mocha is lightly sweet almost like a hot chocolate which I personally liked.  The Cassandra (a honey cinnamon latte) is actually surprisingly nutty which I also enjoyed.  Also it helps that the people running the place are really nice.",1
Coffee Shop 40,"I can't get enough of all the food trucks in Austin. Each one has such personality - some are air streamers, some are buses, some look like little houses on wheels. The only thing they have in common is that they are on wheels and that they are uniquely decorated to the whim of the owner of the truck. I love that.  Legend Coffee, is no exception. Parked behind Franklin BBQ on an unpaved yard, is this tiny little house on wheels. It's made entirely of wooden slats, complete with a 3 tiered roof, and a tiny cut out window where the barista works gracefully as if this were her own home.  The people in Austin do not rush you. They let you take your time, examine all the different types of beverages they offer, before gently nudging you to order. There probably isn't a huge line in front of you and probably not a huge line behind you. And, if there is, people are quite chilled out about it. I think that affects how a beverage is made. Because the cortado that I ordered was one of the most delicious coffee drinks I've ever had.  The Queen Bee Cortado piqued my interest, an espresso with steamed milk, honey, and coconut oil. I've never had coconut oil in my coffee before, but let me tell you, it was delicious. It smelled better than any coffee I've ever had. Coffee with honey and milk you can probably imagine, but the full bodied finish of coconut oil in the end, that just give it a third texture, smell, and dimension that I didn't expect but ended up savoring. I highly recommend it and wish I had a cup right now. today's specials Legend Coffee's adorable food truck house longhorn",1
Coffee Shop 40,"If I'm being honest, I would have to admit that I'm not a big coffee drinker...and when I do drink it it's typically Starbucks. Today, I though I decided to try something new and check out this coffee shop while waiting in line for some BBQ. I quite happy I did! My mocha deluxe was pretty awesome. It was made with sea salt and cinnamon but not too much. This has definitely made the wait for Franklin's much more bearable. The menu Mocha deluxe so good!",1
Coffee Shop 40,"Love Legend coffee! It is delicious, fresh, and hand crafted. It is clear the team takes pride and joy in what they do. I really feel cared for and listened to when I go! Great to grab a cup pre Franklins or on a Sunday morning on the way to he farmers market!  My only wish is that they had skim milk, but I am willing to make the sacrifice for this beautiful coffee! Legend coffee and the green belt= perfect Sunday",1
Coffee Shop 40,"Wow. I am so happy to have found this place (waiting for Franklins) i'm glad that I live just up the street. The Queen Bee Cortado  was the perfect combo of creamy, sweet, savory- it's honey, milk, and coconut oil (in espresso). Cute truck too. I'm now obsessed. Thanks. Adorable logo too. Queen Bee Cortado",1
Coffee Shop 40,"Let's keep this short and sweet: these guys know coffee.  They are poised right behind Franklin's BBQ and serve some amazing tasting and really inexpensive coffee. They have fancy things like a cayenne cinnamon hot chocolate, different daily baked goods and bags of coffee beans, but the regular hand poured coffee was spectacular!  They use an Ethiopian roast that smells intoxicating, especially in the cold. Have it black, or visit the table a few steps away for cream and syrup (in a bourbon bottle, I like their style).  All in all, super highly recommended. I wish they were down in Miami, I'd drink this everyday!",1
Coffee Shop 40,"I've walked my dogs past this place forever but always forget to bring $ with me--so glad I finally did. I'm not real big on hot coffee so I got their City Slicker--cold brew with vanilla and cream--and it was great! I'm now a repeat customer. Also got a scone once before the pastries ran out, and I look forward to more of those as well. Not too sweet either, which I like. I think they get a lot of business from the line at Franklin's, but it would be a great place to stop on your way to work, as there are places to park and you can dash in and out (but they don't open till 8am).",1
Coffee Shop 40,Listed in Favorite Coffee Shops Such a cool little place tucked away behind Franklin's BBQ! The lady was so friendly! I tried their cold brew iced coffee and I loved it! It was so smooth and not bitter! Will totally come back here! Cold brew!,1
Coffee Shop 40,"She's a sweetheart. Went out of her way to make something amazing for me. I consider myself a coffee shop. They did not meet my expectations... they exceeded them. Definitely ask for Annie, she has mad skill.",1
Coffee Shop 40,"Such an adorable trailer! Their bread and butter are line-sufferers at Franklin's BBQ, but I come here because their coffee is simply delish! I really like the Cassandra latte with honey and cinnamon-- perfect for a cold(ish) Austin winter day! Fast service, nearby parking, and easy for a quick trip on the way to work!",1
Coffee Shop 40,"In Austin for a workshop, and stopped for a latte here. Honey and cinnamon in a very round, full, comforting, soft, flavorful (not sharp or bitter) espresso. So yummy! And the barista was friendly. Nice experience!",1
Coffee Shop 40,This place was such a gem! Great tasting coffee and the owner was super friendly!! It's all about the Cassandra! Way better than any chain coffee place! This was such a great find! Was getting ready to go wait in line at franklins and stumbled upon this place! Best logo ever!! Also the Cassandra was amazing! You need to get it!,1
Coffee Shop 40,"17 check-ins Never mind the chain coffee shops! Support your local coffer house... or trailer! Tucked away behind Franklin BBQ, this hand built wooden trailer is cranking out some serious grinds. Tea, cold brew, espresso, you name it. The quality is very high and you can taste it with every sip. If you're planning on standing in line for BBQ, grab a cup of coffee to start the morning off on the right foot.",1
Coffee Shop 40,Great little coffee spot behind Franklin BBQ the owner was really nice guy also serves great pastries,1
Coffee Shop 40,"Mhhhh their queen bee cortado! Delicious. Honey, steamed milk, espresso. The touch of coconut oil really makes it.  Came back for seconds to try the cinnamon honey latte, also pretty deliciously satisfying.  Plus, it's the cutest little coffee truck I've ever seen. Beware, it's behind Franklins BBQ so parking sometimes is packed. Worth driving around to snag a spot though.",1
Coffee Shop 40,"I love a good coffee so came over to try their cold brew. They had a special called the city slicker which is their cold brew, vanilla, and cream so I got one for each my hubby and I. It was delicious- good coffee flavor and the vanilla really complimented it! Definitely give it a try. Such a great set up outside too! Love the food truck style!",1
Coffee Shop 40,Good coffee and a saving grace for those who are enduring the long wait at Franklin's.  Cute setup with seats too!,1
Coffee Shop 40,"First to Review A perfectly placed coffee cart to keep smiles going and eyes open when committing to the Franklin BBQ Line.  As I was already bouncing uncontrollably from the frigid temps, I swapped my usual morning latte for the Chai.  The spicy sweetness warmed me up and lifted my spirits to carry me through to the final destination of the Franklin cashier.    Even though we brought mimosas for our midday beverages, the ideal choice would have been to bring a bottle of bourbon to top off the available supply of warm milky beverages from Legend Coffee Co.  Next time!",1
Coffee Shop 40,"This is a hand crafted wooden trailer behind Franklins BBQ. There is parking in front of it or on the street. I've had both the mocha and Cassandra lattes. Both delicious on the own, but the Cassandra is a cinnamon/honey flavor latte. I've never had that combination before in a coffee and was quite surprised how delicious it is. The entire drink is made in front of you, including the milling of cinnamon. It is tasty, frothy and with the right amount of sweetness to bring it all together.",1
Coffee Shop 40,They know what they are doing.....small food truck like place behind a BBQ joint....Definitely recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 40,"Tasty, tasty, tasty.  Highly recommend the hibiscus cooler thing. The trailer itself is a sight to see with every detail right down to the tip collector carefully thought out.  Perfect location right behind Franklin BBQ, best kept secret of the bbq line....",1
Coffee Shop 40,"Very friendly service. Tucked in the back of Franklin's barbecue. They provide warm, hot drinks while you wait in line for your lunch. I ordered a chai latte and it was not to sweet how I like it. It wasn't too hot were I couldn't drink it for awhile, just the right temperature for me to keep me warm inside. Since its tucked in a place were no one can see it, I hope word gets out to get this place rollin'. Making my chai latte",1
Coffee Shop 40,"waiting in line for Franklin BBQ in 35 degree weather isnt very fun, but when the kind folks at Franklin mentioned that Legend Coffee was open for business in the Franklin BBQ parking lot, i was all about getting a nice, hot drink haha. they have a good spot for anyone waiting in line for BBQ, but other than that it is hard to spot their trailer so hopefully the line foot traffic and word of mouth  is enough to keep them in business b/c their coffee is good!! i'm a sucker for a good pour over cup of coffee so that's exactly what i ordered. at $3, i thought it was really affordable too. Heck at starbucks their coffee is already $2 a cup so i'll pay that extra money for a freshly brewed cup haha. its pretty cool how they have an entire coffee shop set-up in a trailer - they have all the fancy equipment to make you a mocha, espresso, or latte if thats your drink of choice too. huge selection of tea for the non-coffee drinkers out there and they do offer a small selection of pastries if you need a snack while you wait. the service was super friendly as well. i hope that Legend Coffee does well! Pour over coffee",1
Coffee Shop 40,"I would think that without the steady flow of caffeine- hungry  Franklin's patrons lined up at 9am this place would not be so popular.  The coffee tastes like it is brewed in a loaf of rye bread, which I love but not in a hot cup of coffee.  Maybe they are trying to ride out the current beard loving,  whiskey drinking, lumber sexual trend. Personally, when I want coffee, rye whiskey is not the flavor profile I am craving.  The Columbia brew was harsh in all the wrong places. Maybe this batch was burned (though I hope they would have recognized this) or maybe the Ethiopian blend is better but even on a cold February morning I couldn't finish 16 ounces. Two stars for providing me with an expensive hardwarmer-- and the barista was friendly.",0
Coffee Shop 40,Get the iced Cassandra!!!!  I could drink one everyday.  Probably my favorite coffee drink ever.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place looks very unassuming on the outside but its a very nice, quaint transport to a world of awesomeness. It's definitely a place I can see an Austinite sitting down on any given day to work at a cafe.  The owners are really nice charming people, knowledgeable and passionate about their gelato, knowing how to appeal to the italian roots they're proud of in their gelato as well as tastes for the american palate.  That said, EVERYTHING I tried was off the charts amazing in flavor. Smooth, velvety gelato that's not too sweet, with fresh cream and fruit flavor (for the fruity ones). I think particularly noteworthy are the cannoli and stracciatella - the stracciatella as an all around favorite for our group and the cannoli has bold vibrant flavor. I personally liked the cherry as well - tasted sweet, like fresh picked fruit. Cream cake is also good if you're into that kinda thing. And though the cheesecake looks very fruity and you'd imagine denseness, its very light and comes off the palate with a very clean cheesecake flavor (the fruit compote type jam on top helps cut the richness I guess).  All in all, you can get a cup of happiness for not that much more than any other ice cream shop in town and you clearly can't go wrong, so come on by.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Mmmm the gelato is so tasty! I came here for a dessert date and had the Tequila flavor with lime and blackberries. It was very fresh and had a teeny tiny taste of tequila in it. I would love to come back and try some of the other flavors and baked goods.  The inside was very clean and stylish. Only downside was a small parking lot and lacking in outdoor seating. Also, it'd be nice to have more variety in coffee. Other than that I like this cute cafe!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"If you're looking for a relaxing European coffee shop experience in the midst of a an increasingly boxy South Lamar--here is your oasis! This gorgeous little Italian cafe and gelato shop.  Operated by a delightful couple of folks (the gentleman can whistle like a Disney bluebird!), this place has coffee that tastes like you're on vacation and treats that are flaky and scrumptious. The ambiance is as balanced and sweet as the gelato. This place will chill you out and improve your afternoon. It's worth a little splurge for a Perfect 10 cafe! Cheesecake gelato and also a Coffee-type that was seriously so insanely DELICIOUSAAAAAA. Treats and Gelato",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Cute little shop run by a gorgeoussssss couple. I mainly came here to try their gelato donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family, so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime, which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate.  The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes, but mine was filled with vanilla gelato on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the experience, but the taste of it was only decent. The gelato filling is kind of melted and frothy, which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything, I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise, I'd stick to their regular gelato selections.  My mom and older brother both got gelato cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia, which is the very liquid, smooth and creamy, dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their cheesecake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach gelato. Cappuccino is delish too. Just get everything. ;)  Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left, but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here. Next time, I'm having my eyes set on their coffee and more gelato cups. Display case. Beautiful gelato flavors!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I don't know. There seems to be another gelato place here in south Austin popping up with a few more. I'm pretty sure we will see a season of Gelato Wars on TV or in the newspaper. I have to admit though I don't know what is good gelato or bad gelato. As long as it doesn't make me sick, I'm fine with it.  I see photos on yelp for gelato shaped like donuts. Immediately I must go and check them out. Luckily they had a banner which said GELATO out in front otherwise I would have been wandering up and down Lamar looking for this place. The parking lot is small and space is very limited. Once you get inside, it's a cute, modern cafe with one case full of the gelato donuts, cake and tiramisu. There's another case full of the gelato. You can ask for a sampling of the gelato and I had the cookies and cream with cappuccino. As a result, it was pretty good gelato. Strachelli and cappucino Tiramisu and donut shaped gelato",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Great Gelato and friendly service. Dangerous that this place is almost within walking distance. My GF got the stracciatella and said it was just like the kind she used to get when living in Rome (she hasn't been able to find any like it since getting back to Texas). The gentleman that served us also mentioned that they will soon have fresh house made cannoli which are one or my guilty dessert pleasures, so we will definitely be back very soon.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Food: 5.0 of 5.0 Service: 5.0 of 5.0 Environment: 5.0 of 5.0  Great tasting Gelato at an expected expensive price. This place would be a nice place to take a date on after the movies or eating downtown. Service is very polite and patient. Inside!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Venezia Italian Gelato is run by an Italian couple. I had a moment to converse with the owner (the kind lady) and she was so sweet. She works practically all day--wakes up bright and early to make the gelato and service her customers.  I got the 2 scoops of gelato for $4, which isn't bad. I had the hazelnut and peach gelato. The peach was very peachy (duh, right?)--it didn't taste artificial or bland. It has a hint of sourness, but a great flavor for a hot summer day.  They only allow you to try 2 samples and ask that you keep your spoons for environment's sake, which I fully appreciate. Overall, I'll give this place 3 stars + 1 star for the lady's service. The decor was nice, definitely a great study spot.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Ahhh gelato. Takes me back to summers in Germany, and traveling the canals of Venice. There is something so delicate about the flavors, compared to ice cream.  Venezia Gelato does not disappoint when it comes to bringing that delicacy from Europe. A small with 2 flavor choices is about $4.50, with a medium being 3 choices for .50 cents more. Quite the steal compared to other speciality ice cream in Austin.  However, I'm floored at the interior of the shop. Ultra modern, with everything in black and white. Large windows face Lamar, and Mom's Tattoos. It's very clean, and neat, with some relaxing music playing in the background.  Obviously a family affair, they greet more family who shows up in support. Out of the 3 flavors I tried, cappachino, pecan and hazelnut... The hazelnut was my favorite. Will be back to try new combos! My ice! Beautifully displayed Lovely selections",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Ice cream donuts? Yes, it is true! They make donut shaped Gelato goodness and I am not sure what the outer coating is but I think just cream/sugar/yogurt and the inside is filled with gelato. We visited here the other night and my husband ordered THREE - he just could not stop eating them. I had a couple samples and ordered the vanilla and chocolate, so original I know, but they were good. I am used to the type of gelato that is more icy and not so creamy, but this is still good.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I have definitely been on a gelato craze, so I was happy to discover a new spot sort of close to home! The parking lot is kind of small / hard to navigate through, so it would be best to try to go during non-peak hours or after the business next door is closed for the day! (they have about 3 or so spots reserved for that business).  The decor is absolutely beautiful! I loved the black and white theme, if I hadn't decided to stop using snapchat, I would have been snapchatting very inch of this shop. Even the gelato was beautiful! But let's move on to the flavors...  I ended up ordering a small with mint & apple cinnamon. The flavor choices I picked were probably not the best combination wise, but they were both so good, I couldn't resist. My partner ordered a small with cherry & passionfruit. I thought the coffee flavor was great, but I was so insistent on the apple cinnamon, I chose to forgo that since THAT flavor combination would've been even more weird! Overall, I thought each flavor I sampled was great, it was a matter of which flavor I wanted. The biggest thing I noticed about the gelato was how light/icey it was. I've seen to grown to like more creamy textures, so I was a little sad when it wasn't as creamy. However, I would come back & recommend others to check it out! Small mint & apple cinnamon, small cherry & passionfruit",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Came with my friend 10 days after they opened.  First impressions: lots of seating, very beautiful decor.  Their gelato was pretty good. 4/5 stars because comparatively to other places in Austin, I wasn't blown away.  Their mint gelato was REALLY good, however. Exceptionally.  Because of their ample space, would be great for large groups of friends to hang and enjoy some gelato. Good selection",1
Coffee Shop 75,"My friends LOOOOOOVE this place. They come here once a week.  I thought it was very good & the owner looked very nice.  Cherry cheesecake was good-- looked amazing with graham crust crumbles on top. I thought it could use a little more cream cheese but that's just me. Passion fruit was really good-- tart & rich. The hazelnut chocolate is suuuuuuper rich and delicious but maybe too rich for most people.  This is a good, safe place to get gelato. They have flavors that are very typical for most Americans (""donuts"" ""vanilla"" ""coffee"" ""mint"" ""chocolate coconut"" and have a few exotic flavors ""passion fruit""",1
Coffee Shop 75,"There is a lot of hoopla about gelato places in Austin and I just haven't seen what all of the fuss is about. Most of them don't offer what I consider real gelato. Venezia is in a league far above the rest.  Nicola and Alice are not only awesome people (Nicola in particular also has a great handshake), but they're slinging some awesome gelato too and the clear best in Austin in my opinion. It's even as good as what I've had in Venice, Italy where they hail from. They have genuine passion for what their creating here that you can easily tell and taste.  I first came over a month ago and last came a week ago and see they are getting busier and busier which I love. I plan on coming much more. I'm a big fan of their espresso too. There is now real gelato in Austin to enjoy! Ben fatto!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Simply awesome. This is the place for gelato. When I was in Austin I was a regular here. Neat and clean decor, very nice people and the mix 2,3 scoops options are really good. All gelatos are made from scratch and u can feel the freshness in the flavor. We had capuchhinos as well. Everything is just perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Omg this place is so awesome and the gelato is DELISH!!! I have a dairy and gluten allergy and had me covered! The gelatin was definitely the BEST in town. Super fluffy and smooth! I Highly Recommend this place! The owner is from Italy too! He knows his stuff. From Italian to Italian this is the BEST place for gelato in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Ooh talk about authenticity! The Italian couple who opened this moved from their home about a year or so ago. Love the store layout and the gelato (please do not call it icecream) is so pleasing to the eye! They also have vegan flavors. Got the dark chocolate along with raspberry - both were vegan (I'm not vegan but it works in my favour since I'm mildly lactose intolerant) but man oh man, you cannot tell it apart from dairy ones. This has to be THE best dark chocolate gelato (or uh, ice cream) I've ever had in the world.  Owner and the employee are very friendly and nice to talk to as well. Going to keep coming back for it! What a yummy display. Sadly we didn't have tummy space for this.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"After a lousy day, I wanted to bring my wife here as a little treat.  I'd read the great reviews and was hopeful they'd have some great gelato, and we weren't disappointed.   We tried a few samples of flavors including cheesecake and passionfruit and everything was tasty.   In the end we both went with pistachio and cherry which was made with a tart Italian cherry and was absolutely delicious.  The pistachio was nicely rich and nutty with real pistachios and not the fake green dyed atrocity you find at a lot of places.  I got a macchiato to go along with the gelatos and it was rich, roasty, and really went well with the gelato.  The owners were both very friendly and I wish them lots of success here.  We at least will definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Listed in 100 in 2016 It's such a pleasure stumbling upon delightful little local places! Venezia was one of those stumbles.  Decent parking for it's S. Lamar location and spectacularly clean on the inside, I had high hopes from the moment I walked in. The woman at the front greeted me with a huge smile immediately and made me feel welcomed and wanted. She patiently waited as I decided what to order. Great customer service! Venezia serves up various flavors of handmade gelato and coffee. I stuck with the Gelato this time around, but would love to try their coffee too.  A small gelato gets you two decent sized scoops for  $4. The best part is that you can choose two different flavors, even with a small order. I ordered the cheesecake flavor and the chocolate biscuit flavor. Both were amazing! The gelato was perfectly creamy and each flavor was strong and distinct. I also tried the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip which were equally amazing.  I recommend coming here for a tasty pick-me-up. You won't be disappointed by the exceptional customer service or the amazing gelato!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Yummy yummy Gelato!!!!!  We drive through S. Lamar quite a bit and every time we pass this place I always say ""I want to go there."" Well we finally got the chance to and our experience was amazing!  We both have had gelato before. L.C. had it in Italy and myself in Hawaii (lol lame, I know). But the owner of the place is so so so sweet, and so welcoming. Educating us about gelato, the flavors, and how he makes them daily. We love to see people passionate about their businesses. Especially L.C. he loves conversation!  A tip: you can taste 2 different flavors at one time to see if they combine well! We got a kick out of that.  The sizes are small (2), medium (3), large (4), and they refer to how many scoops you desire. We both got mediums. They are open late too so perfect for after dinner! The flavors we liked were chocolate coconut, pistachio, cappuccino, black biscuit (Oreo), hazelnut, & mint.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"nice sweet treat. a little pricey 4 dollars for 2 scoop of ice-cream on the cone, but they are organic ice-cream, clean and no chemical which is a plus..  I love hazelnut favor. yum....",1
Coffee Shop 75,"My friends told me this was _the best_ and they weren't lying! This is my new favorite dairy treat spot in the entire city.  Venezia is a welcome addition. I'm a sugar snob, and I take my ice cream products seriously. I've had gelato everywhere from Rome to Richardson, and this is by far the best. Creamy and delicate, every bite was amazing. The flavors were the typical gelato flavors (hazelnut, pistachio,) with some extras thrown in (cookies and cream, strawberry cheesecake) and three vegan flavors for about 12 to 15 flavors to choose from.  I couldn't decide and had strawberry cheesecake and cherry. Both were rich and tasted so FRESH. It was like they had made it right in front of me (they didn't, but you could have fooled me). The service was super-friendly as well.  I highly recommend this place; just be sure to leave me a parking spot.",1
Coffee Shop 75,I have been DROOLING over the photos of the Mr. Ring for a few days now. I FINALLY got to try their gelato and Mr. Ring...  OH. MY. GOSH. It was delicious. I finished my Mr. Ring before I even left the parking lot! I love gelato and I love chocolate covered anything...so this is the perfect marriage of my 2 favorite things.  I sampled some of their gelatos and they were so delicious! The pineapple gelato is dairy free and tastes like I'm eating a pineapple! YAS.  What's even more awesome about this place is that their gelato is non-GMO and artificial color free! WOO HOO. I'm a total convert. I'll be walking over here so I can eat one Mr. Ring there and eat one on my walk home.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Awesome addition to the growing South Lamar food scene and a great dessert or decadent snack option. Authentic gelato with creative and sophisticated flavors with the added bonus of luscious Italian pastries and exquisite coffee.  Even a modest selection of gourmet sandwiches. Great vibe, upscale decor and gracious owners/hosts.  I've had gelato in Italy and this is the real deal.  Easy to miss if you are not watching for it--almost across the street from Snooze.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Updated review Wonderful experience of incredible gelato. Clean environment with plenty of seating and amazing selection of flavors and combinations.  Owners offered tastings of any of the selections and I ended up Peanut and Dark Chocolate.  Tiramisu and cheesecake are also popular items.  Highly recommend trying this out!  Get the Venezia flavor.....absolutely the BEST,1
Coffee Shop 75,it's simply amazing. the gelato is the best I have ever tasted. one of the best places to eat gelato in Austin. also owners are super sweet.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Updated review Awesome gelato !! Love the place, the flavors! Best gelato in Austin. Period. Chatted with the Italian owner. She's super knowledgable about heathy eating and why gelato is better that ice-cream. Definitely coming back many times. Awesome !",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I'm joining the chorus to say that Venezia is fantastic! Everything about my pop-in for a gelato on a sweltering summer afternoon felt authentically Italian. The proprietor is friendly and proud of his offerings, the flavors are familiar and yet somehow elevated, and the store is modern, spotlessly clean, and surprisingly large.  I went for a traditional pistachio and hazelnut for my first visit while my friend opted for two fruit flavors. All were so delicious that we were plotting our return trip before we left the store.  I want to tell everyone about Venezia because it may be a little less showy than some of its counterparts around town, but it is damn fine gelato. The real deal.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Love love loveeee this place!! I'm glad I found this new hole in the wall. It's easy to miss this place and turning into it is kind of hard -- but I assure ya it's worth it. I've tried other flavored but I ALWAYS get black cherry and passion fruit. You get two scoops for a small size so you can pick 2 flavors,1
Coffee Shop 75,Excellent- highly recommend. Most authentic gelato eatery in Austin not to mention a welcoming staff and fantastic ever changing flavors! A must try !,1
Coffee Shop 75,"After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety are exceptional...to say they are incredibly delicious is such an understatement!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the owners have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,Stopped in after dinner with a few friends for something sweet. Glad we did! Really enjoyed the dark chocolate and mint gelato combo I created. My friend had the pistachio and it was gone before I could even try it! Tutto perfetto.,1
Coffee Shop 75,This place was authentic. Very very very clean. Highly recommend to at least try it. 2 free samples are given. It was delicious to say the least.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Excellent gelato, espresso and owners. It's as authentic as you can get in Texas. Loved my first time there and excited to go back.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"3 check-ins My wife and I met Alice the owner, and we were welcomed in a very friendly manner.  The owners are brand new here; they came here straight from Italy so you know this is the real deal.  Compared to the other gelato places in Austin, this place's flavors are lighter but still taste very desserty.  The consistency is more like ice cream -- but healthier I guess? Right?  You must come here nowwwwww.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I've been trying to decide whether or not I should keep this place a secret. But I want them to do well and figured, I shouldn't be selfish. So here I am writing a review for the best gelato I have ever had.  Venezia is located off of South Lamar, right next to a tattoo shop, and if you blink, you might miss it. It doesn't have flashing lights waving you down saying ""THE BEST GELATO HERE"" but it does have the Italian flag, which pretty much says they're legit, no?  Upon walking in, we were greeted straight away with warm smiles. The owners are so sweet and friendly, and that made my whole experience that much better. The wife took care of us, allowing us to sample whatever we pleased. I tried the Passion Fruit, to which she made sure I understood to try the whole sample at a time, so that all 3 layers of flavors would mix together. And boy was she right. As soon as I took the entire sample, my eyes grew bigger and she could see that I was amazed! It was so delicious, words can't even begin to describe it.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Hazelnut and Passion fruit gelato. No regrets there.  The decor inside is cute and simple and if I could, I would live here. When we left, the owners said their thank yous and I quote, ""ciao"", still with smiles on their faces. It was 10 minutes before their closing time, and they still had a positive attitude.  From the moment we stepped foot into the place to the moment we stepped out, they were welcoming and I can't rave enough about the service here. The gelato was fantastic but the experience was even better.  I want this place to stay open for a while and possibly for forever. I want this husband and wife duo to succeed, so go. Go out and support this business, because I have never felt so much love for and from a place before. Passion fruit on top and hazelnut at the bottom",1
Coffee Shop 75,Amazingly perfect! The inside ambience and the people makes it a must visit place. I read the online review and went there to get Mr.Ring! The owners gave me a warm welcome and they offered to decorate the Ring for the occasion.  Service was one of the best. The owner also offered me few flavors of Gelato to try (even though he knows i was not there to buy gelato). The flavoring was top notch.  Will be definitely back to try their coffee range and buy more Mr.Rings and gelato! Best place to hangout.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the Ferrero Rocher gelato. I had it served with one scoop of the coffee flavor in a medium cup, where I quickly ate up the coffee just so I can savor the Ferrero Rocher. It was total bliss and I was immediately saddened that I didn't go up one size.  The amiable Italian owner added an even sweeter impression to our first visit. We asked him about the Tiramisu and even though my boyfriend didn't understand his accent, he was sold by the man's passionate description and tried it out.  I didn't even bother to try the Tiramisu, nor the Mr. Ring's (gelato donuts) which I originally went in for, after sampling the gelato. I'm now on a mission to find a gelato place in Houston that tastes as good, if not, I'll be coming back real soon!",1
Coffee Shop 75,I have been looking for a gelato cafe for a while and I found it. This is my favorite place for Gelato! The Ferrero Rocher gelato is wonderful. The people working there are very nice and the cafe is very clean,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Updated review 2 check-ins I was literally in love with this place. I had admired their selection and ambience. My last experience white washed all of it. The male owner was so rude and that you could feel it in his tone. His words we sharp n pinching. I received a response from him and that too was full of arrogance!! I respect rules and policies of the businesses but there is something called as customer service and politeness which is almost non existent here..Never gonna go back and will stop recommending this place :(  My previous review:  Ok... M confused !!! I was in Love with this place Coz of amazing tastes, excellent interiors & decor and great customer service. The couple who manages the place (I thought were amazing).  I actually love the lady she has excellent customer service skills, so polite and great.  But today, I had a bad experience. I was so happy to take one of my friend who was visiting me to a great Gelato place. Yeah I understand it's Saturday they have many customers but it doesn't mean the male would be rude .. Very rude. As I stepped in they were few groups before me. They went ahead tried the ice cream and they were being served by the lady .. She was cheerful , polite & nice. Since there were couple of people so they male guy took over the serving. As my turn arrived .. He was rude and said u can only try 2 flavors.. That's ok. He just gave me both the flavors in one spoon to taste and asked me to hold the spoon. And even told my friend u decide n keep what u want. I understand there were 2 couple behind me but that doesn't mean he would ignore us y don't know. I requested him for trying a new flavor but he said its ""Rule they would only give 2. But we saw people before us were given whatever they wanted to try. I am feeling embarrassed my friend felt so bad the way he behaved and talked with us.  I respect their policies & rules but then it should be the same for all customers.  Parking is a pain since only 6-7 spots... Arrogant Response to my review from the Male owner.",0
Coffee Shop 75,This place is absolutely amazing! The people that work here including the owner are so sweet and helpful... They are real Italians which makes the lace so authentic.  The gelato is amazing!!! Just as good as the gelato I had in Italy. The coffee is even better! Definitely a cool spot to come relax and have some coffee and fun donut gelatos!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"2 check-ins Venezia was one of the few places that stayed open late on a weekday evening, and when we walked in we were greeted by very neat decor and the happy faces of our Italian-accented hosts behind the counter. The gelato was very good; I had salted caramel and something else I don't recall. I do recall that my wife and I were quite impressed with it, enough to promise ourselves a return visit. We'll be back.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"My family and I are quite fond of gelato, so once we heard there was a new good spot down south, we had to stop in and try it out.  It wasn't that difficult to find their business, but the parking lot is small.  They allow two sample for free before making your selection.  My son chose a small with two flavors, my husband had a waffle cone, and I chose a medium because I wanted three flavors.  I had the passion fruit, mango, and cappuccino.  I think the passion fruit was my favorite because it had a thin layer of chocolate and was the perfect combination.  We all enjoyed our treats and will definitely return next time we have a craving for gelato.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Very good authentic Italian gelato. Great espresso also. The owners relocated from Italy and are very passionate about their gelato. Nice people. Found my favorite gelato in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Amazing. I loved the cherry gelato. I also had the Italian cream, which was eggy and delicious, and the crème brulee which came with raw sugar on top. Everything was good. The store is very cute and I love that they serve espresso. My girlfriend really liked the stracciatella. I only wish they let you try more than two samples. That cheesecake flavor was calling to me, but I'll have to save that for another day.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I had the MR RING and it was AMAZING!!! Also, they let me sample a couple of gelato flavors who he were equally as incredible! The service is great and very helpful and the pricing is reasonable. I can honestly say this is one of the best gelatos I have ever had and will definitely be going back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Updated review 5 check-ins Still just as good as the first day I visited, but I would reconsider coming if you have a nut allergy. I brought a friend who does have one and found out that she couldn't have anything there. The owners only have one mixer since they're still new and they use it for every thing. I don't believe they have a sign up for that, so hopefully this gets the message out.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Friendly Service and Awesome Iced Coffee. Definitely recommend the cherry gelato too,1
Coffee Shop 75,"I had a small sized gelato, half cherry and half pistachio.  Gelato was nice and smooth. Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,The real deal traditional Italian gelato in Austin. Not sure what to write other than go here for the real deal. Still love Dolce Neve for non-traditional tastes but If you want a true Italian experience in the heart of Texas this is THE place. As an Italian man in Austin I can attest to the Gelato being true to its Italian roots.  Bravo!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Austin needs more spots like this. The gelato is very tasty, and the coffee is great. We're excited to see what Venezia comes up with for their breakfast menu... We went in today and learned that they are serving breakfast from tomorrow.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Not to toot my own horn but I'm sort of an amateur gelato aficionado of sorts. I sometimes pull an all out Ratatouille and spit out freezer burned ""gelato"" out of my mouth in Austin because let's face it, most of the gelato here in our great city is not legit.  Enter Venezia Gelato. This great couple has been in Austin for a year straight from Venice and they serve up the most authentic gelato on this side of the Atlantic. I seriously haven't had better gelato in Seattle, LA, or Vancouver BC. So I am extremely happy we have a great spot here in Austin now.  My favorite surprise was the chocolate which was almost a frozen high quality cake frosting (the only way I know how to describe it which doesn't do it justice) which paired extremely well with my cookies and cream. Not to mention Italian true espresso to complement the ice cream and close out the day. The decor was modern and quaint and this would be the perfect spot to bring a date for lunch or after dinner. Bravo!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I tasted two of their specialty gelato flavors and found both to be very sweet - much sweeter than any I have had during my various trips to Italy. I think there is better gelato to be had in Austin.  The decor was quaint and clean in a modern-Venetian style.  Oddities: 1) Your two samples (limit) are put on the same tiny spoon, so one will affect the flavor of the other. 2) Arriving just after opening, I was surprised to sit at sticky table. 3) There are only six regular parking spaces and nowhere to park on busy Lamar Blvd. (There might be three more available after business hours at the place next door.) 4) Their website cookie policy is in Italian legalese and literally-translated English, which is unintelligible. You must agree to it to access the site, so be aware that you could be agreeing to give up something dear to you.",0
Coffee Shop 75,"First off I have NEVER posted a review before. This place is soooooooooooo amazing that I just had to. They serve authentic gelato, tiramasu and chocolate mousse. They even make donut shaped gelato pops. Mmmmmm. The dining room is so beautiful and clean. The staff was very nice and the hours are perfect. Open til 11 Tues thru Thurs and til midnight Friday and Saturday. Check this place out. You will fall in love!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,Made a special trip to try this place out after seeing such great reviews. I went for the Mr. Ring and it was delightful and decorated beautifully. The mint gelato may seem like a basic choice but I assure you it is a choice you can gladly make.  The owners described their offerings to us with such passion which really added to our great experience. Here's hoping they open a second location that I can get to more quickly!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"""I'd have to get a second job if this were closer to our house,"" said my husband after our first visit here. Every flavor more delicious than the next. Super authentic gelato. I'd say this has claimed the title of best frozen dessert in austin.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Mm they had a hazelnut nutella type gelato in summer. Coffee gelato is good. It's right next door to the tattoo shop. (I missed it driving past last time) They have delicious gelato & the man & woman who own the place are from Italy & so nice & welcoming & always having good conversation with the customers. A perfect gelato business we're lucky to have in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"BEST GELATO EVER!!!! I spent a summer in Sicily and tried a few other places in Austin that I like, but this place is hands down the best dessert you will ever eat! The owners are an adorably sweet couple and the actually remembered me and my friend a month later at our 2nd visit! It's kind of tucked away on Lamar and hard to see so I hope the word gets out. They let you try any flavor, but it's so hard to choose! Seriously you have to stop by",1
Coffee Shop 75,"After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety cannot be matched!!

The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Best gelato in ATX (and believe me, I've tried the all). The only bad thing is that all of the flavors are amazing and it's impossible to decide which one to get. I ultimately got the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. The nutty flavors in the pistachio and hazelnut are incredible. And the cherry is not too sweet and made with luxardo cherrys, giving it a ton of delicious depth. Only other place I've had gelato this good is Italy! Best gelato in ATX! My favorite flavors are the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. But you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"The best homemade gelato I have ever eaten. First time I would say that it wasn't as busy as it should.  Get in there now it's amazing.  The owner is super sweet too, great local business.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I noticed this new bright light beacon in the night as I was driving through my hood down Lamar. And was pumped when I noticed it said Gelato. YES YES YES! So I tired it out last night. When we walked in, I was in love with the decor, the open air of the place, and the super friendly owners and their family that was there. They said they just opened and seemed so excited to show us their products. I've NEVER seen Gelato like this. I think that means all the other ""gelato"" places in Austin, most likely aren't the real deal. My gf and I tried pretty much all the flavors. They were amazing. I don't know how I picked just two! I can't wait to go back and see more new flavors each week. This is great, so close to my house, and so yummy! A WIN FOR '04!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"We just discovered this place and we are very excited. The gelato is so yummy, and the have donut shaped gelato. My kids loved it. They can even put your kids name on them if you order some for a party! Unlike other nearby by ice cream places, there are lots of tables to sit at. The owners are so welcoming and friendly too! This place is definitely one of our weekly outings. It feels like your in Italy! See all photos from Linda T. for Venezia Italian Gelato",1
Coffee Shop 75,The best gelato! Super friendly owners! Great collection of insanely delicious vegan gelatos as well. Passion Fruit Gelato! Must try!!!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"As someone lucky enough to have lived in Italy for more than a year and eaten my way from village to little village being sustained sometimes only on gelato, I consider myself qualified to give review of this new gelateria. And it is truly divine. Does not leave you feeling heavy. Just leaves you feeling high on the taste of natural handmade gelato. I see a lot of gelato in my future!!! The proprietor is the real deal. You can tell he loves his gelato. Gelato heaven at Venezia",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This is real Gelato, you can taste it. It is made with high quality ingredients. The owners are super nice and they know their craft. The pecan gelato is beyond belief and the cheesecake was creamy but not greasy at all, honestly, really good!! Main Entrance",1
Coffee Shop 75,Words cannot describe the love that is put into this gelato. The owners are so incredibly friendly. They want you to try every flavor. It's soooo good!!  Best gelato in ATX. Get the Antonella. It's like Nutella but gelatotized.,1
Coffee Shop 75,Wow wow wow. Amazing gelato and 100% authentic and natural ingredients. Owner is simply awesome. Must thry the Venice chocolate. Best Italian gelato in town and I have tried several great ones!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Hands down, the best gelato I've ever had. In fact, I'm not sure I can even say I've had proper gelato after having had theirs.  There's so much flavor packed into each scoop and their flavors are phenomenal. My personal favorites are the chocolate hazelnut (imagine Nutella but 1000% better) and passion fruit.  The owners are so friendly and kind which only adds to it all.   My Italian friend says this is as close as it gets to what you find in Italy and I'll believe her.  Plenty of parking and places to sit and enjoy this little gem of a place. It's quiet now because they just opened but it's not going to be long before they're packed out.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"The very BEST GELATO in Austin TX! Beautiful location, great service and incredibly good gelato, the same flavor as in Italy, I'm Italian so I know ;) They also have cakes which I will be ordering for my son's birthday!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place is amazing! We were looking for coffee the other day and found it. They saw us waiting outside and opened early for us. The owners are so sweet and the coffee is unlike anything i've ever had before. They gave us a taste of the gelato and I will DEFINITELY be back. It was so creamy, smooth, and delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Authentic, top notch place. From the gelato itself, to the interior design - loved everything about it.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Its the best Gelato in the town. Awesome tastes. So many flavors, and I was confused which one I should take. I took pistachios, spanish cream and passion fruits flavors, and my wife took coffee, yogurt. Also took cappuchino. I dont know how to express the awesome flavors. It rocks! Cappuchino",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Came here one evening as I was in the mood for a late night treat. The owners were super friendly and their gelato did not disappoint!  I tried a couple of different flavors (the Venezia was amazing!) and all were incredibly rich, smooth, and delicious. I ultimately got a cherry, pomegranate, and passion fruit combination which was to die for. The fruit flavors all came together perfectly.  I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area and looking for a tasty treat!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,This place is a must if you want authentic Gelato!! Try the cherry gelato. The gentleman helping us explained that the cherries are shipped from Italy. I have never had cherries that delicious. And they combine it with the gelato! Winning!! I can't wait until our next trip.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place deserves nothing short of 5 stars. I ordered a medium (3 flavors) with passion fruit, hazelnut and Texas pecan. These guys know what they are doing! I couldn't resist the temptation and ordered two more scoops of straciatella and the Venezia. Venezia is the best flavor I have tasted in gelato. It tastes a lot like the inside of a ferrerro rocher. This is now my weekly dessert spot!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Amazing, amazing, amazing. Beyond the delicious and authentic gelato, the owners of this establishment are beautifully educated immigrants from Italy who completely embody the American Spirit. Their dedication to their craft of exquisite Italian desserts is an amazing addition to the Austin community. Clean, sleek and modern environment and a friendly staff. Thank you and we will return next time we are in town!",1
Coffee Shop 75,A two sample limit that comes across as insulting. The gelato is good but seems airy and cheap in a way. Not my favorite and there are better places close by that let you sample until you find something like.  Hahahahahahaha. You have to read this owners response!,0
Coffee Shop 75,"If you do one thing during Texas' neverending summer, treat yourself to this authentic and creamy gelato! You won't be sorry since it has 65% less fat than traditional ice cream so you can come back frequently and taste their 400 flavors! It totally took me back to my favorite gelato shop in Rome, and it even has colorful gelato on a stick for all the kids and kids at heart! Alice and Nicola are true Italians with Texas hospitality so check out their business the next time you are on South Lamar, not too far from Barton Springs or Lady Bird Lake. Divine!",1
Coffee Shop 75,So thankful for a quality gelato shop in the hood.  Love the local feel and the husband and wife owners are so charming and hospitable!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"The hazelnut and pistachio flavours are absolutely delicious!! Will be back soon ;) but the lime was only meh, and I am not a huge fan of the black and white decor- seems a little harsh",1
Coffee Shop 75,Yum!! And the owners are from Italy!!!! Cute shop and super friendly! The gelato pop was amazing! And the hazelnut and pistachio gelato to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 75,The real deal Italian gelato. Home made on premise. Owners are from Venice are super nice. The salted caramel was divine and the cappuccino was like frozen tiramasu. The black cherry was off the hook and the cherries are sourced from Italy. If you're on south Lamar this is a must stop for an afternoon treat or an after dinner dessert.,1
Coffee Shop 75,I fell in love with the gelato!!!! They have so many good flavors and treats. I would recommend this to everyone but keep in mind that if you have a peanut allergy you can't eat here ! The staff was very friendly,1
Coffee Shop 75,"This is the best gelato I have had in Austin, TX for the past 5 years that I have lived and visited this town. My favorite flavors are the Venezia and hazelnut, but you can absolutely taste the quality of fresh ingredients and care that the owners put into all of their gelato. The gelato itself is so rich, creamy, with flavors that really stand out.  I actually met the owner when I went in the shop today and he is genuinely kind which helped make this my new favorite gelato spot here in Austin. Venezia can promise an authentically made gelato because the owners are actually from Italy and have a really cool family history of being in this business so you can be sure they'll do things right.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Authentic Italian gelato-Great variety of flavors and natural ingredients. Awesome place to come and relax with some gelato & a beautiful coffee. Decor is on point ! A little taste of italy. Yum !,1
Coffee Shop 75,"On a hot July night in Austin, this was absolutely the perfect remedy. The authentic feel of the place complimented with the French speaking girl dipping made this a fantastic experience. Got the black biscuit and cannot wait to come back for more!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"The best gelato in America. The passion fruit gelato is incredible. Great customer service, very friendly. A husband and wife team from Italy who make gelato with skills straight from Italy.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Have been here a few times now. Some of the best Gelato I have ever experienced(including Italy). Taste is so fresh! My wife likes the vegan options and has not been disappointed.,1
Coffee Shop 75,I had heard about Venezia back in June so when the opportunity came to check it out I was pleasantly surprised. Great gelato and afterwards we had espresso which hit the spot. LOVE this place.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Great service and prices. Its the REAL DEAL. They are from Italy ad it was nice to have that taste once again. I have missed REAL gelato from Italy since Ive been there before. Nice gem. Clean, great owners and practiced my few words of italian. They have all italian products. Really awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Tried this place for the first time tonight, it was great! The hazelnut gelato is some f the best I've ever had! The cherry is absolutely delicious too. My husband got the cherry and pistachio and said it was great. The husband and wife owners are very sweet, will totally be going back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place is incredibly inconspicuous but absolutely delicious! The flavors are incredible, especially the cheesecake gelato. The owner is incredibly friendly and the environment is relaxing.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Great addition to the South Lamar neighborhood.  REALLY NICE true Italian gelato.....,1
Coffee Shop 75,What a fabulously authentic Gelato spot! Flavors are delicious and the atmosphere a little Italian and a little Austin rolled into one modern space. Definitely a place to come to for a deliciously cool treat on a hot day.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"In short, it's the real deal.  The creamy gelattos are incredibly rich and have great texture.  The fruit gelattos aren't oversweet, and have strong natural flavors.  The dark chocolate was perfect, and the hazelnut was just as strong.  They also have a number of vegan options.  Venezia compares favorably to the best that you might find in Italy, and now sets the bar for Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 75,SUPPORT THIS PLACE. It warrants all caps. The husband and wife team from Italy put their hart and soul into what they make and it shows. They will make you feel welcome.,1
Coffee Shop 75,Delicious. Totally authentic Italian gelato. The pomegranate was so fresh and the Venezia chocolate-amazing.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Great gelato. I'm Italian and visiting this place felt like stepping into an actual Italian gelato place, in the middle of Texas.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Just tried the hazelnut and cheesecake gelato. Husband had the Ferrero and coffee. So delicious and authentic. Our favorite was the hazelnut. Some of the best gelato I've had.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The staff is great here. There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be quiet, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Really cool place! I had a meeting scheduled here by someone, and I am so glad they did. Great vibe and atmosphere! Highly recommend!  This is a gem!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I'm not sure what I did to the workers at this Epoch but they never give me more than 1-word answers and indifferent service. I went in yesterday to order a pour over (overpriced at $5). The cashier took my order and walked over to the area where they make pour overs. I tried to strike up a conversation and got 1-word answers. The barista and other cashier interactions were the same. They were very friendly to some people that appeared to be regulars so maybe it was just me. The Ethiopian pour over was fine but other coffees I've had were nothing special, certainly not enough to make me return anymore. I should've just kept driving down the street to Genuine Joe's, my regular joint that always has good coffee and friendly service.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Wifi is fast!  Mocha's cinnamony and sweet. Not my style but I'm sure it is for some.  Latte is pretty low on that sharp espresso taste, kinda asleep.  Just the one men's toilet and there was a line with maybe 25% of the place filled - if you walk in and this place is full you better be leaving with that coffee!",0
Coffee Shop 20,The fella with he big beard and glasses sold me on the Ethiopian V60 pour over. I'm not a big fan of coffee but this man sold me on the best cup of joe I've ever had. I'll be returning again! Thank you for being so kind and patient. The world needs more people like you! Ethiopian V60 pour over!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I'm not from Austin, but I've been to more than few coffee shops here. When I'm staying in North Austin, Epoch is my new fave. There's plenty of space, a back area with tables, and super fast wifi. Like legit. I went to another spot in east Austin and they were rocking dial up...like for real. I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly. What more do you need when you're writing/studying/on a blind date? It's comfortable and the coffee is great. Check it out next time your in north Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Easily my favorite coffee shop in the entire city.  Had a couple friends come in town, so I couldn't wait to take them there as they are both huge coffee fanatics as well.  Unfortunately, this time the service was less than acceptable.   The guy working the counter was clearly pissed off about working this day, and made sure that everyone ordering knew it.  I gave him my order and afterwards, he just looked at me, then told me the total, without ever acknowledging what I asked for; and same with my girlfriend. My friends were behind us and were ordering next.  They had never been here, and wanted something cold since it was so hot outside.  They tried ordering a ""frappucino"", and they got snapped back that they don't have ""frappucinos"".  They asked if they had something similar, and he said ""yeah, we have the ""blended"" drinks.  When they asked about what flavors were available, he said ""the sign is above you"".  They had never had Horchata before, so they asked what it was, and he responded ""it would take too long to explain what it is, so it is basically a cinnamon flavored coffee drink"".   Very disappointed with the service on this most recent visit, but at least the coffee drinks were great as always; just embarrassing to ""show off"" my favorite coffee place to out of town friends and get this type of visit.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"7 check-ins Love this place! Excellent Americanos. Great layout, cozy and warm decor, always friendly baristas, patio seating out back. A small cozy bar as well. This place is usually pretty quiet when I go in between 12 and 3. Lots of people on their laptops. They do have some food, I think most is premade.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Listed in Coffee Shop Working This is my favorite place to drink coffee and work. It's in a nice complex where you can walk around for a break.,1
Coffee Shop 20,Wow. Had their mocha. It was outstanding. My Starbucks cultured taste buds now have a new definition of good coffee. Things will never be the same after this. One sip and i couldn't resist. Thought about licking the mug. But people were around.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This coffee place is a hidden gem in North Austin.  Think a cross between Mozart's and ""your local"" where people know you and actually talk to you.  They don't just ask your name.  Their latte art was the best I've seen, and yes, I've been to Medici Really pretty coffee art on my mocha",1
Coffee Shop 20,This place is busy busy. I see why now! The coffee is good and cheap!!! It seems too busy and crammed though. Not a type of study place to go too if you're looking for quiet. There are tons of tables and plugs for your laptop/charger though. Baristas were friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"The food and coffee Drinks are great and usually decent customer service, but this time there was a new worker who seemed impatient and not friendly so I will probably not go back again. There's plenty of coffee shops in Austin where staff is very very friendly!",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Coffee is OK but as others have said here, the baristas are hit and miss. When I'm paying you $5 for a latte, I don't need it topped with steamed attitude. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Love Epoch!! hands down my favorite coffee shop in North Austin. Could live off those Iced Mojo's :),1
Coffee Shop 20,Excellent Coffee. Really good atmosphere. I really enjoyed my experience here. It was a really good place to get some work done. It is very cozy!!! They also have super fast wifi too !!!,1
Coffee Shop 20,Good place to work from. Only complaint is the restroom wait time... it can be very long for guys. Guys don't have their own restroom... they share the only one we have with women and women already have two stalls in theirs. Wtf? Can the only men restroom be just for men? Women already have two.,0
Coffee Shop 20,"One of my favorite coffee places. I get a iced soy vanilla latte, the espresso is amazing! My only complaint is they only have one size and it is small for the price compared to other local coffee shops but you do get what you pay for in flavor.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.  The barista was so sweet and patient with me and all of my questions. ""What's good here?"" ""Do u have vanilla almond milk?"" Ect. The drink was made in a jiffy with a beautiful latte leaf design to go. I will definitely be coming back soon.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Updated review I went back to Epoch recently and I think they might have a new manager. They recently closed for a deep cleaning and it's WAY warmer in there now. Also the baristas that were jerks seem to be gone. The coffee is even better.  Seems like they're made a lot of positive changes, which is why I wanted to do this update!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Great place to come off of Anderson Lane. I live in the neighborhood so I come here all the time. Great place to drink coffee and hang out with friends. Small and intimate area but nice courtyard in the back to move around.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em Overall there's nothing wrong with this place. This one-time rating is based mainly on the cranky barista.  SERVICE I don't like to hand out 2-star reviews just based on service but man, this guy was so verbally passive-aggressive I wanted to just hand him a stack of post-it notes so he could write down his thoughts rather than muttering them under his breath in a way we both knew I could still hear him.  AMBIANCE Bumpin 90's R&B like yoooo that Destiny's Child and Tupac!! There is a good amount of seating but a lot of people were there studying as well. Not very hipster -- more of a Panera Bread kind of feel, which is fine.  DRANK A good selection of Asian and Herbal teas. Tax is included! A pot of tea is $4, and I settled on a warm genmaicha to counter the cold and misty weather outside. The pot and cup were a pretty shade of ultramarine blue as well :)  Tl;Dr You'll probably have a better experience than I did, provided that the service doesn't throw sass and shade at you.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Staff: Super friendly and accommodating. Products: Great drinks and they carry Zhi Tea, which is the best tea in town Location: As a Northie, hard to beat. Always plenty of parking. So glad this place exists.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"BIG THANKS to Britt @ Epoch Coffee for introducing San Francisco's most delicious coffee roaster, Ritual Coffee Roasters, to The Great State of Texas!!  This coffee is so delish it doesn't need cream and it sure as heck doesn't need sugar. It's delicious all until itself and Britt made sure Epoch Coffee serves it daily. They also sell it by the package to enjoy at home.  Ritual was started in the heart of the Mission district in San Francisco by Eileen Hassi in 2005. I remember when I worked at Flora Grubb Gardens Eileen teaching me about coffee flavors and roasting while she hand stamped her paper cups with a rubber stamp. Eileen travels to the coffee growers all over the world and makes sure her coffee farmers ""aim for 100% direct trade and hire and take care of the nicest people we can find."" more: ritualroasters.com/about…  Go to Epoch Coffee NOW!",1
Coffee Shop 20,13 check-ins Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee I had 45 minutes to kill before meeting a friend nearby for dinner and decided to check out this new Epoch location.

Coffee Shop 20,"I just edited my review to 0 stars cuz the guy at the front harassed me and RUDELY came over and said ""did you need to order???"" And I said I already had a drink and he was like ""not since I've been here and we're getting busy........."" And that was the most rudest thing I've ever encountered with a business like how many drinks do u want me to get when I go somewhere??? I understand it's a business, but I already ordered something! Horrible employees! This guy had a typical weird austin beard and glasses. This place is a joke. I asked him like am I supposed to order after a certain period of time? Like what is this, buy 1 thing every hour? I've gone to a lot of places to study and this is gross customer service. I think he thinks I'm lying about getting a drink earlier, but that's HIS greedy little problem not mine!  I got a chai tea latte with almond milk and 3 splendas. It didn't come with one of those pouring thingies, I guess that's just for the regular plain teas. The drink wasn't hot like I like it. Right when I brought it to the table I could drink it right away and considering it was so cold outside I really wanted it hottt, but it wasn't at all so that was pretty weird..they need to turn up the heat on their machines. I gave this place 4 stars cuz of the prices! Holy moly, my small cup was $4.25!! Too much. The music is loud. Chai tea latte - almond milk and 3 splendas (made up a healthier version).",0
Coffee Shop 20,"118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art. See all photos from Errol M. for Epoch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I keep giving this place a shot over and over hoping it will get better...but it doesn't. Keep in mind I drink black coffee. I hate anything in my coffee, so if you're looking for mochas or lattes, my review probably won't help you.  My iced and hot americanos were disgusting every time I ordered them. They looked like dirty water, and tasted worse. I tried the iced coffee thinking maybe I'd just stay away from the espresso. It's not much better. For some reason both the americanos and iced coffee have a horribly bitter/I-don't-even-know-how-to-describe-it taste. It's not a flavor in coffee with which I'm familiar. And I've worked in two coffee shops and been drinking coffee since long before I should have started.  I'll admit that while I do appreciate certain coffees more than others, I'm able to appreciate/stand pretty much any coffee, anywhere. I had to throw out my almost-full iced americano, and the others I drank more of basically because I was there with a friend, I paid for them, and I knew that they weren't going to make them any better. But I didn't finish any of them.  I'll also agree on the comments about the attitudes of the employees. I often feel like I'm an inconvenience to them.  The only reason I keep coming here is because I meet a friend about once a week, and she likes this place (for the mojos) and it's a good in-between meet-up. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to request a new meeting place.  If you're in the mood for tea, however, go for it. Even if you're not...go for it.",0

Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Coffee Houses We were visiting our friends in Austin and we stopped in to grab coffeee. The parking lot was super busy too. We walked in and the coffee shop has a ton of room for people to meet up/study. I got the Chai latte and they make their own Chai which isn't as sweet as others. I really liked it and we sat to chat for a while.  If I was still a student in austin, I'd probably come by here to study. My student-self was looking at all the tables and outlets.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Cute location and relaxed feel if you want to get away and have a nice secluded conversation with a friend. Nice couches and plenty of tables for studying and enjoying all the lovely items Epoch has to offer.  Epoch served me my FIRST cappuccino and I'm HOOKED! Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second steeping on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again. I wish there were more laid back/spacious coffee houses in San Antonio! Austinites are SPOILED! My first cappuccino! Oh so good!,1

Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee, great location. Lots places to eat after. Had a  croissant that was fairly hard, so wasn't impressed with pastry selection.

Genuine joes us better for studying on those days, even though its smaller.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Updated review Still love this place! We went in November when it was delightfully nice out and had a couple of vanilla lattes outside and it was really great.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee, tea, and good food.  I'm a big fan of East Side so I of course loved their pizza.  No issues with the staff or Internet.  The parking can be a little weird with the theater next door but that just means a bit further of a walk.  Ultimately the 5 stars come from the fact that there's nothing around it to compete.  Starbucks is ... well, you know.   Genuine Joe experiences have been mixed.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"""Service""? Hahaha. These baristas are the stereotypical holier-than-thou jerks people make jokes about. The coffee is fine, but personally I prefer not to patronize businesses where I'm clearly seen as an annoyance just for ordering.  The other location isn't much better. Starts at the top, I guess.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Not much for decoration or atmosphere... But this cup in front of me might be the best cup of coffee I have ever had.,1

Coffee Shop 20,So much improvement!!! This place has totally turned it around since they opened. That was rocky. Now it's lovely. The staff is great it's clean. Drinks are on point. Great job guys. Oh and the bottled water helps support drug and alcohol recovery so that's awesome!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been a regular to Epoch for about a year now, so this review isn't based on one visit:  Pros: -Coffee is great. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good. -Staff is nice and smiles all around -Wifi is really dependable -Their tables are big! If you like to spread out when you study, come here. -Usually you can find a place to sit at the tables, bar or couch -Love the hipster atmosphere and artwork  Cons: -This place is COLD. I don't mean kind of chilly bring a sweater. I mean after one hour your fingers will be ice and you will be chilled to the bone despite wearing a peacoat. The best tables are lined up on the wall and the air conditioning blasts right on them. Sitting at a table that isn't on the wall helps but definitely doesn't solve the problem. Every time I come here I bring a sweater, but nine times out of ten I have to leave before I planned because I couldn't stand how cold I was. If you're a small or naturally cold person, DO NOT come here or plan to be here for more than 30 minutes. Earlier this morning it was 50 degrees outside and they still had the air conditioning on -- I left earlier than I wanted to.  I really want to like coming here, especially because it's so close to my place, but I just hate how cold it is.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"If you ever are looking to grab a cup of coffee you should give this place a try at least once. I have not had many things here as I feel the only thing I need is the Iced Mojo, but based purely on the Iced Mojo itself I highly recommend it. No need for creamer or sugar it is good to go!  The staff/employees do provide the service expected but do not go above and beyond.  Cozy environment, not as hipster as some of the Epochs closer to downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee- the baristas were great. I use to be a barista so when I get a taste of a good cup of black I really appreciate it. The energy seemed a bit lacking in the atmosphere this morning. But that could just be me, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",1

Coffee Shop 20,"Pretty nice place here, very good environment for studying if you can in a coffee house environment. I got some coconut chai tea without milk and it cost around $4. The only complaint I would have was that after I finished the tea, there were these little bugs flying around and into my cup and it was a bit disgusting. Other than the fly problem, it was pretty good place and tea. The flies are an easy problem to get rid of. Coconut Chai Latte",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Just have to say that I stopped by Epoch because Genuine Joe doesn't understand the concept of staying open during their posted times and how that affects customer service.    So my g/f and I walk in and the place is packed, but the line is small.  Apparently this was the place to be on a Saturday night.  We walk up to the counter and the barista was super nice.  Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"4 check-ins That area needed a good coffeehouse and this was it. I was sick and tired of going to a coffeehouse which I'm going to name but I'll give you a hint - they have private events scheduled and they will kick you out of the room. Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot. If I'm in the area, this is where I'm going to get some good coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I like this place, even though I've recently sworn off caffeine (mostly). The service is nice and the selection of teas and snacks is good. I got a burnt (like, ""why did you think it was okay to put these ingredients into the tortilla?,"" burnt) breakfast taco, emailed them (nicely!) about it, and they gave me a gift card to apologize.  I do wish they could better control noise, and have more outlets for laptops, but if you go prepared with headphones and a full battery you'll enjoy your experience.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Love this place. I usually get the mocha with almond milk. Always good. They serve Tyson's breakfast tacos in the morning. Baristas are always friendly. Plenty of tables and wifi. Great spot to chill or get out of the office.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"I have been to this place a couple of times -- usually Saturday afternoons.  I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.  Overall, pretty good -- but definitely not the end all.",1

I like the original location ok, but this one suits my style a bit more. (Yeah, I know, I'm a bit of yuppie.) They also display local artists work.  There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back. The baristas are always friendly and willing to debate you on which Star Wars movie is best, plus they make a mean cortado.  NOTE: They FINALLY fixed that second door in the ladies room a couple months ago.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This place had a cute atmosphere, plenty of comfortable seating, extremely amiable staff, and just a generally pleasant place to work. Unfortunately I have to dock it for it's coffee though. I haven't tried everything, but the few drinks I've had were ok at best. I haven't tried the food or the tea so I'm not reviewing those, but I do wish the coffee were better. That being said, I like sweet drinks so if you don't, then you'll probably like it more than I did.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Edit: I left 30 minutes in because the music was so horrible and loud. It was old-timey country at first, but abruptly turned 80s alternative. The first song in that sequence was Buffalo Bob's transvestite song in ""Silence of the Lambs."" This is more of a place for people in their 30s or 40s.  First off, this is in a really cool little area. It's right next to Alamo Drafthouse on Anderson (which also means that parking is hopeless). It's part of a community of businesses centered around this leafy garden thing.  It's small, but not comfy. Lighting is poor, but people seem to be studying here with some success. The first two chairs I tried sitting in were wobbly/off-balanced. It's as hot as it is outside, but thankfully a little less humid. Unfortunately, I forgot my headphones, so I'm forced to listen to old-timey country. I probably won't be coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Good place. Got italian soda and fruit and hubby got the iced cappuicunio. Caramel sounds good.

Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp Challenge, Coffee addicts, step up! What the F is a cortado? I didn't know, so I ordered it. And surprisingly, I liked it. I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.  However, I like coffee, the W. Anderson Lane area, and Topo Chico :-)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost In comparison to the original Epoch, I'm a huge fan. There's parking, open tables, and light! And the bathroom doesn't scare you. High fives all around.  I'm still a fan of the other Epoch, but this one suites me a bit more. They offer Cuvee coffee and will brew it up via Chemex or Clever. The drip coffee is cheap, and refills are only $1. The mocha here is still good, but you can only go Mexican mocha. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups. There's some nice couch space  and bar seating here also. The wi-fi can be spotty though, so that's one knack on it.  Solid shop.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"My favorite coffee shop. Pros: lots of room, comfy seating, 2 very strong wifi networks, a patio, often good music is playing, like Jeff Buckley, instead of that horrible coffee house music you get in places Cons: pastry selection isn't very broad, dine-in cups are so wide that the coffee goes cold quickly",1
Coffee Shop 20,"So- I love coffee shops.  I especially love coffee shops with sofas ( really the only way to work). I love a barista that can make a really good latte. I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Circa13 is everything a coffee shop should be.  Plenty of places to sit and talk/work. Numerous power outlets, free WiFi and open until Midnight.  They brew up several local teas, Cuvee coffee and serve baked goods from Russell's Bakery. Also serve salad/sandwiches from 10AM-2PM for lunch but I haven't had the chance to try them yet.  Woohoo!

Coffee Shop 20,"21 check-ins ROTD This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

Coffee Shop 20,"Updated review My opinion of this coffee shop has declined somewhat since my original review.  A few notable bad experiences:  - Standing and waiting for the barista to serve me, even though there was no one else in line.  I had to finally say ""excuse me, can I get some service?"" to get said barista to do his job. -  Ordering a coffee, only to find -- they're out of coffee.  This has actually happened a few times.  I had to wait for them to brew a fresh batch. -  Some days, the coffee tastes like watered-down swill.  Other days, it's delicious.  This place happens to be right around the corner from where I work, so I keep giving it chances.  Wish the staff would get it together.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Four stars means that I liked it AND I'm coming back here preferentially when in the area :)  Because there are no coffeeshops in North Austin as awesome as Epoch and as accessible!  The coffee, tea, and food selection is good, but that's not why you come to Epoch!  You come here because you need some downtime, maybe on a couch, with some wifi and isolation.  Or you come here because you need a quiet place to chat with a friend or three.  Or you can come here to play games with folks.  It all works at Epoch.    I no longer have to drive 30 min to get to North Loop and Guadalupe--halleloo.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"10 check-ins Listed in Coffee Thursday This place is very different from the North Loop location, but not in a bad way. It's just different. There's lots of seating with 2 top tables, bar seating, and a section with couches and armchairs for relaxin'. When I got there, nobody was at the counter for me to order but he popped out from the back after a bit and apologized. Genuine smile, so, of course, he was forgiven.  I always get the Mexican mocha or an iced Mojo from Epoch so I got the Mexican mocha to see how this one compared to the original location. Crazy tasty!  This location has a more modern feel to it than the other location, which is nice...I like having diversity without having to sacrifice deliciousness! They'll get another star out of me when they increase they're bakery/food options! Can a girl get a danish or a piece of cake??",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Their iced mojo is amazing. The shop is spacious and the servers are wonderfully personable. I love this coffee shop.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"If their wifi was as dependably good as the coffee, it would be hard to ever pry me out. Love the back patio as long the smokers arent around!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Their espresso is vibrant and juicy, they insist relentlessly on quality ingredients, and I have never had a negative experience with any of the staff. I really like the wide space available and it is a calm, sedate place - not crammed with noisy meetings or unsupervised children. They have organic almond milk available! I really love coming here before work to focus my thoughts or work quietly on a project. It's amazing to be here in the early hours especially, and I love having this charming little space in the neighborhood.",1

Coffee Shop 20,"- Great place to study - Great Coffee - The customer service does not meet my expectations though.  This place is a great place to study or work on anything. There are a lot of tables that are available before the evening and is pack usually at night. When I came there, it was empty and there were several places to study. During this time, I didn't purchase anything yet. When it started to get more busier, one of the cashier or possibly owner walked towards my friend and I to tell us  ""This place is getting crowded, either get something or get out!"" I thought this was incredibly rude, but I do understand a business is a business. I would  appreciate it if he asked us if we wanted anything to drink. One good thing was that when I bought my drink, he apologized and that is something I appreciated.",0

Coffee Shop 20,"If you want to head here because you enjoy the original Epoch, don't bother.

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey.

This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave.

Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again. Double espresso with tonic water. Beautiful Macha A beary lovely mocha!",1
Coffee Shop 66,Really love the atmosphere here! I frequent coffee shops and this one is definitely unique and worth checking out.  Pros: great atmosphere Friendly staff Good hangout/ study environment Beautiful lighting Tasty drinks  Cons: no wifi Slightly pricey Pretty things Love all the details here. It just has good vibes. Definitely the perfect cafe atmosphere. See all photos from Sierra L. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Check out this video for a review! youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ki…  Cool new place in Austin! It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun. One thing is that there's no internet, so don't plan on coming here to get stuff done!  You get to order on an ipad! yay.  Pros: - the drink choices are really great. You can get something that you want. You can even get beer here. - great for pictures and enjoying some time off. Sit on a swing ... while playing chase. - parking is plentiful in the plaza area. - friendly baristas  Cons: - food menu isn't too big, but that's okay. Not gluten free for the wife. - very pricey. If you need a place to come on a weekly basis, you're going to need to be a balla.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3.",1
Coffee Shop 66,So much aesthetic in this place. I love every corner of this coffee shop. The only downside is there's no wifi. Their matcha latte is to die for! See all photos from Rojean S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought, just a cafe with a couple of food options. The Nutella waffles we got were on point - there's also a chicken option.  The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options. I hope they add more items to the menu! Milk tea - humongous!! Nutella banana waffles Love the illustrations! See all photos from Ramya B. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,"The greeting of an atmosphere it feels I created. This place speaks to my free spirited soul, with matcha lattes, swings inside that still fit in, pillows, and waffles. This might be the next artist home where computers aren't encouraged by the architecture, but books, talking and chess are. Matcha latte with lactose free milk and house book",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Craft coffee drinks, tea, and beer/wine. Friendly staff, good music and nice atmosphere complete with with a few rope swings from he ceiling. And let's not forget the amazing waffles!! Nice place to chill with friends.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated prices and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Guys, this place is amazing. Limited food menu but both waffle offerings will blow you away! Crazy good spices on the chicken. The coffee and matcha were both stellar as well. Service was friendly and efficient. The space is stunning and cozy. Highly recommend. Will be my new go-to relaxation spot in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks. Highly recommended, so get here when you can!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is amazing! No wifi, but that's fine. it's meant to be a place to hang out with friends, socialize or by yourself reading a good book!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I never write Yelp reviews, ever. But when I walked in here it felt like I was in a hipster Alice in wonderland. The decor is spot on and they left no details out. The Marymint Monroe is really amazing and the chicken and waffle is really good. The staff is so wonderful too, you could tell they really love what they're doing. The swings are a nice touch too!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit. You will want to try their swing for sure. Seating space is somewhat limited and no wifi is available, so be aware. This is more like a place for you to enjoy its atmosphere. Drinks were good, though make sure you have enough in your bank account because their drinks are probably not for broke college students. That swing!",1
Coffee Shop 66,I really enjoyed my visit here. I ordered the cortado and chicken waffle. Both were excellent.  The space is very Instagram worthy.  Awesome mural. Staff was very friendly too and I loved the iPad ordering system. Chicken waffle and cortado paired with sparkling water to cleanse the palate,1
Coffee Shop 66,"7 check-ins The Factory Cafe is overall such a beautiful and really cool place to just hang out with friends or work on homework. You'll probably see the people around you taking the time to perfect their aesthetic Instagram pictures and Snapchat stories (myself included). Although the cafe itself doesn't provide wifi, it's within range of other places with wifi so that shouldn't deter you from going! This place looks like it literally came straight off of Pinterest! So cute!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"My only complaint and desire and heart wish is for this place to be open longer and to allow for Wifi. This place makes my heart happy, it motivates me to study because I want to come here, and it makes me wish I had time to settle and read a wonderful book. The atmosphere is PERFECT, the workers are GENEROUS AND KIND, it's a beautiful place to be.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces.

Coffee Shop 66,"Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!  This place has homemade pop tarts!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is really nice. They have done a great job... It's the type of place that you could spend hours in. They have a small menu right now, but their drinks, waffles, and pastries are really well made. We'll definitely be coming back soon.... like tomorrow. Viva Matcha Latte and Pop-art",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I got waffle wasted at The Factory!!! Not your average coffee shop! Super social without wifi, novel idea!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Honestly, this place is having an identity crisis. Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute decor (props to the designer), but music is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed art of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay open till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a beer/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the owners will rethink their direction. Would I come back? Eeh, too many other treats to entice my attention.",0

Coffee Shop 66,This place is fantastic! Ideal place for grabbing a frothy matcha latte and a chicken & waffle. A bit different in the way that you order. Definitely a nice hang-out for millenials or anyone who works in the area and is on a lunch break. Wifi is within reach but they don't have it themselves.,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Enthusiastic and earnest desire to be excellent, try new things and develop new menu ideas, smiles, not in your face - best almond pound cake I've ever had (worth the 5 stars alone), and a fantastic cup of red rooibos iced tea.  next to Hanabi.  fantastic new spot.",1

Coffee Shop 66,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love this place. I really appreciate the lack of wifi. Makes it much easier to have good conversations or lose yourself in a good book. Agree that it's a bit pricey, but the drinks are really good.",1

I had the chicken and waffles (new take, but I now have cravings for them!), the homemade Poptart was so fun and such a delight. In terms of beverages got the drink with the chicory in it (I'm a big chicory fan) and it was perfect!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This spot is super cute (""like eating in a Pottery Barn""), with drinks that are unique and with a somewhat limited menu. We tried the chicken and waffles, which was surprisingly delicious and our drinks were also tasty. I had the Livin La Vida Mocha and my husband had the pour over. I will definitely return with company, but prices weren't good enough to make this a regular stop in our rotation.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love the Factory. Good coffee, tasty chicken and waffles and awesome atmosphere. Definitely recommend the Nutella waffle.",1
Coffee Shop 66,AMAZING atmosphere! I walked around for 5 minutes looking at everything before even ordering.  Most unique take on chicken and waffles I've ever had. Hands down best night time hangout in North Austin. P.S.... their Matcha Latte is to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"I am very impressed with this place. The food portions were so perfect and not mention delicious! The waffle architects (staff) were all so accommodating and nice. We were able to talk to one of the owners for a bit and he was very helpful with his recommendations and accurate. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back when I am in Austin again. Nutella and Banana waffles. Chicken and Waffles, Olive Oil Pound Cake, and Milk Tea! Yummy.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful art.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very expensive for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.",0

The VANILLA CAPPUCCINO & the CHOCOLATE MUFFIN I had were INCREDIBLE! I felt so bad drinking my cappuccino cuz he drew a PREETY FLOWER on it & there I go drinking & ruining it!! But it was WORTH IT! The DECOR is FABULOUS! And they actually have a LOT OF PARKING SPOTS!! And they had  COFFEE TASTING that I participated in...it was my 1st experience! Iv had wine tasting but never coffee tasting & it was so much FUN!! I LOVE IT! SO PREETY I felt bad drinking it lol,1
Coffee Shop 32,Listed in New City (A-TX) Nice place. Good Crowd. Coffee & Snacks like Chocolate Muffins also.  I found what I was looking for. A place to work outside my house.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Updated review The baristas here are top notch and the interior is clean and pleasant.  I ordered a cappuccino and a scone. The coffee had a lot of warm flavors and the preparation was excellent.  Staff is laid back and friendly, music is nice and the seating is comfy.

Coffee Shop 32,"Looks nice from the outside but its alright. There's nothing special about their coffee. Just taste like all other coffee.  I tried their Japanese Coffee and the worker there told me it was suppose to taste a little sweet and a little bit of blueberry?! Well once i got my drink and tasted it.... I thought I just ordered cold brew... There wasn't anything popping and extravagant about the coffee. I think their drinks are also a little too overpriced. I ordered two drinks. One for my sis and one for myself. Total came out to be $10!! FOR TWO DRINKS?! I don't know about that...  I went with a group of friends and all of their opinions were ""ehh its not bad..but not great"" I'm glad I came to try it out but definitely would not come back. japanese coffee. taste like cold brew",0

Coffee Shop 32,Cute place with enough small tables to work independently but not many to meet a group. I like the outside seating and the hibiscus blueberry iced tea! I was able to find parking without much problem but cannot speak to the coffee as I didn't try any. Yummy scone with a cute hot chocolate Hibiscus blueberry iced tea,1
Coffee Shop 32,"My husband and I paid a visit to Houndstooth after reading several positive reviews online, reporting this coffee shop as one of the best in Austin.  After trying it for ourselves, I have to admit they do serve excellent coffee; my tasty iced latte was very well made. My husband's chai latte was delicious and among the best we've had in the city.  That being said, I found myself a bit shocked when I looked at the bill; the coffee cup size was smaller than what I usually get at other third wave coffee shops, yet the cost was at least a dollar more expensive. Yes, the coffee is good, but is it THAT good? My wallet isn't so sure!  Another point that left me disappointed was the pastries; not only was the selection very limited, but upon asking if the barista could reheat my croissant, he reply they couldn't as they do not have a microwave and that they probably never will have one as they fear customers would ask them to use it to reheat their coffee. Hum, what?  No, I don't want you to put my croissant (or cold coffee for that matter) in the microwave. That's disgusting. I would think however it would be a really smart idea to invest in a mini oven used to bake fresh parties or simply reheat them for 30 seconds. My croissant was cold and a bit lifeless. This problem could so easily be fixed! The way I see it, if you're going to do pastries, do it right or not at all, especially with the high prices you are asking your customers to pay!  Will I be back? I don't know. I'm kind of thrown off by the attitude and prices. That being said, Houndstooth does have great coffee and deserves its fame in that department.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth has the best coffee quality in Austin. A little pricy for the size, but the coffee is always great and tasty.  Baristas are all very knowledgeable and kind. They know how to use their fancy coffee brewer and make pretty coffee art. Also, the guys are always well-dressed with nice button down shirts, bow ties and hats. Heh  The shop itself is pretty small, very limited seating with nice decors. When you come during rush time, you'll usually not able to find spots. But the coffee is great to go as well.  Music is a bit too loud and repetitive  music was annoying at times. Hard to concentrate with that. See all photos from Tiffany C. for Houndstooth Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 32,"My second visit and once again the condescension is so thick you can cut it with a knife. The baristas smile as they reenact the High Fidelity record store scene in their heads: they can tell I am not sufficiently a coffee snob to deserve to shop in their store.  Plus, they couldn't even accommodate the one bit of coffee snobbery I *do* have: they can only do a large drink in a paper cup.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins Listed in Did someone say coffee? I usually hate picking favorites, favorite restaurant, favorite movie, favorite drink, etc. It's such a stressful decision with so many factors. But, Houndstooth is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin. It's the only place I get cappucino and know to expect only goodness. They're always consistent, and the baristas friendly.  The only con of this place is that outlets are pretty sparse and the seatings tend to be full most of the time I've gone. It's not a cafe I would study at, but definitely to drop by for a cup to-go or a chatty time with a friend or two.  Oh how I'm going to miss Houndstooth!",1
Coffee Shop 32,My friend and I truly enjoyed our afternoon tea and scone.  It was crowded during our visit and we opted to sit outdoors since the indoor seating was full. The decor mix of modern and rustic had an open feel for the small interior space.  The vibe of this cafe will make you want to stay a while and leisurely enjoy your coffee or tea. They serve hot tea in a side teapot with a mug that is graced with an graphic of the State of Texas at the bottom. We both enjoyed our teas and thought our blueberry scone that we split was great.

Coffee Shop 32,This place is very dickhead. There's a rumor going around that the best baristas are dickheads though. I'm convinced. So the place is little and every seat inside and out has a butt in it so everyone loves it. I had chai tea and it was fantastic and probably the most delicious chai I've ever had!!! So good.  They have chocolate and plenty of parking. Came for coffee left with chai. Homeboy got the mocha. Said it was fantabulous,1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List How have I never been here before!?! Mad props to Scotty G for the introduction!  I was in caffeinated, coffee heaven! There were so many amazing choices and I can only imagine each one is done well!  I had Japanese cold brew, which half the fun is watching it be made. My friend had the the carbonated tea, which tasted just like it smelled, dreamy! He also go their signature lil coffee cocktail the ""Jo and Jam"" that was so darn adorable, I didn't want him to drink it!  Watching the baristas flutter about behind the bar was like watching dancing butterflies and each and every one of them were so nice, approachable and *gasp* talkative!  It was pretty crowded on Sunday afternoon, so we stood at the bar and enjoyed the show. The crowd here was an eclectic mix of everybody and seemed to be a hodgepodge of regulars and newbs. I am not going to lie...pretty much everyone in the place was easy on the eyes.  I will definitely be back to peruse more of their espresso offerings, enjoy the eye candy, and hopefully take advantage of one of their Monday coffee tastings!

Coffee Shop 32,"First, I'm going to say the 5 stars are for the quality, flavor, atmosphere and overall experience. To read the one hang-up please scroll to the end. We both got mochas. The wait time was good, the baristas are visible and engaging, and you can really tell this is their craft. They love making coffee, and it shows. The aroma when you walk in is delicious and our drinks raised our eyebrows. Even though it was busy we had no problem finding a seat. We were in there about 90 minutes and the line was never shorter than 5 people. I do think they should have a visible menu though.  My one dismay was the cost. We got a 12oz mocha and a 16oz mocha and it was TWELVE DOLLARS. Twelve dollars!!!!!!! By far the most expensive coffee we've ever had, but they had hundreds of customers lined up so it doesn't seem to deter people. The quality was top notch, but I still don't see how you justify that price. Mocha See all photos from Ashley K. for Houndstooth Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Real simple, wow!!!! Every time we come to Austin we swing by. So worth it, line moves fast and service always has the Austin touch to it.... Like crack.....so perfect",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Hmmm... It could be more.  For a long time I've heard Houndstooth has great coffee, so this morning as I needed a cup while perusing the paper I thought, why not? Well, here's why not.  In fairness, I've only had one experience here, but it didn't make me want to come back. Maybe you will fare better.  The good: its a relatively low-key place - I don't remember any weird music wafting over the speakers as some places do. I was greeted as soon as I came in, there is ample seating including a comfy love seat and some cushioned chairs as well as the range of high tops tables and bar stools and, as a plus, a long community table seating maybe a dozen friends, family or maybe strangers-about-to-be friends. Every coffee shop should have one of these! And don't forget cleanliness - you and I have been to coffee shops where you're afraid to touch anything much less drink or eat, but Houndstooth isn't like that, at least not the one on North Lamar across from Central Market. It is clean and orderly with a nice mid-century modern chic.  Wow Chris, sounds like you like this place. Why only two stars? Okay, here's the downside.  I asked for a cup of bold rich coffee - there were several choices and I like to listen to the barista's advice. Although I could see several of the beans listed in front of me my barista said, oh, that would be our house blend. House blend? Okay, I'll give it a shot... The house blend was served almost hot (not hot enough Houndstooth) and was not memorable. Better than average? Sure. Anywhere near Thunderbird's? No, not in the same galaxy. Fuggetaboutit.  The croissant I order was small - close to junior - and was hard. As in not fresh. While I don't eat croissants often when I do I want a real one, sizable and fresh. Houndstooth was neither. I sometimes will pop an old croissant into the microwave to take the edge of the staleness but you really shouldn't have to. This one was just forgettable. My drink - a normal-sized mug - appeared on the bar but I never heard the barista call it out even though the comfy love seat I camped on was six feet away. Weird. Through-out my visit I noticed the barista called out all the drinks without volume or enthusiasm, so, if you happened to be somewhere else I'm not sure how you would hear him.  The cup and croissant, neither of which was large, set me bak $6. A little steep for mediocrity my friends.  Was not clear where to put my used dish and mug when I was down so I laid it on the corner of the bar with the consent of the barista, but even he didn't seem to know where to put it. I never saw anyone come out from behind the bar bussing the floor so its not clear to me how things get back to the kitchen.  All in all, not bad - definitely not one-star - but just no real reason ever to go back.",0
Coffee Shop 32,Amazing coffee with an environment to match. A great place for writers and people that work remotely on laptops. The service is always great!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"9 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Houndstooth is one of my favorite places to study; the environment is great and the place is clean and comfortable. I've only been to the Lamar location, but I really like it!  As for the beverages,  they definitely take their craft seriously at Houndstooth and have several 'daily brews' to choose from. I think Houndstooth has some of the most talented baristas in Austin. Not a place to go if you're looking for something similar to Starbucks' sugary, fake coffee beverage; this is the real deal.  I haven't quite decided if the great bitter taste that I love about Houndstooth is worth the hefty price associated with their drinks. I do really love their coffee, and would prefer it over a lot of other places in Austin, but the price deters me from visiting often.  Also, if you don't prefer the rich coffee taste, I wouldn't come here. I took my sister here who is less favorable with the bitter taste and she had to add quite a bit of sugar to her drink in order to tolerate it.  Upsides: Quality coffee, nice bathrooms, friendly workers  Downsides: Limited menu, hard to find seating during busy hours, super pricey",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Reviews were promising, stopped in for their Colombian blend pour over. It was smooth, but did not lose a robust flavor.  What it could have lost were the grounds in the cup and about a $1.50 off the price.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"I just had the best experience here. I wish I had the name of the girl who helped me. I told her I had coffee-loving family members coming in town and needed help with buying the right coffee. She took her time to explain everything in great detail and even asked a co-worker for a second opinion. I was coming straight from a surgery, so her energy and attitude really lifted my spirits. Obviously, I know little about coffee but this experience will most definitely bring me back. Thank you to this sweet employee. Your kindness did not go unnoticed.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"My go-to drink is an iced caramel latte. When a place doesn't have caramel, I opt for vanilla and cinnamon. But houndstooth had vanilla and honey so that's what I ordered. Because I love honey and I'm trying to stop myself from adding syrup or sugar to my coffee after receiving it.  Sweet enough to satisfy me while still letting the coffee flavor (the bitterness) to seep through.  Not enough outlets so that's why I'm docking a star. If I could, I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars because of lack of seating as well. Coffee is a solid 4-5 stars. For some reason, all the outlets are in the back corner of the place, which doesn't make sense considering there's a huge AF table for community seating at the front, but with no outlets around it.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Good, not great coffee ( I think it's a bit over hyped) but friendly staff and nice environment. It's right next to Taco Deli which makes for a great weekend pairing.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Updated review I'd like to preface this by saying I do not leave negative reviews without talking to the place I'm reviewing first.  I messaged the business through their payment system and received a response, but it doesn't appear that the issue has actually been addressed. This used to be our favorite coffee place in town.  But the quality of the coffee has declined sharply in the past few months.  After yet another undrinkable latte this morning, I feel like I have to change my previous 5 star review.  The coffees have been coming out with inconsistent espresso shots, and burning hot milk with no texture.   It's a bummer, because we've been coming here forever and the staff are all lovely, but I can't recommend the coffee here anymore.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"The coffee here is the strongest coffee I've had in Austin!!!!! Well.. my tolerance for coffee isn't that insane, so I only need a cup of their hot brewed black coffee and I'm good for the day.  My friend and I always come here after we finish our meal at Tacodeli (next door, check it out!!!!). It's always packed and not exactly a super large shop, so I wouldn't come here to study. It has kind of a hipster vibe cuz on the wall it says ""the pattern of coffee and people"", there's a big shiny fancy machine, and the (very nice) baristas always dress hipster and have big glasses/mustaches.  One time, I had some ""hot"" chocolate-flavored donut recommended by the cashier but it was really weird... I expected cinnamon or something but it was just some actual spicy donut with a bad aftertaste.... Idk yo but after that experience, I would just stick to ordering their coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great coffee and environment equally conducive to work, chit-chat or a break at the same time. Yes parking is a problem, just like it is in pretty much any place in downtown. The baristas know their craft, and they don't mind telling you about it either. Did I say the coffee is great? you can't go wrong with a latte or a flat white, but do try the specials they might have - those might surprise you as well.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Based on a rainy Saturday afternoon:  Pros: -interesting layout; really puts the coffee front and center -baristas were VERY friendly and helpful -mocha didn't blow me away, but it was satisfying and had lovely latte art  Cons: -it was super packed 2-5pm with an almost overwhelming amount of noise. By 6:30 it was much calmer and more enjoyable, so it really matters when you go -there are only outlets on one wall of the coffee shop  If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars. I see why people like it, but I think there's a lot of variance in the actual experience you might have there. Would definitely be up for another visit to get a better feel for it Mocha",1
Coffee Shop 32,"$5.00 for a latte with skim milk (which I thought was nonfat but turned out to be 1%), $4.41 for a chai latte. They only have one size which was something like 6-8 ounces. Pretty weak taste. Slightly fruity aftertaste which was good but nothing special. The milk was steamed ok. Maybe an extra shot would have made it better but it's already an expensive drink for what it is and not worth it.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee Houndstooth is serving up fantastically wonderful coffee, and it is no wonder why they were packed when a friend and I dropped in mid-day on Thursday. The many different types of low chairs, high chairs, outdoor patio seating, and a bar to stand at were pretty much fully packed. There was also a fairly consistent line and the baristas were flowing through orders smoothly. There were a lot of people working, and a lot of people meeting up to sit and enjoy the space.  We both ordered lattes and were seriously blown away by the smoothness of the coffee. It had no bitter qualities, wasn't overly dry, (think like a dry wine on the tongue) and there was a perfect balance between the milk, coffee, and ice in the lattes. I think I paid around $4.50 for my coffee - and for the quality, it is an incredibly fair price. I really can't say enough good things about this place - I just wish it was closer to home for me, I'd probably stop in weekly!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Friend and I needed a place to get some work done during an afternoon in Austin, and we came to Houndstooth Coffee. We had an amazing time here - and I still remember the experience distinctly (it's been months since I've been).  Amazing coffee, beautiful open space, strong wifi. It feels trendy and cool and hip all at the same time, while delivering on an amazing guest experience. Barista was super nice and answered a bunch of my questions about the menu, and we felt totally comfortable staking out for over 3 hours just cranking out some work with our drinks.  Loved my time here. Would definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 32,The quality is top-notch at Houndstooth and the fact that they offer TacoDeli is a huge plus in my book. Overall a great location with ample seating both inside and out. There are plenty of coffee options in downtown but Houndstooth should be near the top of your list.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Randomly stumbled upon this place on the way to Moonshine for a rehearsal dinner (I was visiting from out of town), and I'm really glad we did. I ordered a Cortado, and it was one of the best coffee drinks I've had in my entire life. The barista was funny (with just the right level of haughtiness you would expect from someone capable of making such a top-notch drink), and the cafe was clean and spacious. I recommend this to anyone living in or visiting Austin, and I will make a point to go back next time I'm in town.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great coffee and most of all, great service. They made the wrong drink for my friend and even though she accepted it, they refused to serve the wrong drink so they immediately whipped up another one (correctly this time)! The service is always very pleasant. My only wish would be for more outlets for studying as it does get crowded fast (loud as well, but earphones can silence the noise). Great ambiance and environment.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"ooohhh myyyy goddddd. If you have no life, like to blow your money and have eternity to spend in line, this is the place for you.  I was in the area, and saw Houndstooth-- looked it up on yelp and with high ratings I figured I would give it a try! The place was filled with your typical hipsters that look poor but probably spent $200 bucks on their haircuts and another few hundreds on a t-shirt that already looked used. There were about 5 people in line (it was 10:00am when I walked in), not too bad for a Thursday morning and figured it would move quickly. Pull some shots, pour some milk, next person... right? (I've been a barista at a nice coffee shop, I know how to hustle behind the counter). Well, WRONG. These employees have NO REGARDS for their customers time. I couldn't figure out what was taking so long, I spent 20 minutes before I got to the front of the line. There were only FIVE people ahead of me.... how does it take 20 minutes?? I'm so annoyed.  Now here's the kicker. I ordered an Iced Latte. No size options were asked, so figured they had a standard 12- 14oz cup. I paid $5.50 for the coffee (ridiculous) and added a buck for tip. When I got my coffee, it was teeny. Maybe a 10 oz cup? Which half was filled with ice. So for $6.50 I got about 4 oz of liquid. MEDIOCRE liquid.  Moral of the story- GO TO STARBUCKS. For half the time and money, you'll get an equal cup of mediocre coffee. I paid $6.50 for the smallest iced latte. Rip off.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"Coffee tasted good and was $2.70 for a regular drip coffee. Parking is limited, but that's not the store's fault. Staff was friendly and helpful. They have coffee tastings twice a week, which I participated in during my visit. Glad I checked here out.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great coffee & ever better service! I've been to a couple places where the barista doesn't even acknowledge you... That is not this place. Extremely friendly, they make sure that you're getting what you want & let you know all the different options available.  I had the Americano & it was on the money! Sweet coffee shop Americano",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I got to swing by Houndstooth and my experience was pleasant.  The barista was really nice. He introduced us to popular drinks and gave us a rundown on what special was going on in the summer.  I decided to play it safe with an iced chai, but my friend got the carbonated tea.  I loved the 'feel' of the restaurant. The interior was clean and modern. Definitely coming back for some coffee next time!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Best espresso in Austin hands down. Smooth, smooth shots and never burnt. Totally dickhead. Will visit again!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Full disclosure: I'm kind of a cheap person. I'm also a coffee lover. As a result, I'm one of those people who thinks that if I'm paying upwards of $8 for an expresso drink, it had better be delicious. Enter Houndstooth, my very favorite coffe shop.  Even though I live in San Antonio, I try to hit this place up every time I'm in Austin. I have been to both locations several times, and whenever I pull into the parking lot, my wallet starts to tremble. Because just about every time I've been here, I've ended up spending ~$40 for a couple of drinks and a bag of beans to take home. Recall, I'm a confessed penny pincher. Never once have I regretted shelling over my precious monies to Houndstooth. It has been worth it every single time.  If you're someone who has a go-to drink you normally order at coffee shops, give it a try here. Chances are you've never had it made as well as these people are going to make it. But if you're the adventurous type--and I would highly enoucourage you to be in this case--check out their seasonal specials. From the chilled coffee julep in the summer to the precious 'Ginger in the Snow' they featured this past Christmas, I have thoroughly enjoyed their seasonal offerings throughout the year.  I should probably note that I've rarely been here during the morning rush. Most of my visits have been later in the day, and there's usually at least a person or two ahead of me. It's like the locals have started catching on to how good this place is. Alas, I guess I'll have to share...  I will say that while the line might not move as quickly as it does at the national chain places, I've",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great coffee...but WAY over-priced. At least $1 to $2 more than other 3rd wave coffee shops. More expensive than back home in L.A.  Austin is cool, but should not cost more than L.A.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Visiting from Chicago and decided to come here based on good reviews and was not disappointed. It is a little intimidating given the premium menu but the barista was knowledgeable and very friendly. It was a great experience!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"A fan for sure. I love this little coffee shop. My experience with Houndstooth was in the evening. The owner/manager was so sweet and talked about all the different coffees they offered, explaining the brewing process with great detail.  This tells me they are passionate about a good cup of coffee and that speaks to this coffee lover.  I went to Houndstooth for an after-dinner coffee experience and it was the perfect setting. If we wanted a fast-food type coffee run with yelling baristas, paper cups and our names spelled wrong, we would've gone to Starbucks, but we weren't looking for that type of atmosphere.  We wanted to take our time, talk, drink from a real ceramic cup, and enjoy our adult time away from the kids.  The music was great, the vibe was calm, mature, and peaceful.  I saw a few patrons enjoying a cup of coffee and reading a book; it's a great place for that.    We can't wait to return on another date night. the perfect latte",1
Coffee Shop 32,"My first visit to Houndstooth was delightful; it lives up to its reputation as one of the best coffee houses in Austin. The interior is clean, refined, and simple, as are their equipment and ceramics. The baristas were incredibly friendly and offered suggestions on different beans or blends for my espresso and cappuccino.  My espresso was brewed using Natalio Flores Ojeda, a single-origin Peruvian bean by Roseline. It had tangerine notes and was bright and pleasant. The milk chocolate flavors in the Hologram blend from Counter Culture Coffee paired well with the creamy milk in my cappuccino--just as the barista suggested it would.  All in all, one of the best coffee experiences I had in Austin. You won't be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth espresso makes my taste buds smile. I usually rotate between the cortado, latte, and cappuccino- all of which are excellent. The staff has a great attitude and is really talented with latte art that never fails to put a smile on my face. Houndstooth has limited space for studying, but is perfect for a quick drink or for togo.  I can't help but think that the placement of Tacodeli next to Houndstooth is more than a divine coincidence, but grabbing breakfast tacos and a cup of coffee has become a weekend routine for me.

I ask for half the espresso in my soy latte and it would get me going like putting jet fuel in a Honda civic. Great pourover, great selection of coffee beans, I just LOVE this place.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they are patient when I'm taking a lifetime to decide on which coffee I want.  The ambiance is also great, they have a combination of tables, couches, a large table for groups, and outside seating, so the set up can fit all your needs.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"At the barista's recommendation I purchased a small bag of their tweed coffee beans (TIMEPIECE) for $16.50.  Pretty steep price for a small bag but I heard some good things so what the heck, right???  Tried it and really didn't like it so I took the whole bag (full) back assuming they would give me a refund or at least let me exchange it.  Nope - a short, bearded guy told me ""I'm sorry Sir, what was wrong with the beans?""  Nothing other than we just didn't care for it like the barista felt we would, I told him.  The attitude on the short bearded hipster alone was enough to make me cringe at the thought of buying anything from them again.  Add the fact that they don't stand behind what they sell and I'm done.  These guys are way too proud of themselves.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"12 check-ins I am one of those people that NEED a great cup of coffee to start my day. Infact I find that the better the coffee the better the day. I try making it at home but some how it always seems to tast better at the coffee house.  I'm always in search of the perfect cup. The industrial decor alerts the consumer that Houndstooth takes their business seriously. The menu is small,  which isn't a bad thing if the product is exceptional. This place never fails to impress me. My cappacino was topped off with an adorable heart in the foam. The only issue I have is that the serving size of these cups of perfection are tiny. I honestly would need to order 3 to fulfill my desire for caffeine. (Don't judge me)  They also offer a small array of baked goods, they are tastey and seem to pair well with the coffee. All in all I like this coffee house, the staff is friendly. I could spend countless hours here people watching and getting some work done on the laptop. I'm awake now!

Coffee Shop 32,2 check-ins Nice atmosphere. Staff is very friendly. I asked how much their coffee cups were to purchase; turns out a set of two is $45!  I just had a regular iced coffee. It was pretty standard. Can't say much on their actual coffee as of yet. menu,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth! Was looking for a great coffee shop to study - I am a fidgety person and like people around me and music around me when I work. There is something to be said on the distinction of said distractions, but there definitely is such a thing as 'too distracting'.    This cafe' is the best thing that happened to me over the Summer. I love their clean decor - the focus being their coffee. They offer a distinct selection, not too vast, but then that's not the point is it? I got a great cup of beautifully brewed coffee. Simple. You can tell that the people that work there like the place too :) They made me and my friend feel welcome. The lighting is great for studying/reading. I absolutely adore their playlist AND it was at the perfect volume [for me at least :D]  Must try!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I've been to several coffee places in Austin and can say for certain, in a town extremely rich with great coffee, Houndstooth is the best I've had to date.

Coffee Shop 32,"I never cease to be amazed by the variety and quality of coffee joints in Austin. This one was no exception. Relaxed atmosphere, friendly baristas and delicious roast. What more can you ask for? My cap, begging to be enjoyed.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in {AUSTIN}. Wonderful coffee shop!  FOOD AND DRINK: (4.5/5) I ordered a vanilla cortado, and I really, really enjoyed it. It was the perfect consistency, and the espresso + milk was smooth and delectable. Everything was wonderful. They also sold a small assortment of pastries if you're hungry, but honestly, the coffee was so great. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had.  AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (5/5) Wow, wonderful, wonderful, and wonderful. The baristas were extremely friendly and helpful; they were able to help my non-coffee-drinker friends figure out exactly what they wanted. When there wasn't a line at the counter, the two baristas were always working: wiping tables, sweeping the floors, cleaning the espresso machine, etc. This would definitely explain how everything was kept so clean and orderly, and made the whole experience more enjoyable.  The ambiance is very cozy. This is a pretty small coffee shop, but full of soft light and is very quiet. Plenty of outlets along the walls, so this would be a good place to bring your work and be super productive.  PARKING: (4/5) Houndstooth shares a lot with other stores in the same plaza (including Uchiko). Unfortunately, quite a few of the parking spots are designated ""10 minutes"" or ""30 minutes"", but there should still be plenty of spots remaining if you want to stay longer. I'm just thankful that we found a coffeeshop that wasn't limited to street parking at all.  COME AGAIN?: Yes, absolutely! If I wanted to get some work done, this is definitely the place I would go. However, I'm not sure if I would come here to hang out with a friend; it's a little quiet for my taste. But there are certainly benefits for that as well. Highly recommended! latte + vanilla cortado",1
Coffee Shop 32,"This is a great coffee shop. It's a little cramped inside, but still plenty of seating. They were offering Counter Culture and Tweed coffees the morning my wife and I went in. I was disappointed that the only drip offering was a blend. We ordered two pour overs: the Konga and Idido--both single origin coffees from Counter Culture. Definitely pricey for the size--almost $5 for a 16oz and they were not filled up all the way. I'm a snob, so I'll just say that both drinks were a little diluted (I've brewed a bag of the Idido at home so I know what it's supposed to taste like). Still very good coffee though. Cool vibe, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, good selection of pastries. I would definitely recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"My favorite coffee! Wish houndstooth came to New York / California. The beans are amazing, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgable, very nice ambience, and right in between tacos and uchiko!! :) 10/10 would recommend Flat white for $4.25",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Came here with my sister and since it was a bit late, we opted for green mint iced teas. They were nice and cold but maybe we should've gotten a hot drink since the seating inside was all taken so we sat outside. You could definitely taste the minty-ness which was nice. The guy at the counter was super nice and they have little things to look at while you wait for your drink.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"16 check-ins Great little coffee shop on Lamar. I've had a couple of meetings here, and the espresso is always great. I normally get a cortado, and I never know which espresso to pick, so I generally just let them do it for me. They'll make just about any coffee drink you can think up, and they'll do it quickly. Well-lit, plenty of seating, fast wi-fi.  It seems like everyone here knows each other, or maybe everyone is just really frigging friendly, but it definitely feels like the neighborhood place where everyone knows your name.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great coffee. Baristas are coffee geeks. The roasts that were on offer were not the generic kinds; some thought had gone into their selection. Good relaxing ambience. Music was not too loud. The latest issue of Barista magazine was on the counter. Latte art was cool. Parking is tight in this complex though. This is the only place I've had a drink they call a cortado. I enjoyed it very much, and the wife enjoyed her latte. Banana bread was good as well (large enough that it must be shared). Recommended; will visit again.",1

Coffee Shop 32,"I went to the main Houndstooth store and had a great experience. I had Counter Culture's ""Jarama"" from Rwanda - Kalita wave. It was excellent! I would highly recommend their main location over the smaller shop on Congress. If you want good coffee this is the place to go.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I've been here way too many times for my own good, but Houndstooth has never disappointed me! They're very consistent with their coffee every time and it's always on point. The baristas are very friendly and helpful -- so if you have any doubts about what to order or if you want to try something new, just ask them about it and they'll be happy to help you out. They're very knowledgeable when it comes to coffee too!  It is a bit overpriced but I personally think it's worth the money. THere is a lot of foot traffic so it isn't the greatest place to get a lot of work done if you need quiet, but it's a nice place to catch up with a friend!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"One of my go-to coffee places in Austin. Great drinks, flavorful coffee, nice minimalist place with a lot of natural light.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"5 check-ins I have been going to Houndstooth constantly for years (because it's next to the best taco place in the whole universe) and I'm sadly going to disagree with some of my friends, and give them a lower rating.  Their coffee costs twice as much as Starbucks. I know Starbucks is mega-corporate non-artisinal stuff and there's better to be had, but their ubiquity sets a standard, and in my opinion, if you charge 2x as much for a standard commodity (which is open less than a block away) you should produce something significantly better than that standard. Houndstooth... well call me an uncultured swine, but in my opinion it isn't that much better, and sometimes it's worse. And I'm talking about espresso, not drip coffee... I'm not *that* much of an uncultured swine.  But besides Starbucks we could compare it to Kick-butt or Epoch ... both of those places have cheaper, better coffee and in my opinion a better atmosphere as well.  Houndstooth is constantly crowded and loud, their wi-fi is mediocre, and I don't know if there's a single plug to recharge. If you like you can sit out on the porch and listen to traffic sounds on Lamar while you chat instead of coffee shop sounds inside, but either way it doesn't strike me as having a single good spot to have the type of personal, casual conversation you'd like at a trendy coffee shop.. or even to work remotely, for that matter. (Although the MacBooks abound here--I'm actually on a MacBook, here, as I type this review.)  If it's important for you to get extra-interesting things like pourovers or coffee-cherry tea, novel imports or ""Chemex"" whatever that is, and you get it to go, maybe this can be worth the trouble and expense to you. I've really tried to love this place but it's just not happening for me.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"Really fantastic pourover. They also have KTonic Kombucha available for purchase. Great coffee bar, but this place doesn't seem very conducive to hanging out for a while. Uncomfortable stools and chairs, and music was being played through a tinny Bluetooth speaker. I'll probably take my drink to go next time.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I ordered an iced chai latte. It had a nice balance of cloves and cardamom, maybe a bit too sweet for my taste though. Besides that, it was very light, unlike Starbucks thick, syrupy chai, and delicious, would order again. Atmosphere was lively with good music.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Got the Chai. The Chai flavor was stronger than I've normally had at other coffee shops, but I appreciated it. It was a tad bit sweet though. 5 stars because my brother thinks this place is great, and I think my brother is great.",1
Coffee Shop 32,The only place in town I would order my Cortado. The best coffee in town hands down!,1
Coffee Shop 32,Delicious house roast. Staff was very pleasant and helpful! Lovely little spot to get some work done and enjoy a great cup of coffee :) Get in my tummy,1
Coffee Shop 32,Best Lattes in Austin. Over-priced? About the same as what you'd get from a Starbuck's but their coffee be burnt! I still don't get the draw except for the cool mugs in their shops. Go Local and help a small business out.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Heard about Houndstooth while living in Hawaii. After moving to Austin, was able to finally try this place out while stopping by Taco Deli. I only tried the iced coffee without sugar/cream, it was perfect! Not too bitter or too watery. I'm very picky when it comes to coffee. I've started to step away from lattes, been wanting more of the coffee taste rather than milk.  Definitely coming back to try their other brewed coffees!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I don't understand why people complain that this place is full of snobby baristas and hipsters. It's not. They serve good coffee, and they're knowledgeable about it to boot--if that somehow means they're uppity, then I guess I'm okay with that.  Anyway, I love Houndstooth! If you don't understand the coffee offerings (I rarely do, I just go in with an idea of what I feel like drinking), they are glad to explain what things are to you. There is enough seating to satisfy the place on a non-busy day, which is good. The only thing I would complain about is the lack of outlets -- so come here with your laptop charged if you plan to stay!",1
Coffee Shop 32,Love it. Been a daily customer - (sometimes more than once a day) for a while. They also have amazing banana bread and banana chocolate chip muffins. yum.,1
Coffee Shop 32,Delicious coffee and chai. Because it is in a busy area I've made sure to only go on weekdays and have gone earlier enough so I haven't had too much trouble parking. It is more expensive than some of the other coffee in town but you get what you pay for and I definitely think their coffee is more than worth it!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth has some of the best quality coffee I've ever tasted. Walking into the place, you'll see those nice shiny espresso machines that'll make you want to quit your job and become a barista.  My favorite is the Iced Vanilla Latte. Watching them make it is amazing; you can tell it's good quality coffee when it takes a while to make.  I will admit that the drinks are pricey; it's always painful taking out my wallet here. But when you have coffee as good as theirs...how can you not get some?!  The place is pretty small and it gets crowded in the afternoons. If you're here to lounge around, I would say you have a 30% chance of getting a spot. It's good for grabbing a coffee to go with a friend though.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Not a lot to add, that 277 before have not.    Superior in a head-to-head over Medici (yelp.com/biz/caffe-medic…).  Enjoyed my simple, straight up latte (no fancy business here!).    Cookie for later was tasty as well.  Small space inside the shop.  Cashier apparently rang my & brother's simple hot lattes as ""iced.""  When it was discovered as we stood stoic by the counter, no worries--they quickly made a couple hot for us.  No hassle--us or them.    Good place, slinging quality java.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Some of the reviews written for Houndstooth is funny. A bad review because the barista was lacking a smile...or a certain roast for that day?  Anyhow.. both my experiences were quite pleasant. The cortados here really do live up to its name. The baristas are knowledgable such that if you present what kind of flavor you're looking for, they may suggest a certain roast for the drink you desire.  Over the past weekend's visit, I've tasted both its iced latte and a cortado. Great stuff. The barista there even suggested me to visit Figure-8 coffee in East Austin. Another great place. Love the atmosphere. Seems to be a cyclists' hangout over the weekend mornings. Great vibe.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"LOVE! Best cappuccino I've had. Cute place and cups. If I lived closer, it would be my new hangout place. I wish it stayed open a little later.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"First thing when I visit a city... find a place that serves good coffee. So, after looking at the reviews, I headed over to Houndstooth on the first day of a four day stay in Austin and ended up going back every day.  The pourover is done with a Clever filter which is a bit different than using a Chemex. Rather than pouring the water over and letting the coffee drip into the carafe, the water is steeped in the coffee grounds in the Clever. When it's done, the coffee then drains into a glass jar and then poured into the coffee cup. In my opinion, the coffee is a bit more robust than a simple pourover done with a Chemex  What Houndstooth does well is finding great coffee beans from some of the best roasters in the US - Counterculture, PT's, etc. I enjoyed some Amore de Dios (the love of God in Spanish) from CC and it was nothing short of amazing.  The only downside to Houndstooth are the pastries. We tried a couple of scones on the first day and they were just ok. But frankly, when you can head next door to Tacodeli, it's a huge win... great coffee and a breakfast taco!!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"11 check-ins I love Houndstooth Coffee. The baristas have been consistently pleasant from my morning experiences, the rotating coffee specials are always great picks and yummy flavors, and they have a great house coffee. They DO offer cappuccinos, but this isn't really the place for those. Their prices are a little bit higher than some of the other places in town but I think the tastes are by far better.  Rotating coffee specials are on the left when approaching the register and their major notes are listed to make choosing easier. Same with espressos, which are served with a small glass of (I think) Topo Chico for cleansing the palette, according to my friend Helen.  It's definitely different from other ""coffeeshops"" in that I'm not sure I feel too comfortable studying here for extended periods of time--the word I would describe it with isn't exactly ""cozy.""  Warm even? No. Enjoyable and modern, but in the tiniest bit I'd compare it to Medici in terms of feel tables and chairs-wise. I'd say it's a Hudson, a Brannan, or maybe a Walden whereas some other coffeeshops would be something like Kelvin or Valencia. Yeah.. I went there.",1
Coffee Shop 32,One of my favorite coffee shops in Austin! Love that it's conveniently wedged in between Uchiko and Taco Deli!  If only Houdstooth would come to New York...! :),1
Coffee Shop 32,"I really like Houndstooth, but I don't hit them up as much as I'd like. I've never had a bad experience here either. Here's my brief list.  Pros: Fantastic coffee Tasty pastries Nice Baristas Nice Decor  Cons: Parking Busy environment during the day  Check them out if you're around!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I stumbled into this place this morning, looking for a delicious cappuccino to wake me up. Houndstooth didn't disappoint. They're a multi-roast coffee shop, so there are a few different bean options. I went with one called Koava for my cappo, and it was perfect. The right ratio of milk to espresso (aka not too much milk. Ahem, Starbucks), and a great machine that made the espresso the correct way (not burnt).  The people there were really friendly. The atmosphere was okay...not exactly a cozy place but nice enough. Pricing wise-a little steep. My cappo was 4.80. The coffee was great though so I'll come back again.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins Be patient if you order coffee using the pour-over method; perfection takes time and quite honestly there's no need to rush a good cup of coffee.  I order today's brew, Amor de Dios or the Love of God. It has a dark roast look to it but tastes smooth as a light roast. One sip and I felt like I got un abrazo de Dios this morning. It's a great brew made even better with a pour-over. I'm definitely going to buy this brew to take home. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about coffees and brew methods. It's a small space but has plenty of seats for an average crowd. Nice art work.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Great coffee and great people.  Lots of large windows in the front of the coffee shop--great to soak in the sunshine.  (There is less sunny seating in the back section).  Mmm so many tasty selections to choose from... Macchiato love,1
Coffee Shop 32,"I went in, looking for a place to loiter for a bit, and was easily convinced to order the summer time special: coffee julep. Its (I think) a shot of espresso, sparkling water, simple syrup, and mint poured over ice. I don't think I'd order it again because it was kind of expensive for such a small amount of liquid, but it was much better than I anticipated. Its in a great location, has a lot of seating, and they even have some pastries in case you're hungry. Definitely a fan, and will probably go back.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Before I begin my review, I just want to say that I am by no means a coffee connoisseur! Hand picked Colombian coffee house roasted and freshly ground vs instant coffee tastes basically the same to me. As a result I basically like my coffee 10% coffee, 40% milk, and 50% sugar. Therefore, I normally just drown any coffee given to me in copious amounts of sugar, honey, and sweetener (yay diabeetus).  BUT my experience at houndstooth was mucho different-o. I ordered a vanilla latte with Rustico espresso (i have no idea what that is but the friendly barista recommended it). Just as I was about to nuke it with sugar, I decided to give it a sip first. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM much taste, such good! Didn't even need sugar. I believe that's truly a testament to the quality of Houndstooth coffee. So far its the best quality coffee I have tried in Austin!  Other notes: This place is very cozy, but its a downright terrible place if you want to get work done. It's quite loud, has like zero outlets, and very few actual tables. Come here to chat and enjoy good coffee. Don't bother trying to study!  Overall: I loved the coffee, but I probably won't be a regular. $5.10 for a small cup of coffee is to luxurious for a poor college student D:",1
Coffee Shop 32,I got The Jo & Jam and my boyfriend got a single origin Kenyan espresso shot. We both really liked our drinks! The atmosphere was great as well. The only thing is that it's a little pricey it came out to $11! Other than that it was fine! The staff was awesome and would still come here again!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"This location is great! Came here to get some work done and there is plenty of seating indoor and outside, free wifi, outlets and a huge variety of teas and coffee as well as pastries, sandwiches, and juice. They also sell Wild Gift beans if you are looking for something to brew at home.  The aesthetics are pretty on point here; it reminds me of a more sophisticated, less-basic Starbucks- in a good way actually. The baristas are nice and helpful, and there is enough light in the store for good Instagrams as well. There is a couch in one corner that is perfect for socializing or reading the newspaper, and bar seating as well as small tables perfect for your laptop. Honestly just a really pretty shop.  The coffee is also good! I ordered a cap and it came with a small piece of pastry which was a sweet start to my morning! Caffe Medici always gives me the sense of Austin coffee shop community so overall it's a great place to get work done and enjoy a cup of coffee. Inside! Very modern! Latte art on point",1
Coffee Shop 8,"The parking would get a zero stars but this isn't about parking. Not all coffee shops can have parking lots. This coffee shop has very nice staff that answered all my question I had about their menu and is very knowledgeable when it comes to making a perfect coffee. In my case I asked for a latte, but I am sure they are perfect with every other coffee you can ask for. Even that I took my sweet time, they didn't want to hurry me as coffee takes it time and to choose the right one also can take a minute or two. You never want to go for the wrong one. The place itself has different tables and such and I sat down at a bar type table. The comfy ones were already taken and I didn't want to re-seat.  On a side note, they have some water ready to get it yourself, and reusable water cups, I like that. Together with the real cups this would give them an extra point but I can only give five points all together.  I will be back if I find parking in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great coffee shop so unique, kind of getting tired of the white plain uncomfortable coffee shops this place has a good balance of comfy seating with leather booth type seating and areas for studying. The walls are really artsy and designed well with some wood paneling and wall papers that make it a relaxing ambiance. Good overall lay out with the espresso bar centered in full view. They have outside seating as well.  They do have kombucha by the bottle three flavors very tasty.  Had a cortada which was perfect. Customer service was excellent.  Only downfall is this is a busy area, hardly any parking on a Friday night. See all photos from Amy M. for Caffé Medici",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I was wandering around the Lamar complex killing time before an event and was feeling a little sleepy.  Being a nurse, coffee is my life blood, so I stopped by this hip little cafe and ordered up a latte.  I love that here, that doesn't mean an overly sweet confection like those chain places.  I do love a non-sweet hand pulled latte and this was a good one!  There is plenty of seating in the cafe and the decor is very urban industrial, think resto hardware, but lots of little pockets and alcoves for an intimate conversation. Outside, there are plenty of tables, benches and ledges to perch on while you enjoy a baked treat or a sip of tea or a cup of joe. If it wasn't so far from my home base, I'd definitely be back more often. Sidewalk/patio area Lovely latte",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This is a great place to sit and get some things done on your laptop, or visit with friend, or read with a hot latte after dinner. Casual atmosphere, pleasant people, awesome coffee, great staff. I'll be back! Comfortable and cool atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Love at first sip? I would have to agree! I am so happy with my coffee I am typing my review at the coffee shop right now. The ambience is a little hipsterish but has it own uniqueness to it. Each wall is different to include box picture selves with displays of artwork.  Bonus they also serve beer!!!!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"This place is legit! Their coffee is amazing. I ordered an iced coffee which as simple as it sounds was incredible.  Yeah! If I lived in Austin, I'd go here all the time. The place itself is a very stylish coffee shop. Parking is kinda hard at times but atleast the parking garage is free.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I had an americano and it was great! I tried to work on my laptop, but the internet quality was poor. They tried to fix it, but didn't help. Other people were having internet troubles too. Great atmosphere and plenty of comfortable seating everywhere including outside. In the plaza with shake shack, high ball and at least four other restaurants. Lick ice cream right next door and smoothie place.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I love Caffe Medici! I usually go to the location on Guadalupe across UT Austin, but I came here with my family for a late afternoon coffee since we were in the neighborhood. You get what you'd expect from Medici: friendly service, a modern-yet-cozy ambiance, and damn good coffee. I just got a normal drip coffee this time I went, and it well-outperforms its competitors even in this department. They really do use high quality coffees and brew with care; the product reflects it. My coffee (which I had black, no cream or sugar) was smooth, fruity, and hardly astringent whatsoever. I'm glad to see that no matter which location you go to, you can experience the same great product!  Also, while their store may not have the most seating, they make up for it with a generous amount of outdoor seating. And this is really a nice place to have outdoor seating; there are enough pedestrians and great, ""urban"" views.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Fun vibe to this trendy coffee spot! Tried the iced americano and not disappointed. Worth checking out!,1
Coffee Shop 8,I have only been here once and it was a great experience. This place has a eclectic design to it. That meaning random mirrors and decor everywhere. Is that a bad thing? absolutely not. Now the coffee I got was an ice coffee but not just any ice coffee cold brew. OH but not just cold brew a concentrated one where milk is added and vanilla sweetener. So yes it put a pep in my step and it was really good to wash my smash burger down. I high recommend that kind of cold brew. They have a regular cold brew as well. I will be back if Im ever back in austin.  also apparently a great place to do computer work and homework.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great vibe, good coffee, great prices on the wines by the bottle as well.  This location opens very late so if you're trying to get some work done late at night, this is the place to be. Wifi is also very fast and reliable.  Parking has always been a hassle though. It's in the same complex as the Alamo Drafthouse so it does take a while to find a spot.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Super swanky coffee shop. Awesome staff. Amazing location! Outdoor seating, tons of indoor seating. Cool chill music. I wish I lived here, I'd work from here everyday! Chai",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in But first, coffee. I may have have found THE spot, you guys.  This coffee shop has 3 things every coffee shop need: good coffee, fast Wifi, and great ambience. I was sold.  This location just opened and for a Monday evening, it was quite empty. The baristas were friendly and greeted us when we came in. I ordered what I usually get - an Iced Vanilla Latte. The prices are kind of steep, but my coffee was a perfect combination of espresso & milk, so I think it's quite worth.  I do wish they have more pastry options though~  Plenty of seats, outlets, and there's even a cute little patio outside!  You can park in the parking garage for Alamo Drafthouse.  Be expecting me often! Interior Iced Vanilla Latte Menu See all photos from Bao N. for Caffé Medici",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Coffee Shop Working One of my favorite places to work. Great music, really friendly staff.",1
Coffee Shop 8,So cool that they serve craft beers and coffee here! Cute little spot that just opened in their up-and-coming trendy area. I enjoy the music here very much and I could totally see myself coming here to study or hang out. Macchiato with almond milk,1
Coffee Shop 8,"They have a very small selection of drinks, plus some pastries and pre-wrapped sandwiches and snacks. It's a good place to study or hang out before a movie at the Alamo. The interior is decorated very well. There's not that much available seating so come early! Drinks were around $4-6, a little on the expensive side.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Beautiful location and decor. Strolled in after brunch at Vox for much needed caffeine fix. The staff is friendly and the coffee was wonderful. I drink my coffee black and enjoy really tasting the actual coffee and I must say they do an amazing job. I don't get the burnt taste like most national chain coffee shops. Great coffee and snacks, friendly staff and beautiful location",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This place will change your coffee-loving life. It's usually my first and last stop when visiting Austin. The staff is super friendly, you never get that café snob vibe from them at all, and they genuinely care about the quality of your drink. The atmosphere is very trendy and modern but completely welcoming and comfortable. The best cup of coffee you'll get in Austin, hands down.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Give me coffee or give me death! I like this location more because it's near the Alamo Drafthouse, which is a great place to wait before the movie starts. Also you can go there after the film is over and hang out. There's also free parking which is a major plus. Medici is a fancy coffeehouse with modern furniture. In the middle of the coffeehouse is where the counter where the espresso machine is located and you can order your drinks. You have to go to the left part of the counter and you pick up your drink at the opposite counter. There are couches you can sit, tall tables, and there's outside patio sitting. Nice place to go hang out or work on your laptop. Free wifi and parking. You can't go wrong with this place.",1
Coffee Shop 8,I like to bring clients here. The atmosphere is fantastic! The staff is always very friendly. I highly recommend this place. Great place to get work done. Delicious!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Medici is my very favorite coffee house.  My daughter and I are addicted to the Latte with almond milk.  The flavor is rich, creamy and sets the bar for a latte.   Apparently they have a special almond milk that sets them apart from the other coffee houses. The decor is clean and natural with an artsy feel.   Defiantly MY coffee house every time I am in the vicinity.  Luckily, I get my hair done with Mandy  next door.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Latte art aside, the milk was warmed perfectly. You can tell because the milk is sweet and creamy and at a drinkable temperature right when served. The staff here is friendly, and the garage nearby helps with the parking situation. Indoor and outdoor seating to suit your preference, and well lit for studying.  Only thing is that I wish there were more choices on pastries. Maybe I came at a bad time or they sold out so maybe next time. Beer + coffee spot",1
Coffee Shop 8,Excellent cappuccino. Good casual ambience. Comfortable couches. Could use some paper magazines or books or board games though. Gourmet coffee beans available for purchase. Will be back.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins Ordered a iced latte and it was on point. The coffee is amazing. Enjoyed every sip. The staff is great. Did not have to wait long.  If your a coffee lover, like I am, this place is worth a shot.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"First, let me say that I have been to other Medici locations in Austin and had good experiences with pretty quality coffee.  My wife and I are avid coffee drinkers, drinking coffee two to three times a day.  We just moved into Lamar Union, the apartment building that this coffee shop is in and I was excited about having this place within quick walking distance!  You know, wake up and grab a coffee or come home from work and grab one, or hell drink them all day when I work from home a couple times a week.    Unfortunately for me, my first and last experience at this location made it so I will not come back. Not only that, but I don't think I will be going to their other locations either.  There are a lot of options in Austin and if I have to drive to get to another shop like Irie Bean or Patika on Lamar then I will.  I walked into the store before work one day and asked for some black coffee with room.  I indicated I wanted one of the central American roasts and the barista said it would take five minutes to make that order happen.  I was not upset by this at all, sometimes that happens.  So, I changed my order to an Americano with 3 shots and thats when things when wrong.    He informed me that they just could not possibly ever do that.. because their machine pours two at once.  I had a choice of two or four.  I asked if he could.. split the shot.. maybe pour half the second shot in and I would pay for four.  But noooo, they do not do that... their policy is two or four.  This being early in the morning and me having married a woman that was a barista all the way through college and someone that drinks coffee two to three times a day, told him politely I would find somewhere else to go.  So, I left and found a shop that would be willing to do what I asked with my drink that I am paying for.  Doesn't seem like a big deal and it isn't really in day to day life. However, with so many other quality places I do not have time to deal with coffee snobs who are unwilling to let me drink what I want if I am not asking for something insane.",0
Coffee Shop 8,I walk by this place every Sunday when I get my paper.  Finally stopped and got an almond croissant. It was a little over priced and a little dry.,0
Coffee Shop 8,This Caffé Medici is located near the Alamo draft house on South Lamar. It's a perfect place to go if your looking for somewhere to chill before a movie or a quiet place to study. Every Caffé Medici is very consistent on how their coffee taste and that's what I love about this coffee shop!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Good coffee, friendly staff, both indoor and outdoor seats. Slightly crowded seats, but good enough if all you want is to grab your laptop and get some work done.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"So happy they built one walking distance from me! I was a frequent at the one in Clarksville but now I'm two blocks away. I have been to this store once and the service was great. I had only ever had their hot lattes and it was way too hot for that so I asked for recommendations for something cold and highly caffeinated. They gave me an iced toddy and it was perfect. Not too sweet, not too bland, and you could taste the strength. I finished it before I made it back to my apartment and then drank some of my friends'. Only thing I'll say, in typical American fashion, is larger sizes, plz?!!! Lol",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I have been coming by here quite often lately.  Great place to take have an espresso, take a breather or have a meeting.  Glad its close by.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"As I consider the vision that Cafe Medici holds, I continually find aspects of their business model that I appreciate. They don't need to have so many shops, in so many locations that necessitate high real estate premiums... yet they want to provide a common space for friends and family to gather in high-traffic areas in the city of Austin.  My friend and I considered their revenue-cost ratio and figured that this local institution could bankroll with one shop, charging a lot more in one location in which all of their efforts are directed. If you think about it, the coffee prices haven't changed much over the years... sometimes keeping things simple create the most convenience for the people in charge.  Yet, Medici provides the city with consistently good service, fair pricing, fantastic coffee... and quite the fiasco looking for parking in the vicinity of all 4 locations. I love what these guys are up to.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Cool spot great brew...what else does one really need to know! Ok, great cold brew coffee and service too!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"The best thing about my visit here was the barrista. He was very nice. Sadly the rest of the experience was very lackluster. They had almost NO bakery products left by the time we got there (about 1pm on a Saturday), almost no table space and very few non-coffee drink selections. They do get a plus for some nice outdoor seating (benches that create a cozy spot). If they could expand their menu and keep better stock of their pastries it could be a much better place.",0
Coffee Shop 8,Traditional coffee so don't try none of that starsucks bull round here. I only dropped in for a macchiato and a chai real quick but I gotta say the design and the atmosphere. It's so relaxed and has an authentic feel to it. The service was fast and organized. The staff seem to know their stuff. Loving my drink as well. I just like its out of place location and music choice. I'd like more variety on the menu but that's it really.,1
Coffee Shop 8,Had caramel latte its was ok.. The drink was not warm enough. Didn't feel good after the drink.,0
Coffee Shop 8,"What can I saw that really matters other than the fact that there coffee is excellent? The interior design's aesthetic is interesting and fresh, and the staff is helpful and friendly. These things are absolutely essential, but come secondary to the quality and execution of the coffee and drinks. Thank you for an excellent cup!",1
Coffee Shop 8,First to Review I had a awesome fresh croissant and a great craft beer! Can't wait to come back for their awesome coffee. Smells so amazing in here all the the time!!,1
Coffee Shop 8,Great coffee. Relaxed atmosphere. Rarely over-crowded. Just a great neighborhood cup.,1
Coffee Shop 26,"What a beautiful and fun hangout! Just a few quiet blocks away from home in my new neighbourhood, Flitch is a true gem. Knowing a LITTLE about east Austin, it felt a little off the beaten path and QUIET, which is perfect (who the hell wants to go to a noisy coffee shop...BEFORE you've had your coffee??). The little trailer is absolutely ADORABLE, and the fact that you actually go inside it to order is fun. Everything tastes fresh; it was also nice that I could get my latte made with almond milk. Yay! My favourite part was the outdoor seating area... dozens of tables, chairs, and benches, some shaded, made for a heavenly morning on a mild and sunny November day. Great way to wake up in a cheery mood. :)",1
Coffee Shop 26,"7 check-ins The coffee is excellent and I just love to hang out here. What more could you want? :)  The espresso drinks and cold brew are really delicious. And if you are looking for a sweet, delectable treat, get the iced latte with maple syrup in it! They also carry Tyson's tacos which is a big plus.  Erica the owner and usual barista is super friendly and makes great stuff. Her dog Jake is a super sweet pup that is always hanging out on the trailer's deck. Speaking of the trailer, what a beautifully outfitted thing. She found it on Craigslist and her boyfriend, now hubby (congrats y'all) of neighboring Hatch Workshop created a super cool, wood-paneled interior. I believe he also made the awesome furniture you can use outside.  The ginormous pecan tree that easily provides shade for the entire seating area is a huge perk. I love Tillery Street's greenery, which provides a wonderful backdrop for you to enjoy as you sip your drink. I can't wait to spend more time here, especially as it cools down more this Winter!",1
Coffee Shop 26,"7 check-ins Such an adorable trailer tucked away in East Austin! I love this spot because it's quiet and peaceful and there is plenty of outdoor seating, good for a date or an outing with some girlfriends.  Their iced maple latte is probably the best flavored iced latte in Austin in my opinion. It has a light but sweet flavor that doesn't overpower the coffee. Their hot espresso drinks are also good.  Not to mention, the owner's dog is the cutest! Overall the vibes this trailer gives off and the great coffee they serve makes this a definite new favorite. They also give out free postcards!",1
Coffee Shop 26,"4 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Flitch and Fleet are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you care? Trust Ms Foster's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Flitch was out right before a Sunday closing, and I only had remnants from a late Tuesday morning one. But I did think my $2.50 Americano was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of a Spartan & tables, it's easy to park, and this area of Tillery street may be the last non-gentrified oasis in East Austin - hey, isn't that Jake Crane the Coffeedog? Flitch takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. Flitch is located just south of the Tillery St Plant Co, where I thought it was going to be for some inexplicable reason. 3-4 people can sit inside the renovated Spartan, but think outside picnic tables if you're planning to hang. That's my cup, btw.",1
Coffee Shop 26,The coffee was great and so was the atmosphere. I had the maple latte and my sister had the chai tea. My latte was perfection and the chai my sis said it was one of the best she has ever had. Thank you Flitch coffee for your wonderful coffee and service. Can't get over how cute and simple the logo was. Super talented barista. Maple latte,1
Coffee Shop 26,Good iced coffee. Good service. Nice area to hang out with plenty of parking. Sucks that it's so hot in Texas.,1
Coffee Shop 26,"2 check-ins A short walk through a leafy green street in east Austin, yielded an unexpected coffee trailer in the large parking lot of a working hardware garage.  Misplaced next to an old gray cottage, with piles of fresh lumber stacked on metal tables, acting as sculpture, in this big concrete lot a quite serene tree shaded patio in the corner provided a sound meditative space for coffee and chat, as roosters crowed, ducks quacked in nearby neighbors yards, while soft sounds of construction parlayed in the back ground of this rapidly growing east austin neighborhood.  ""We're the only coffee shop this side of Pleasant Valley"", the poised pale and pretty smiling Chicago gal that wo-mans this trailer informed me as she poured my triple Americano in her simple but woodsy decor outfitted metal trailer.  I scored a strawberry pop tart from Luckys and found a cinder block to perch on for a cigarette away from the communal patio as locusts churred and birds chirped, and I sipped on a bright, acidic coffee that didn't quit taste like the full rich body of espresso but rather an excellently brewed coffee revealing a tasty bean.  The remoteness of the spot is in fact one of its high points, so come grab an easy cup from this 3 month young coffee trailer if you want to escape the brouhaha of funky east side.  Coffee and pastries Coffee trailer See all photos from Scott L. for Flitch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 26,The only thing that MIGHT surpass the espresso at Flitch Coffee is the top-notch customer service.,1
Coffee Shop 26,Sweet little spot for a quality beverage break. The iced teas are exceptional. The casual outdoor environment is full of artistic and warm touches.,1
Coffee Shop 26,"Deeeeeelicious espresso (and other stuff but I've only had the espresso based drinks) out of a trailer in a parking lot. There are lots of trees around and the street Flitch is on feels a lot older than a lot of other parts of town. I've only ever gotten my coffee to go but there is a little tiny space to sit inside the trailer, and lots of outdoor seating. Plenty of off street parking and some parking in the little lot they're in, too. They have tacos from Tyson's tacos and some baked goods, too.  If I enjoyed hanging out at coffee establishments I'd probably hang out here.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Amazing coffee and a friendly Austin vibe make Flitch a must-go. Housed in a tastefully customized Airstream, you can choose to sip your yummy drink inside the lovely tiny-house-like trailer, or sprawled out under trees in the courtyard patio. It's located on the grounds of woodwork emporium Hatch, which means you sometimes get a peek at people making some very cool woodwork while walking up to the trailer. Park on Holton St for easy side access. And they have tacos in the morning too!!",1
Coffee Shop 26,"This is a magical little wonderland of what Austin should be about. Clean and sleek design that also draws you in to sit and relax- it reminds me of the Chelsea Highline in NYC. The trailer is so welcoming and homey without being informal, and I love that you walk inside to order. The owner is a spectacularly nice person, and it's a real treat to chat her up when I visit.  The real reason one goes back to a coffee place is of course, the coffee.  This is the ONLY place I know of in Texas to get a Maple Latté and I don't even have to bring my own maple syrup. Which I have done. So there. The espresso is rich and full but not bitter or acrid, the presentation is spot on. I love nothing more than a mapley, foamy, espresso-milk mustache, decorated with THE most perfect latte art.  My dog wants to put in his two cents:  ""Jake the dog is my friend. He works at this trailer too. We like to lie on the porch at Flitch and look at each other. Jake is nice. He smells like coffee and sunshine.""  I think that sums it up nicely.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Super cute local business run by a warm and genuine young woman. Great environment to do work or to sit and talk with friends. Love the yard space, but the seating in the airstream is nice and cozy. They even have a mini art gallery inside. A must go! Having fun at flitch!",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Damn good. Cool outdoor vibe with plenty of parking and pleeeeenty of seating. I got the Americano and it was very well done. Nothing crazy unique about the coffee itself, just very well executed.",1
Coffee Shop 26,Excellent and delicious options! Sticks makes a yummy Maple Latte and is fun to talk to****,1
Coffee Shop 26,"I stopped at El Chilito one morning for a taco and a coffee. Got in my truck and headed east down 7th. The El Chilito coffee was so bad I couldn't drink it. Luckily, at about 7th and Pleasant Valley, I remembered a friend's instagram post about Flitch Coffee. I stopped in, got a small coffee, and left. Was there for about 30 seconds. Cute trailer, great vibe, etc, but I was in a hurry. Got in my truck, sipped my coffee, and was blown away by how good it was. I think this is the best cup of coffee I've had in Austin. Very impressed. Will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"What a cool place! Real baristas not relying on automated machines, it makes a difference. Outside seating has a great atmosphere. I don't live close, but the other patrons gave a sincere sense of community. Almost everyone knew each other which was cool to witness.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"First to Review Erica at Flitch Coffee is a talented barista and a visionary who has brought excellent coffee and a special neighborhood addition to this part of East Austin. She has set up shop in a beautiful 1955 Spartan trailer that sits in front of Hatch Workshop and is accompanied by her dog Jake Crane. My husband and I came here on opening day and we have been returning since. We recently stopped by earlier today with some friends both in and from out of town and they all concurred that Erica serves some of the best lattes in Austin. Her latte art is also on point. Enough said. This place is hard to miss, and there's a spacious parking lot. Delicious (and gorgeous) almond milk latte Erica, the neighborhood's fave barista and coffee shop owner See all photos from Ji K. for Flitch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Love the set up, love the wood concept. It's my kind of atmosphere jam for sure. Quiet and cozy, tucked away in an east side Austin neighborhood. I was more fascinated with the RV and its unique design than the menu, but the green tea I had was fantastic! No need for honey! I can't wait to try their coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 26,Favorite coffee spot in Austin! Erica is so nice and friendly and the coffee is delicious! Lots of outdoor seating plus it's dog and kid friendly. It's the perfect place to hang out on a Saturday morning with your dogs. We are so lucky this is within walking distance from our house!,1
Coffee Shop 26,"Great new shop down the street from the office. Restored Spartan trailer, great coffee from texas and Wisconsin roasters. Erica and Jake the coffee dog can't be nicer.  Go get a real coffee here soon.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"I love this coffee shop, whenever I'm in town I make special trips to hang out before I start my day. Friendly atmosphere with I huge tree overhead and nestled next to a furniture shop that made the custom interiors and outdoor furniture. On top of all that, the coffee is incredible.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"This place is awesome! Tons of outdoor seating, and the iced tea is to die for. If they have the Turkish Mint, do yourself a favor and get some. Prices are also totally reasonable, you could even say they're on the cheaper end of reasonable. Bottom line, go here!",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Flitch Coffee is so choice. Erica is really warm and sweet. Plus, who doesn't like an independent, literally built from the ground up, coffee trailer?",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Erica is great!  ,,,and she makes a great Americano.  I had the pleasure of visiting Flitch Coffee when I visited Austin for the first time.  I was brought here by a friend of mine that lived locally.  Come on by if you what a great coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 26,"Erica is awesome, and makes a flawless cappuccino, although over the summer I've been going for the iced drinks. Her cold brew is my favorite in town - not too strong, not too bitter - and the funky iced teas she picks are pretty tasty too.",1
Coffee Shop 26,"I love the vibe of this coffee shop here in East Austin... Great people, easy conversations... and the drinks are very solid.  I will be a regular customer.",1
Coffee Shop 26,It would be easy to drive past this tucked -away coffee spot - but don't!   The awesome craft coffee and perfect outdoor seating make for a great spot for either lingering or a quick pick-up.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Medici oh Medici, you're the medicine to my happiness!!!!!! I think I've just fallen in love with you!!!!  29hrs of no sleep and counting! I lost count of how much caffeine I have consumed so far today! Dead tired! Hungry af! Cranky from all of the above plus the disappointment of more misses than hits when it comes to my exploration for latte art in Austin so far. I was determined to change that after my last failed attempt looking for latte art. Plus I'm pretty delirious right now to give a fudge how many cup of coffee I have had today.  Yep, writing review for Medici while still sitting here sipping on the amazing almond milk cappuccino. I'm not drunk, just hyper, so you can still trust my words ;).  I wanted to jump seeing they offer STEVIA along with cane sugar, and brown sugar!!!! First coffee shop I have been to so far that has STEVIA option!!!!! They don't put any kind of sweetener in the latte, so I can adjust the sweet level to my liking!! Another huge point!!!  Little things matter a lot and always add up y'all!!!! They just made my night with great coffee, STEVIA, again, and the cutest/best touch complimentary tiny cookie that comes on the side with the cappuccino!!! It's delicious too!!!!  Parking is a lil pain in the ass, but just do neighborhood parking, don't park in any of the Laundry's parking spots next door or your car will get towed. Seating and coffee are definitely worth the little trouble!!!! Sugar! Brown sugar!! N STEVIA!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!! Delicious almond milk cappuccino!! Pretty latte art!!!! Finally!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great coffee in a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Okay, so I'm a little biased because I can walk here, plus I had my first date with the love of my life here, BUT for real, they make some damn good coffee drinks. These guys know their coffee, and will create your perfect beverage. The small, cozy cottage (Medici's first location) is a great place to spend a leisurely morning reading the newspaper and enjoying conversation with your squad. They have Taco Deli tacos (who doesn't these days?) and local pastries. And for all you vegans out there, they use the GOOD almond milk. Keep an ear out for your drink because this isn't Starbucks (thank goodness) and they don't take names.  This place is my go to for coffee and is worth the drive if you're not from the 'hood. The fine folks at Medici will make sure you get your caffeine fix.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins One of the few coffee shops that plays new era/ oldie for background music. It is very relaxing and easy to focus on getting stuff done. Plenty of seating inside and outside (can be very hot), wifi is solid and stable. Caffe medici is a great place for you to get things done!  Not many parking spots available, 3 parking spots at the back of the building. Street parkings are available but it can be hard to find sometimes.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Really freakin good coffee. The sad thing is that I have had so much good coffee on this trip that the awesomeness is all running together. They make a great latte and use Wild Gift coffee like most of the other good shops in town. The best thing is that they have parking so you can get your coffee and not hunt for a spot.,1
Coffee Shop 8,I loved it. quaint place where you could trade books. cookies were so good that my husband had to have 2 so I could share one. The places is small but cozy. The restaurant has a bookshelf in the back  where you can bring a book to exchange it for another book.It lost a star because I was not aware you could not tacos there after 1130 am. The staff was incredible there. Original location.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins Listed in Did someone say coffee?, Best cafes to study at Parking lot with 5+ spots. Check   Outlets. Check Music/noise level. Check Decent coffee/espresso drinks. Check 5 stars for ambience! This is now my favorite go-to place to study!  Stopped by this location because I was already in the neighborhood and decided to check it out instead of driving to my usual coffee shop - and I'm so glad I did.  This might just be the quaintest coffee shop I've been! It's like that cottage you dream of moving to one day but cannot for reasons like.. life. But now you can! Sort of. Okay you don't get the cottage to yourself, but it's so peaceful that it felt like so.  I was lucky enough to grab a window seat (there're prob only 2 desks that don't get a window view) and enjoyed the serene view of rainy Austin when I needed a break from work. Everyone around me seemed to be enthralled in their work as well (they may be checking Fb but looked real professional even so), so it's conducive to work.  This location is unique in that it's definitely Austin-y, but without going overboard (remember those uncomfortable but cool-looking furniture from that one shop? Or two?) So why only 4 stars? I'd give 10 stars for ambience! But held back by Yelp's 5 star system and their espresso. As it's a coffee shop, the final rating should be about the coffee. And 4 stars keep away the crowd away, right? ;P Cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 8,Coffee was really great quality! Coffee shop can be somewhat quiet but it's a great place for needed to get a away and study!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"3 check-ins Gold standard cappuccino.  There isn't a place in Austin that serves a better cappuccino than Medici. Solid. I almost never order 2 when I'm working from a coffee shop ... except when I'm at Medici. Really sweet folks who work the bar. It's pretty packed throughout the day, but around 4:30, starts clearing out. Great little patio and lots of folks hang out there and work. At one point in my workday, I peer out the window and see a woman....with her very large per iguana perched on her table. You know. A lizard has got to get their people watch on too. I like the music. It's not obnoxious, it's not too loud. Yeah....that happened. Keep Austin weird y'all.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Super cute coffee shop built inside a older home, Cafe Medici is small, well lit and comfortable. I'm a big fan of sofa's in coffee shops- and this one has one that we kept our eye on for a while till it was free. For a small place it was still a relaxing spot to sit and read on a Sunday morning. The coffee was strong and tasty. Some outdoor seating for those that can deal with Austin heat. Worth a try for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Immensely enjoyed my morning at Medici's--an outstanding cup of black coffee, a delightful cappuccino, great atmosphere, and friendly service. Medici's accommodated the morning work-out crowd, the easy-Saturday-morning folks on their laptops or with their books, and little tots and their precious parents. Teamed with a friendly smile from the staff and melodious coffee, it made for a very pleasant morning. Get your coffee fix at Medici's! Delightful Medici cappuccino.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Cool, quiet, cute coffee shop with very good coffee and good wifi.  You can sit inside or outside.  Inside, there are a variety of tables to sit at, as well as a comfy couch.  The decor has lots of dark wood.  They have various pastries and other foods for sale, which looked good, but which I didn't get to try.  They also have self-service water which is convenient.  They have a parking lot, but it's not big and can get packed.  So walk or ride your bike here, if you can.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Best of Austin There is also a Medici on Congress, but this is the original Clarksville location!  Very cute - lots of indoor seating and outdoor seating!    Very friendly baristas!  Has beautiful pastries and Tacodeli tacos!  Has a parking lot!  Good coffee - delicious cappuccinos and cortados!    Good place to sit and study or hang out with friends! Cappuccino to go",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Sometimes, maybe it's just me, but feels just in the edge of snobby.  But ignoring that. Really nice quiet comfortable place to have either a great coffee or a beer.  Don't forget the chocolate croissant :)",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Absolutely love this place. I come here all the time with my wife to pick up our routine coffee and tacos. I was especially impressed with their service yesterday. We ran out of coffee at home and I wanted to bring home a bag of their beans (La Famiglia). Unfortunately, the only bags they had were too large, but the barista happily opened one and made me a smaller, 16 oz bag. He then gave us one of our coffees for free, and also ground the beans for me (I have a hand-grinder at home, so that can be pretty tedious).  Didn't even mention their coffee, but it is INCREDIBLE. The Medici folks know how to make fantastic espresso.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This was the best cup of coffee I've had made for me in about 6 months, but only because I don't remember any coffee experiences prior to 6 months. So it's quite possible this could be a ""best cup of coffee ever"" scenario and I just don't know any better. So we'll give it 5 stars and adjust every 6 months, cool?  I don't think I've had any head trauma, I just don't remember. So if it isn't the best cup you've had in 7 months, I apologize for this claim, but I've made it pretty clear there's no coffee memory before the 6 month mark.  You know what, I'm going to take a star away due to how uncomfortable I felt hovering by someone's table while I was standing in line. There really is no good way to stand in a line of 4 or more people considering how congested this spot can get (remember, best coffee within 6 months of coffee brain history). I mean, there was someone trying to eat a croissant and I was practically looming over them. You can't enjoy a croissant that way! I mean, I guess you could, but probably not in this context.  Despite the poor line traffic pattern, the spot felt calm for how many people were in here. It was just a light hum of human activity, no boisterous people were present today. Except outside. Where there's lots of seating. I sat on a rock bench. It was nice.  Except for the guy talking about how to make aioli or some sort of special mayonnaise; he was the worst. But everything else was nice.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Modest coffee shop with delicious coffee. I was very impressed with the bold, woody flavor. They also serve breakfast tacos from Taco Deli. (I think it was Taco Deli)",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Friendly, fast, neat atmosphere. Great coffee. Just the right amount of hipster patrons to let you know it's authentic.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Perfect little coffee bar in Clarksville. Be careful during peak hours, parking may be difficult!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I haven't tasted a better cup of mocha in town yet, and this town has some amazing coffee shops. The parking can be horrible, but that's because it's tucked away in the heart of downtown Austin. The atmosphere is great, always compelling art on the walls, and the baristas have always been great. I highly recommend the mocha- it's sinfully decadent. The caramel is made in house so the caramel latte is beyond tasty. I'm a classic latte kinda girl though, and it never fails to be divine. The limited space makes it very cozy, inside and out. Lots of people working, chatting, and kicking back in an old house. I have yet to try their other locations, but I am eager to! I'm a classic latte kinda girl though, and it never fails to be divine. They make their caramel in house so the caramel latte is especially delicious! The mocha is sinfully decadent. I haven't tasted a better one in town! And there is a lot of tasty coffee in this town.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Cute little coffee shop in Clarksville. I tried the vanilla latte and it was very refreshing. The service was fast and the baristas were very friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Nice little coffee shop that we hit on our way to the Longhorn Caverns. The latte was smooth and tasty. I would return here if in the area.  It doesn't compare to the coffees in San Francisco, but I haven't found anything that does yet. Sorry for the snobby SF comment, I can't help but compare.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Just another cute coffee shop tucked away in the heart of downtown Austin.  I came here on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating.  Unfortunately, there were not many pastries available.  I had a hot cup of tea and my brother had some decaf iced coffee, which he enjoyed.  Service was great.  Quiet spot to study.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"There are a lot of reasons to love, Austin, TX.  Great coffee & amazing people are some of them. Find them here at Caffe Medici in Clarksville.   Cheers to the kind staff and amazing java. The coffee is a touch expensive but that certainly isn't deterring fantastics - this place is buzzing all day until late afternoon.  Also. Thanks for the Cheese Danishes. Thank you.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Good cup of coffee (a bit pricey). Very nice vibe. Limited seating in close quarters, so other people's conversations were a butt distracting. Neat spot.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"10 check-ins I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, but I'll be nice and give it a full 5 stars. I would only dock .5 stars due to the limited space both in terms of parking and available tables inside.  I definitely prefer this location over that on Guadalupe. There are not as many UT students, which I prefer. I'm not a big fan of coffee shops filled with UT students who are ""studying."" The coffee itself is definitely one of the best I've had in Austin. It's tough to say which is the best when you have other coffee shops like Houndstooth and Patika. However, I always decide to come to Cafe Medici simply because it's the closest to where I live.  Like I said earlier, there's seating available but not nearly as much as those available at the Medici on Guadalupe. However, if you come at the right time, you should be able to find an open table.  If you're visiting Austin or looking for a new coffee shop to check out, I'd definitely recommend coming by this place because the coffee is just always on point.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Outside of Italy one of the best cappuccinos I've had. I haven't had any other drinks because it's so good so it's what I always get.,1
Coffee Shop 8,I tried their iced latte twice. They do make good iced caramel latte with soy milk. Their ice is small and perfect for the iced drink.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"I ordered a 12oz drip, 16oz Americano, and toasted bagel. The tab came to $9-and-change, which I thought was a bit high. However, I took a sip and both coffees were among the richest, most delicious I've ever had! You can really taste the beans. My wife preferred the Americano and thought the drip was too acidic, but I was a fan of both. It's truly coffee, not the ""coffee-flavored drink"" pawned off as coffee by many shops.  Parking is tight. There is free wifi and ample seating.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Good place and lots of room to study. My only complaint is I don't like the food options they have there very much. The coffee is good though.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"I spent Sunday morning on the porch of Caffé Medici getting to know a new friend and it was a lovely experience. The shop is in an old house. It really does a good job of making you feel like you're hanging out in a cozy living room surrounded by 15 of your closest study buddies. The front porch is a lovely addition; it's on a quiet street (or at least, Sunday mornings are quiet) but it's a nice break to hang out on the porch with a cup of coffee and watch the people stroll by.  The café uses Cuvee coffee. I wasn't familiar with that roasting company before coming to Austin, but it's everywhere around here! My cappuccino was good. A little too much milk for my personal taste, but still nowhere near the massive cups of milk with a shot that some companies try to pass off with that name (ahem, Starbucks). Ordering was easy to do and the baristas were very pleasant. All in all, it was another great coffee shop experience!",1
Coffee Shop 8,Whenever I'm in the mood for a high quality espresso drink I know I can come here and get one. Their equipment is top of the line and their coffee beans are excellent. The location in old enfield is such a great community spot and they do a great job of handling large lines quickly without compromising quality. Love the fact that it's dog friendly!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins I easily think that this Medici is the best location. It's easy to get to (as opposed to having to find street parking downtown or near campus), and has such a different feel than the others. Less students than the campus location, more residential locals, but all locations are pretty laidback.  This is the only location without two stories, but the pro of this one is the quaint seating on stone furniture in the front and the small patio space with a doggie bowl. The space is a repurposed home (well... you're in Austin) with great wifi, a great mixed crowd, closely spaced tables, and a feel of a friend's home or the neighborhood coffeeshop.  Even though this location has a lot, it's fairly small and often a time I've had to find parking elsewhere and walk over. This particular location is in a pretty hip part of that neighborhood, and there's always people biking by or walking their dogs outside. Oh yeah, the coffee is great too, and the baristas friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This is one of my favorite places to get an espresso in all of Austin! I haven't been to the new location on south lamar (right down the street from me), yet but I will soon. I LOVE the tiny spoons that they serve with the espresso, and of course the tiny biscotti that comes with it is delicious and I could eat ten million of them. Baristas are always friendly, I've never had to wait more then 2 minutes for a perfect espresso.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great coffee and very nice, happy staff!  Locally owned and cute neighborhood!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Cool spot...great Lattes...only one comfy seating area.  Most people looked like they were there to work on their laptops than visit with one another.  My friends and I enjoyed each others company, talking & laughing on the couch.  We will return.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Stopped by while in town for SXSW. Was concerned about some of the comments but in my constant quest for good coffee I decided not to be deterred.  Since it was breakfast time, I went with the cappuccino and a berry muffin. Both were delicious. The place was busy but had no troubles finding a place to sit. Yeah, they don't have the most comfortable furniture but I don't understand why some people think buying a cup of coffee gives you the right to sit there and work all day as if it was your office.  I would give this place 4.5 stars only since they don't offer pour over goodness. Cappuccino and berry muffin",1
Coffee Shop 8,"3 check-ins I cannot stop talking about the coffee here. Seriously, the best in town.  They make their own caramel syrup and every time I get a caramel latte and it's the best damn cup of coffee. Not too sweet like some places, just the right hint of caramel syrup, clean creamy coffee goodness. And they always put a pretty design on the foam.  These people know what they are doing and you cannot go wrong getting a cup of any type of coffee here. Plus, they carry Rockstar bagels and some really good other pastries and the like. EVERYONE I have ever met is awesome and friendly and I've had some really cool conversations while waiting for my coffee. Favorite coffee shop. Wish they had one up North by where I live.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great single origin coffee from many places, try a new one everytime you go. The servers are friendly and nice. One of the best things is the rotating display of photos ahd paintings by local Austin artists. This changes the decor all the time. The latte is probably one of the best in Austin. The ambient music is nice also. Outdoor seating is good but needs electrical outlets.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"The last three times I was in here.... I find the staff is less than satisfactory, being rude or simply appearing to not care. One cup of coffee was HORRIBLE.  I say go to the Guadalupe one.... This one is hostile to customers. maybe they just have too much buiness and so do not care if you are not on their daily list?",0
Coffee Shop 8,"This is our favorite coffee shop in Austin; and Lynn street is our favorite location. I'd give them 10^5 stars, but they don't do logarithmic functions here. They're just a coffee shop.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Love the hours at this location. Small seating area - cozy feeling. Has some outdoor seating. High turn over. Coffee was good. Had a latte - nothing spectacular but a well made. Free wifi and was able to get some work done. Nice spot for hanging out and catching up.,1
Coffee Shop 8,Cozy place with great coffee with cool foam designs. I would always go on Sunday nights and there would always be a few people there. Artwork always blows my mind. Some parking.,1
Coffee Shop 8,I usually go to the Caffé Medici on campus and what a difference! The service is infinitely faster than the other busy location and although smaller there is always seating! Really cozy feel. I loved it. Will probably be going back to this one exclusively.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"My husband and I decided to check out this place based on previous yelp reviews. We recently returned from Italy and it completely ruined us for drinking coffee out. I had high hopes for Caffe Medici because a friend had also told me she thought it was the best place in Austin.  The baristas did not disappoint. The place was packed and you could tell the orders were coming in as fast as those ladies could fill them, however, even being that swamped, they still took the time to make sure the quality of the drink was not compromised. In addition, they took the time to put some beautiful latte art on the drinks.  I ordered a cappuccino and my husband got a latte. I took my first sip and holy crap, it was strong and smooth! Yes! And just like that I found a little piece of Italy here in Austin, Texas. Thank you Caffee Medici. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Big fan of the coffee, spend way too much time and money there. Neighborhood spot, rarely do you go and not run into someone you know. Oh, and they have taco deli breakfast tacos too!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Mixed Bag at Caffe Medici - long time customer WON'T BE BACK.  First off, the coffee is DELICIOUS...but product isn't enough....    With tons of awesome coffee shops and roasters in town, it's gotta be more than just a nice cup of joe.    The thing that turned me from a fan to ""never going back"" the attitude from snarling barrister girl on my recent visit (probably my 20th this year).    Here's what happened:  When she was taking my order for a soy latte, (the same thing I order every time), she was on the phone and not paying much attention.  When she started making my drink I looked over and saw her using regular milk.  I gently waved at her to try to get her attention so she wouldn't have to redo the drink and she waved me off telling me she'd be with me in a second.  I waited and then she got off the phone.  I said, ""I'm sorry that's supposed to be soy...""  Her response, and this blew me away, ""You need to tell me that when you order...""  STUNNED... Really lady?    Wow, so not only were you not paying attention to me when I was ordering but then when I tried to correct you, you blew me off and THEN told me I needed to do something differently because you're incompetent?  Hmmm,..  THEN... it got nasty.  She takes the milk from the steel steamer and pours it back into the milk jug (TOTAL CROSS CONTAMINATION)  I watched, grossed out and wanting to simply leave in disgust.  So, as much as I like the yummy coffee I won't be back to this shop, I'm happy to vote with my dollars somewhere where I'm not treated this way and where it's safe to consume non-contaminated product.",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Coffee is really wonderful here.  I used to come here all the time in college because it's a nice quiet place to study, it feel like a small house.  It's located in a great neighborhood on West Lynn and right across the street from Galaxy and other great restaurants.  They have a decent size parking lot.  Inside is a bit small but you can manage to find some space, there is also outdoor seating.  The owners here are so friendly and nice.  The coffee is so fresh and perfect, it wakes you up instantly!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I will start out by saying, Cafe Medici makes great coffee... but there are many places in Austin that do. So what is the deal with the hipster attitude?  While ordering my cappacino, I specified that I'd like one Splenda. The hipster taking my order notified me that they don't carry Splenda... with contempt. As I'm staring at a cupful of Splenda packets on the counter behind him I say, ""what about those?"" His arrogant reply was, ""oh, I've never had anyone ask me for Splenda before"".  Seriously? Get over yourselves!",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Ordered the cold brew - decent.  In an old house, seems comfortable enough to hang out in.  Parking is somewhat difficult and it does get full.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"5 check-ins This place is awesome. I would rank it right up there with Intelligentsia in LA and Chicago, but Austin doesn't have an Intelligentsia so here is where I go.  Nestled into the quiet neighborhood on West Lynn in an old house, Caffe Medici is the embodiment of the perfect coffee shop.  Stop by, pick your ""poison"", and enjoy the great, free wifi while you browse quietly on the web.",1
Coffee Shop 8,What a drag it is getting old..... So I'm not a hipster. So I have grey in my hair. So what? Just because is that a reason for the snooty girl with long brown hair who shakes it almost dipping her strands into the coffee who filled my iced coffee up to the brim and I asked please a little space for milk she shrugs and grimaces in contempt. Is that a reason for me not to come here? Hmmmm. the coffee is superb but the hipster girl can take a walk for all I care.,0
Coffee Shop 8,"Not a bad place to grab some coffee, whether you're there to hang out awhile or on the go. Relaxed atmosphere, nice selection of coffee and other drinks and friendly service. Well worth a visit!",1
Coffee Shop 8,Caffe Medici is certainly a nice place to hangout. The seating outside is good and the location is great. I don't really see the need for five stars because the coffee is pretty average and the treats are a bit a lacking in variety. It would also be nice if they had some additional non-coffee options.  It's about what you would expect from a small neighborhood coffee shop. Would not hesitate to go if I was in the neighborhood but wouldn't go out of my way to get there.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"I am going to miss this place when I leave Austin. I've been to various cafes in Austin to do some work, but this is the perfect place. It has great ambience and is not one of those dark, dimly-lit, ibraryish ones. The only downside is that you may have a hard time finding a table during busy hours. I just wait for some time at the bar until a table becomes available.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Don't have enough good things to say about this place. Service, coffee options, ambiance were all impeccable! They make the BEST lattes and mochas in town!! Things to mention are they didn't have any food options and it was pretty quiet in there. Not a music-playing kinda coffee house. The parking sucks, but plenty of street parking around the area.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Updated review Listed in Keep Austin Caffeinated I wanted to write a funny review about Cafe Medici, but, unfortunately, there is nothing funny about espresso. This is serious espresso made by serious baristas.  You think I'm kidding? Well, you try drinking a bottle of wine after a long day in a cubicle. Then, have your young children wake you up at 6:30 a.m. Guess what? They don't care about hangovers. All they care about is chocolate milk and Iron Man.  It's not pretty, folks. Orange juice won't cut through the fog. English breakfast tea won't drive away that headache and give you a fighting chance.  Sure, you could pop into your neighborhood Starbucks and have some middling coffee made by people more interested in blasting out Caramel Mocha-Fattacinos and upselling freaking Via to keep the a-holes in Corporate off their backs.  Why not come out firing? Take your life back. Go to Cafe Medici, somehow park in that ludicrously small lot, and order some seriously good espresso made by someone who knows more about coffee than any sane person should.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Best coffee + vibes in Austin. Their treats are really classy too. Everyone there is nice and its usually pretty good for reading or hamming around with a friend. When its raining or cold, it can get crowded, since the outside seating is not an option.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great coffee, pricing comparable to other coffee shops. They were packed on the Saturday afternoon I was there, so it's not completely fair to evaluate the wait time I had for my coffee. I'll eat there and reevaluate later.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Don't know if it's like this all the time but for what I came to do today, Caffe Medici is hitting the spot.  Before I get down to the nitty-gritty, here's my frame of reference and some context: it's a Wednesday and I came with the intent to write on my laptop with minimal need for wifi. Time spent spanned late morning and early afternoon.  Great location - neither at a crossroads nor in no man's land.  Music is non-obtrusive (not too loud, no emo. Think pre-Jack Johnson Jack Johnson, Hawaii jam band without the jam, margaritaville without the margaritas...) Customers are self-contained and quiet.  Space - perfectly middle-of-the-road, nonextreme in size and neither empty nor overcrowded. There were several open spots when I got there, all readily accessible. I chose the last open two-top at the front and sat on the bench under the window, which provides seating for two other two-tops. Though both tables were occupied by patrons who also sat bench-side, there was still ample space for both me and my stuff to fit on the bench alongside them. To boot, where I sat at the end closest to the corner, I was able to plug in to charge without a hitch.  Staff is super nice. when I got here a little before noon, when they were about to get rid of the remaining breakfast tacos and they threw me two on the house. For this I'd give the place 6 stars if I could.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for caffeinated independent work, whether it be laptop or reading.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"So loud!! Do not come here to work or study. If you do, bring ear-buds. They're playing the most awful banjo, drum kicking, twang music I've ever heard, and on top of that, the two older men sitting next to me are gabbing about their past sexual experiences. Shoot me! I just came here to write a quick essay and test out the artsy, leaf designed lattes. I'd only recommend coming here to catch up with friends. I just might need therapy after what I heard the man to my left say he did in the 70's!!",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Parking is a problem but the damn good drinks are worth it.  I love the small house and the tucked away feeling you get when you sit in the corner.  The baristas are friendly, fast, and make a gorgoeus drink.  Bring your pup and sit on the front porch or bring a good book (you know, the paper that's bound and has words) and enjoy the upscale homey feel of the inside.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This place is definitely my favorite branch out of the three caffe medicis in Austin. I love how cozy it is and how it is in a semi-residential neighborhood. It's a great place to get some work done because it doesn't get too loud. There is a lot of foot traffic on the weekends and it's pretty hard to get a table so you have to stake out for a bit, but the coffee makes it all worth it. I always get their cappuccinos!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great atmosphere, fantastic coffee, Taco deli breakfast tacos, local pastries, good music.  I can't really say anything bad about Cafe Medici! Love this place.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Austin Awesome little neighborhood coffee shop that's frequented by the locals, including  a good coffee-drinking friend of mine.  I'm not a coffee drinker but I love the smell of coffee wafting throughout that shop.  You definitely gotta try their sausage rolls!  Just pure goodness! It goes great with a glass bottle of Coke.  Also, if you're in the mood for a breakfast taco or two, be sure to get there early in the morning cuz they sell out fast!  I definitely love the outdoor seating and tables made out of large rocks.  The staff were friendly.  Got to meet the owner and his family.  They're just an adorable family!  Want to feel belonged?  You'll definitely feel welcomed here!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Cool atmosphere in a cute/retro part of town. Good luck finding parking though. There are 3 (maybe 4 if you have a smart car) tiny parking spots behind the cafe. All other surrounding parking is associated with other businesses & brandishes towing signs, so just meander into the neighborhood. At least the houses there are fun to see.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Very nice place. Limited parking indeed (maybe 10 spots total), but it was worth finding parking on the street. The Cappuccino was delicious! excellent brew. The atmosphere was airy and plenty of natural light. There are small two-seater tables scattered, a couch with a bench, and some outside seating. Overall, a great shop.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Friendly coffee spot, great location and good coffee.  I've been on a quest to find a decent passable flat white in Austin. The folks at Caffe Medici knocked it out of the park.  Highly recommended.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Because I love coffee and everything about it, I've set out on an unofficial quest to try every coffee house in Austin and the surrounding area.  I finally tried Caffé Medici. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I'm kind of picky about my coffee and I am not easily influenced by what others say, however, my taste buds say this place really lives up to its reputation.  The lattes are smooth and bold at the same time - bold enough to grow hair on your chest if you get your coffee full on leaded. (I sometimes like to order de-caf....of the ""why bother"" variety).  If you don't want milk in your latte, they offer soy as an alternative. They swirl lovely art on top of the lattes for you. The lattes are prepared quickly. They also happen to offer pre-packaged gluten-free cookies in their pastry case, which I didn't try on this visit.  It's an old house. There are unique seats out front made of stone with wood planks drilled in. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is nice. You can find a bookshelf with books, magazines and games, or you can enjoy burying yourself in your laptop.....a little something for everyone it seems.  Cool place, great coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"While the coffee was decent, the ultra pretentious hipster vibe leads me to recommend other coffee shops over this one ....unless the ultra pretentious hipster vibe is your thing.  I made the mistake of (very politely) inquiring about almond milk to get a taste of the ultra pretentious hipster vibe in response. (no almond milk - just soy, in case anyone else is curious.)  I got the sense that it was a bit of a chore to give me my cup of decaf once the 4 minutes were up (side note: the coffee is all done via french press, which is cool).  The people visiting the coffee shop gave off a much less pretentious vibe than the ones working there - but that said, I still wouldn't return.",0
Coffee Shop 8,"The coffee here is insatiable. Two locations that I am aware of in Austin, but the West Lynn is my preference.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Updated review Got almond milk! Coffee is awesome and dp now taco deli.  Yummy.  My only gripe is parking.  Otherwise super cool and nice employees.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"I must be one of the few Austinites to truly dislike this place. We were eating at Galaxy Café when my brother-in-law mentioned that he heard how good Caffe Medici was. Since we were right there and already parked, we went over and got a drink.   Clearly, the folks behind the counter weren't people friendly and not super interested in working that day. Perhaps, it was us, a little to square for the hipster/hungover crowd?   I ordered the café latte, which turned out to be a horrible mistake. The bitterness of the coffee literally overtook me immediately. Now, I'm not sure whether to blame that on the coffee or the barista, but either way, it could have paved my driveway. Drink #1, epic fail. Since everyone else seem to be somewhat dealing with their coffee, and that's being kind at best, I decided to order an Italian soda, thinking surely, you can't mess up two drinks in one day. Epic fail #2.   Seating was a nightmare, so we didn't even bother.   Unless you just happen to be in that part of town and need a shot of caffeine, there are much better places in Austin. Parking isn't worth the hassle and the coffee isn't worth the $5+ you pay.",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Probably my favorite Medici location.  Smaller, cozier, and really laid back. Love the location in Clarksville, and I appreciate the ""neighborhood café"" feel that you get here.  The baristas are great about remembering your name and they're always really friendly. A lot of Austin baristas can be really pretentious and/or standoffish. Anywhere with amiable baristas is a breath of fresh air in the ATX specialty coffee scene.  Coffee is quality here, and that quality is consistent. Medici (all 3 locations) does an excellent job training their staff to deliver excellent espresso beverages over and over again. If you're looking for traditional espresso beverages, this is a great place to go. Some of the best in Austin!  It can get a little crowded here, and parking can be hard to find in the small lot. If the lot is full, be prepared to park across the road, or in the neighborhood just east of the shop. During busy times, you might have to wait for a table, or look outside. There are some great tables in front of the shop, but they are usually in direct sun, and can be unpleasant in the Texas heat.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Drinks good. Baristas chill. My only suggestion is that the wall decor is pretty sparse. For Westlynn, I'd expect more liberal use of the wall space...  It'd be nice to read/see a bit more of the history of the building or of the Medici business.  Yes, there is photography posted, but there is a lot of blank canvas space with the walls, why not use the space to tell me a story?  Just a thought--people clearly come for the coffee, but they'd come back for a connection, so why not create it whenever and wherever possible?",1
Coffee Shop 8,"After coming here a number of times, I figured it was time to finally review this place. Of the two Medici locations I've been to in Austin, I like this one the most. It's some sort of refurbished home in a small, residential area. They tend to be crowded inside but only because it is a small place. To counter that, they have neat stone chairs outside that are always available. I've never had a bad drink here and have never had any issue with the staff, though I also never order anything particularly fancy or difficult. Can't review the food since I've never eaten it.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This is definitely my favorite place in Austin to grab some coffee. Great atmosphere and superb coffee, perfect for quick business meetings and perhaps a first date :) I highly recommend it!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins The people working here are awesome.  They are super friendly and make you feel right at home.  I've been here twice and the atmosphere has felt lively and fun for a coffee shop.  They have Tacodeli breakfast tacos, which is a major + in my book.  The latte I got was good, but not amazing.  The coffee wasn't particularly unique or intriguing--not excellent or great, but good nonetheless.  The only real negative I have is that the parking is pretty limited.  You may have to park a ways down the street and walk over.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"My sister has evolved into a coffee aficionado.  I mean, she has spent many years in Austria, travelled and lived all throughout Europe and has this 900 dollar espresso machine at home that she and her husband make coffee from.  When she talks about drinking coffee, she uses a vocabulary that lets you know she has drunk a lot of coffee in her time.    Before she became so good at knowing great coffee, I brought her to Caffe Medici and she fell in love with it.  This was about 6-7 years ago.  Last year, after she was talking about more of her coffee drinking exploits, I asked her where Caffe Medici now ranks in her global experience of drinking coffee.  She said, ""Hmm, that's a tough question.  I think I still have to either put them at the top or at least the top 2-3 coffee shops I've ever been to.  My mom also likes to drink coffee.  She is this crotchedy ol' woman who can lose her temper quickly.  She visited my house from Florida one day and was upset when she woke up and realized I didn't have any coffee.  ""TAKE ME TO STARBUCKS!"", she bellowed out.  So, we loaded up in the car and headed out.    However, I wasn't taking her to Starbucks.  Since there is a Starbucks on every corner, she soon grew weary of our journey and so sweetly said, ""Where in the Hell are you taking me!"".  I told her that I was taking her to the best coffee shop in Austin to which she started ranting about leaving her alone and simply letting her drink the same Starbucks coffee she has drunk all these years.  ""What are you doing?  This is ridiculous! "", she continued on.    By the time we got in line to order (the Clarksville location), her demeanor reflected a mix of frustration at not getting her Starbucks as well as withdrawls from not having any coffee at all in her system.  She orders the Hunapu, straight black and we sat down so she could have a drink.  The last thing I remember her saying was,  ""I just wanted my Starbucks coffee and you bring me all the way down here to this house....Sip (Pause)...Oh damn, this is good"".  Mark",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Cuvee coffee wins - I like the roast at Once Over better but this is still damned good coffee.  Pluses: Medici has good coffee, a nice environment, and fast internet. Negatives: It's not closer to me, Once Over has a better Cuvee roast, and the stone blocks they claim are chairs outside hurt like hell after 15 minutes.  Conclusion?  Great coffee on the good side of town, but don't sit outside unless you brought your own seat cushion.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Italian sodas, great kitsch and sugarcane coca cola.  Folks here are really friendly  -- looks like its more of the working crowd and the casual conversations happen pretty organically from one table to another.    Great wifi, with adequate pluggage and a great use of the space.  I wish they had delicious diet coke but their coffee selection looked extensive and I think they've got the mix down right on non coffee to coffee drink ration.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Good location, close to downtown, chill area, french press coffee... homey house to study...",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Caffe Medici makes real coffee. Drip, french press, espresso (not ex-pres-o) etc....  I love the macchiato's. I'm not talking about Starbucks version either because that's a joke. This is as it should be, was made to be and is done correctly at Medici. Two shots, a small amount of milk and some foam. Quick fast in a hurry and out the door. That's how I do it at Medici. Mostly because there is no seating and everyone is camped out bumming the free wifi. Really? It's Clarksville I know you people can afford the internet.  Oh and watch your step here. What is it with people always spilling their water? I swear I've seen it happen more times that not at this location. I guess its the caffeine or lack there of jitters.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I have a fancy-assed very expensive Italian espresso machine at home with a fancy-assed burr grinder. I buy fancy-assed whole coffee beans, or sometimes roast them myself.  I rarely go out for coffee.  But if I have to, this is the only place I will go. The coffee tastes like real coffee, real espresso, real cappucinos... and by real I mean not some corporate-quality-controlled-likely with additives-starf*cks coffee. It's comparable to good coffee in San Francisco or Seattle.  If you've been afraid of real espresso for fear it will be bitter, sour or just unpalatable, try it here.  The parking can suck.I've never tried the food. They have water bowls for your doggies.  Some staff are nice; some seem to have Asperger's. I see complaints about lack of comfy chairs, but I go for the coffee, not the chairs (profound, huh?)  They will serve you in a real cup too. That's a weird statement, but I'm tired of getting paper/throw-away take out cups when I want to sit and linger with a good cup. I feel like I'm a McDonald's when I get served coffee in a paper cup.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure Cute little craftsman house, which adds to the ambiance.  Location is close to downtown but without the horrible parking issues... Just normal parking shortage, as is common for most trendy urban haunts. The espresso was a little bitter to me, but not burnt tasting. Day-old pastries  (from Quacks!!) are $1.   I put off coming here because every time I search for coffee an ad pops up, which seems to defeat the purpose of Yelp reviews & makes me wonder why they lean on advertising vs. word of mouth.  You can get real food, and they have all of the random not-cow milks.seems like a better place to meet a friend to chat than find a comfy spot to hang out.",1
Coffee Shop 8,I have never had a great experience here. It is overpriced and overly hipster. I have tried to study here before and the seats were like torture devices.,0
Coffee Shop 8,"came here on Tuesday around 2pm. We drank one cappuccino, one espresso  The good: The serves was amazing Drinks were even better cute inside  The bad: Its a small place Their was a stool left out front that was broken it looked bad and should have been just tossed out.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I had a latte that was one of the best I've ever had. I really want to go back for another one even though this place is nowhere near where I live, it was that good.  Unfortunately this place is fairly small and there just isn't much seating. While the barista made a fine, fine drink, he was a little detached. Maybe he wasn't awake enough? He wasn't rude or unfriendly, just kind of vacant.",1
Coffee Shop 30,from the website: 'Holy Grounds is located in the main building of St. David's Episcopal Church. You can park in our surface lot in front of the St. David's main doors.'  Some of the food comes from another St David's ministry/business: Café Divine stdave.org/about/on-camp… ( sign up for a weekly Thursday lunch menu email )  St David's is a way busy church and community hub all round! stdave.org,1
Coffee Shop 30,"First of all.. HOW CUTE IS THIS NAME FOR A COFFEE SHOP IN A CHURCH? I'm sorry.. we should just all take a second to appreciate it...  Okay, second over. Thank you!  I stopped by this place on the way back from a run in the morning. I had two things on my agenda - get some coffee and pick up a cute souvenir to bring back home.. this place had both! The gentleman who worked there was so nice and gave me recommendations on what I should bring home. Plus, the check-in offer let me get a free coffee with my purchase!  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for coffee or little trinkets/knick knacks to bring back.  (p.s. the employee told me the BBQ at the church is called ""Holy Smokes"" - I almost died laughing)",1
Coffee Shop 30,"Tucked away coffee shop and bookstore off the busy Main Street. Great find, friendly people, and wonderful coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 30,"What a wonderful, quaint experience inside St. David's Episcopal Church.  Of course the people are amazingly friendly, but oh the coffee!  Try the Mayan Mocha. It really is delicious.  I am happy to be working one block from here right now. Mayan Mocha at the cutest coffee shop. This mocha is amazing!",1
Coffee Shop 30,I was trying to find a coffee shop to relax and cool off and after little bit of getting lost I found it and it was worth it. Its inside the St David's Epyscipale Church  but the enterance is between 7th and 8th street mid block.   Super cute; quiet oasis with very drive fly staff and chill music. 3 comfy big chairs.  I also had the chickpeas salad that was yummy; the juices spilled on my shorts but that is another story. :) Great ambiance and music So so cute Chickpeas salad $4.25. Yummy,1
Coffee Shop 30,"This place is a little gem!  You just gotta check out out!  The Mexican blend brewed coffee is simply their best.  It's all pretty good actually,  even food!   Lots to buy in the store,  especially if you're spiritual.",1
Coffee Shop 30,I ordered a French Press coffee with a shot of espresso and was quite tasty. The locale itself was difficult to find. The quality of the coffee alone is worth 5 stars. They offer sweets and food. I liked the laid back ambiance. I love Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 30,"Overlooking the labyrinth at St. David's, this place had intrigued me as I left after attending a 5:00 service (ah, incense!). Holy Grounds is full of interesting gifts, mostly but not all Christian themed. Among the souvenirs I bought were jalapeño peanut brittle and some Austiniana, as well as notecards by the Art from the Street project. It's a great variety, yet the space seems perfect for meetings, as several groups were doing. Oh, and the coffee's good. This IS Austin, after all.",1
Coffee Shop 30,"Listed in More than 100 in 2015! So, a couple of things to start out with.  First, the location on the Yelp map was incorrect -- it sent me to South Congress St., which couldn't have been further from the actual location.  Secondly, you really have to dig into the reviews to see that it's actually inside the church (and not visible at all from the street). Kinda frustrating, but not their fault at all.  The cafe and little shop were really cute, with super affordable coffees (local, I believe), and breakfast treats. There was a bookstore, too, but I didn't have enough time to try it out.  It's a great little spot and much, MUCH cheaper (and better-tasting) than the Starbucks at the Hilton or the coffee stand inside the Convention Center. Definitely worth stopping by! I had the Starling roast, which was superb.",1
Coffee Shop 30,Delicious coffee and they have more food options than you would expect! Friendly service and the prices aren't half bad for a downtown coffee shop.,1
Coffee Shop 30,I love this place!  They have the best coffee & the best staff!  Everyone is really friendly. They even have specials/promotions.  You cant go wrong with their paninis!  and the soups are so yummy! They also have taco deli tacos every morning. Free coffee on Fridays! so many cool things about this place!,1
Coffee Shop 30,"Great place... Not religious, but place had a good  latte, was good...nice place  ...  Pleasant atmosphere...",1
Coffee Shop 30,"As a ""reg"", I gotta say that the Mayan mocha is a revelation. And the baristas are all pretty awesome.  This place is like a warm blanket for all of us who work in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 30,"Holy coffee! What a precious place to have nestled in the middle of downtown. I would never have stumbled upon this place if I didn't know it was there, and what a shame for the average wanderer! Holy Grounds has: amazing music, a wide selection of books to read and purchase while sipping coffee, Tacodeli tacos, cozy chairs to curl up in, and most exciting for me, a Labyrinth Meditation Garden!!!! Walk down the stairs outside the church and you'll find yourself in a beautiful ivy-covered terrace. Follow the winding brick pathway and you'll find yourself in a new state of mind, observant, tranquil, content. The baristas are so sweet, the coffee and food everything I could ask for and maybe the best part is that it is so hidden, a place undiscovered by many and therefore so much more appreciated by those lucky enough to get to stop in here.",1
Coffee Shop 30,"I love this place. I have stopped here twice for coffee on my way to work, and the people make my day brighter because they are so happy/friendly! I highly suggest just a plain latte. The coffee is delicious and they also have a gift shop with some cute items.  Note--this is inside of St. David's church. You enter on the north end of the church.  Also, they have a $5 card minimum, but you can also create an account and they charge your total purchases on the 1st of every month.",1
Coffee Shop 30,"I'm a visitor to Austin. Found this place on Yelp. 4 1/2 stars. Looks good. Went there for breakfast, wanted to try their breakfast taco.  I order it thinking its fresh made. But no, she reaches into a hot tray and pulls out this pre made ""thing"", wrapped in tinfoil. Most of the shell stuck to the tinfoil when I tried to open it. Will not return. The coffee was good. Fresh out of the thermos.",0
Coffee Shop 30,"23 check-ins First to Review Where can you drink fair trade coffee, eat Rockstar bagels and Kakawa chocolate covered cocoa beans, shop for hand blown glass with a low carbon footprint, browse Haitian wall art made from recycled oil drums, and pick up a copy of The Book of Common Prayer, too? If you replied: ""A south Austin hipster's apartment with a particularly random Anglican slant"", the judge's would say you were correct. But the answer we were looking for was ""Holy Grounds"", the coffee shop/bookstore located inside Austin's own St. David's Episcopal Church.  Whenever I have a conversation about the added perks that come with attending a downtown church, the fact that we have both Cafe Divine and Holy Grounds inevitably comes up. It's wonderful to have a built-in coffee shop for those times before or after service, or the days you find yourself at the church early during the week. Actually, it's where I say I'm ""going to go split a bagel with Jesus"".  It's also convenient to have an entire treasure trove of books to browse and purchase, especially if one will be used for a Journey Group, or a friend has recommended one for you to check out. As expected, many of the major Anglican/Episcopalian writers can be found, but among those with more general Christian topics and philosophy.  I think what people also need to know is that Holy Grounds is open to the public. This is definitely a new place to try if you work downtown in the area, as this may be a surprisingly close locale to grab some coffee or a snack. My personal favorite is a basic iced latte, but I am definitely interested in trying a Mayan Mocha, which they list as a customer favorite. Also, it's located in a church, so...you're kind of guaranteed friendly service from the baristas.  Speaking of service, in the recent past I had been scouring the entire city (including the Episcopal seminary) to try and find an Episcopal shield bumper sticker for my car. It costs less than a dollar, and to me should have been everywhere, but for some reason I couldn't find it online for the life of me, and I was told that the bookstore had stopped ordering this particular style. I left my name and number in case they ever came across one.  I had all but forgotten this request, when, months later, they received a shipment and someone called to tell me that my sticker was in. I couldn't believe it. Like I said, even *I* had forgotten about it, so it was remarkable they had remembered and had called me.  I'm notoriously unlucky with greeting cards, but Holy Grounds has a wide assortment to choose from by local artists Michael H. McKann and Ben Sargent. Naturally, it's easy to find cards for religious occasions such as baptisms, marriages, etc.  Along with Bibles and prayer books, this is the first place in town I've ever seen Anglican prayer beads for sale. Handmade by the Austin company ""Fiber Figments"", I have my eye on them, although I need to learn exactly how to pray them first before I actually purchase one.  In short: from breakfast tacos to quiche, candles to cards, Bibles to blown glass...Holy Grounds has it all.  Episcopalians with a passion for locally-sourced Austin goods? Now THAT's a real blessing!  5 Stars. Mayan Mocha",1
Coffee Shop 30,"Tricky to find, located in an active church.  As you enter there are friendly greeters at a concierge desk,  the Holy Ground is  on the left in the gift shop. Friendly, quaint and with an element of suprise. The coffee is good and fresh with a light breakfast menu. We had a dark roast and a light , both good.  The shopping is whimsical,  religious and cool!  I highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 30,"5 check-ins Always excellent service here!  From what I'm told, the coffee is superb.  I can vouch for the hot chocolate - it's very good, but almost too much chocolate.  The breakfast items include bagels, croissants, various pastries and breakfast tacos from Taco Deli (served hot!). Lunch special changes daily.  I'm impressed with this little gem in the St David's Episcopal Church!",1
Coffee Shop 30,"Great lunch spot! I had a turkey bacon panini - excellent flavor and just right on crispness. Also tried the basil lime drink. More bitter than I was expecting, but a terrific flavor combination and very refreshing. I thought it was a little expensive, but considering the quality of the food, it was a great value. I would eat here again.",1
Coffee Shop 30,"Two colleagues and I were in town for a conference and looking for a place to kill a few hours. Enticed by the Vietnamese coffee, we  decided to check it out. We encountered a comfortable coffee shop/book store with friendly staff and a nice environment to take a little break and get a little work done. We were the only people there for the majority of the time besides the church staff and community floating in and out to catch up and chat. I also really liked the novelty drinks (had a hard time deciding) and the music.",1

Coffee Shop 22,"Figure 8 is a wonderful spot to get your coffee. I tried a handful of Austin's coffee spots during my visit, and Figure 8 was my favorite.  I ordered cappuccinos both times, and both times they were perfection. It's in the details.  The interior is eclectic and comfy, the folks are friendly, and the east Austin location makes you wonder if you were dropped in Kansas by a tornado.    If only I lived in Austin and could come here every week... Bye bye yummy cup of goodness. We will meet again someday Exterior seating. I guess charming is the word here",1
Coffee Shop 22,"11 check-ins UGH. Okay I freaking love this place. I've been going here since it opened and my visits have slowed down significantly - the coffee has been meh the last few times.  I never used to get americanos (iced). I've never been a fan of the taste and end up overloading it with sugar. But Figure 8 has been the only place in the history of my life that can make an amazing americano and really capture the essence and notes of the roast - no anything else needed.  I'm so sad that it's just not as tasty...as the owners passed the torch to the baristas they've hired, I've just not really liked the coffee. I really really liked this place a lot...  This doesn't mean don't check it out. The vibe, the deco, and the ambience are hip, young, and refreshing. The lattes are still pretty amazing and I'm still a fan.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"4 check-ins Figure 8 is an easy walk away from my humble little abode.  It's always bustling and draws a pretty good cross section of people. The inside is spacious enough and has an ample amount of tables for you to sit at.  It's impeccably decorated and has a really great energy about it. While parking isn't one that lends itself to its own private lot----there's plenty of street parking a hop skip and a jump away.  The coffee is pretty decent! I haven't had a cup that's made me make any undue faces yet. And they manage to make cappuccino art when I order with almond milk....which is impressive. :)  The only downside is that the folks working the counter are so friendly...that sometimes they get caught up in conversations with everyone around them....that you can be left standing at the counter, ignored----consciously-----for a couple of minutes. If you're not easily perturbed by this, then it won't faze you. But if you expect decent customer service in Austin (really----at this point, why is this still an expectation of yours?)---then you just roll with it and bat your pretty eyelashes at one of them till they wrap up their conversation.  The bathrooms are really clean and I've seen a door with a sign on it that suggests it leads to a patio....this Alice in Wander-land has yet to cross over it to explore what's on the other side. Waiting for my white rabbit I suppose.",1
Coffee Shop 22,2 check-ins Really excellent coffee. A lovely space to work. Need I say more?,1
Coffee Shop 22,"This place was a welcome departure from my usual coffee haunts. I easily found (free!) street parking close by. The coffee was strong, cheap, and hot. There were plenty of outlets. The inside was well-lit, and there was lots of greenery, which I appreciate. Overall, it was a little crowded, but it's a great place to work.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"i really like spots like this. rolling through the east side and pass up a small café. parking sucks because its on the street. be patient. when you walk in the bar is there and you order. the menu is on the counter and is small. I looked online and couldn't find it, kinda frustrating. once you order there is plenty of seating for parties of 1 and 2. if you have a larger group you might have to wait to combine tables. we chose to sit outside in the back patio area. the door is straight back. when you open the door you think you are headed to the dumping area but walk along the fence and there are tables and chairs back there. not used much but its an option. we got bugged by flys and mosquitos :( pricing was ok",1
Coffee Shop 22,4 check-ins Love it!! Lots of seating and outlets. Great coffee and place to work. It is in a cute area and has a cool vibe to it. Highly recommend. See all photos from Julia L. for Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors,1
Coffee Shop 22,"Updated review 6 check-ins I think Figure 8 grew on me a lot recently! The baristas are super friendly and even bring your coffee right to your table which really made a good impression on me. I love how calm and serene it feels to be there with the multitude of plants and seating, and it is the perfect spot to work remote, free from distractions and plenty of outlets for charging up your gadgets. Their espresso drinks are also extremely satisfying.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"If I lived in Austin, this would be my go to for a neighborhood coffeeshop. It's locally run, great coffee beans, kind and knowledgable staff, inviting and cute interior and also has a patio. I was really glad a friend took me here and I wouldn't definintely come back next time I'm in Austin.  Thank you!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I love all the natural light in this place and the plants. There are plants everywhere. It made me so happy. I have green thumb envy with their fiddle leaf fig trees..... I have two myself, but theirs are just vibrant and growing all over the place. I love it. I love the atmosphere, the coffee is great and it's just so chill. Plus my iced coffee came in a mason jar. Yep, you got me. I'm smitten and will be back next time I'm in Austin. These two goofs and my mason jar coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Massively superior espresso.  (which puts it far ahead of most of the famous coffee places in North Central Austin.  East Austin is leading the way!)  Great workspace, tables and crowd.  No fancy food.  Just excellent coffee and work.  I love it.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I liked this coffee shop on the gentrified east side of Austin. Staff was polite and the coffee really tasted good. With tax, coffee came to $2.50 for a small size, to go. Glad I came in.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I can sum up the bad things about this joint in one word, parking. Other than the complete joke that 3 parking spots would be enough to handle the traffic this spot sees in a day, this place can do no wrong. Not only is the lighting ample enough to brighten the gloomiest of Monday mornings, the staff, coffee and location exceed all expectations.  Many people go to coffee shops to work remotely and this is a great place for it. It never gets too loud and there are a ton of outlets to keep the apples juiced up. They could use more seating, because it does tend to get packed, but if you're there on off hours you can secure a seat no problem.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"GET THE CORTADO.  Perfect spot for a meet-up or for studying/working.  Such great, friendly staff.  This place has a true ""Austin"" vibe, with great music, cool decor, great local and SF/Portland beans.  Definitely one of my fave spots in town.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Pros: -Located in eccentric East Austin right off of Chicon and 11 street, this quaint coffee shop offers an excellent cup of joe -soy latte: yum! -ok wifi speed....It's hard to come by coffee shops with speedy wifi -nicely decorated interior, simple yet stylish -patio seating in the front and the back -servers are very friendly- one even replaced my friend's coffee for free when it slid off the patio table- SPLAT! ""It sucks when that happens!"" He said.  Cons: -Only three parking spots, thus street parking is necessary. I've never had trouble finding a spot. -closes at 7pm",1
Coffee Shop 22,Very cute shop. Excellent decaf mocha!,1
Coffee Shop 22,"Listed in Did someone say coffee?, Best cafes to study at The fifth star was added for their super hip interior.  This coffee shop is what I perceive as the epitome of Austin; come here and you'll see. I loved the interior. The design. The color. The lighting. The space. I love this place.  My latte was better than most that I've had, and the time was productive and relaxing. I'd be back any time if my wallet is as rich and as deep as the espresso drinks..",1
Coffee Shop 22,"2 check-ins Lmao - I think I've found the most hipster coffee shop in Austin. It's a clean, aesthetically pleasing space that's well lit with natural light and has plenty of tables. I'm a fan! Parking wasn't too hard to find in the neighborhood right outside either.  The espresso is spot on! Although I did order an iced vanilla latte and mine came out hot, not iced (knocked off a star). But NBD, I'm sure they would have done something about it if I bothered to bring it up. The menu is printed on a small card by the cash register, so be prepared to make a quick decision when your turn is up!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Listed in Coffee Shops Saturday, 3:00 PM.  Quickie: ++ Drink quality + Friendly staff + Hygiene + Turnaround + Spacious + Low key vibe  And then...? Strong coffee game. I hope Figure 8 takes over Austin!  ********** Got my drank on:  1. Iced latte with honey     + Strong roast, slightly sweetened with bee's magic.  Constructive comment: *Option to compost?",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Great staff, cool vibe, delicious espresso. There is ample room for seating inside with 3 two seat tables outside front. They have a door inside labeled ""Patio"", but I didn't check or ask to see if there was additional outside seating in back. Parking in the area is a piece of cake too.  Their espresso seems to change regularly. They had two options the day I came, a blend and an Ethiopian one. The flavor profiles noted in the Ethiopian one sounded more exciting so I went with that one and was glad I did. It was super smooth and flavorful. I actually tasted blueberry in it which I was not expecting and it was kinda cool. It was a great pour too courtesy of Zach. Big fan of this coffee shop and I'll definitely be back. See all photos from Darren B. for Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors",1
Coffee Shop 22,"10 check-ins I absolutely love this place. Probably my favorite coffee shop in town. Here's why:  They have great coffee and nice, knowledgable baristas making it. I always get great amounts of detail on notes and body when I ask about what their different espresso selections are like.  Also, the atmosphere is great. I love all of the plants inside and out and the decor is very nice, yet feels perfect for an old house in east Austin. This place is one of my favorite Saturday morning activities!",1
Coffee Shop 22,Great little neighborhood coffee joint.  They brew Coava coffee out of PDX.  Seriously delicious coffee!  Service is great and the baristas know their stuff!  Highly recommend.   Cute little patio in back if you drink jo with your dog! Great coffee! Great little place if you drink coffee with your dog!,1
Coffee Shop 22,"Best latte of my life. I made my friend taste it, and the barista saw me and thought there was something wrong with it...but there was something so, so right with it. Creamy with a full roasted flavor and no acidity in sight. I would have one every day if I lived in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Good coffee, good internet, good tables for working remotely, and the baristas are great with computers if you have any technical problems :) not too many outlets, so stake out your table carefully if you've got a laptop. Coffee bar Succulents and coffee",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I am in love, love, love! You go, Austin! This place has a true ""Austin"" vibe, with friendly and 'easy' service, cool decor, great local (TX) and SF/Portland beans, a few friends hanging out around the counter and chatting with barista - it's like you walked into someone's living room during a study-party and getting a super delish cup of coffee.   I had a cap with local of local beans - a new discovery - Tweed Coffee Roasters. There were a lot of people on their laptops - looks like a lot of students frequent this place.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Excellent pastries, great coffee, true coffee house feel. Definitely worth coming to even if it's off the beaten path for tourists.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Cold brew served in a mason jar by a friendly barista? Yes, please!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"A solid, laid-back spot for enjoying your coffee with a book! Located in a small neighborhood in East Austin, it offers a perfect place if you want to run away from all the city madness. The coffee was just perfect (both hot and cold), and for my iced coffee I was able to pour the almond milk myself, love it! Very friendly staff, this place is not pretentious at all. Will come back again!",1
Coffee Shop 22,Coffee was really bitter.  Would have been a nice place to settle in and get some work done but I had to leave after the first cup.,0
Coffee Shop 22,"Listed in a latte love Wow, I love this place!  Super cute, great ambience, not too noisy or too quiet, perfect atmosphere to hang out with friends or just study by yourself. Their interior design is really inviting and warm and with lots of sunlight---wayyy different than something like Epoch or Bennu's, which is usually darker, and more bright like Thunderbird's. Also, it wasn't even that busy on a Saturday afternoon though I think there was a small rush around 4 pm--but I definitely found myself an empty table. Not sure if they're super well-known yet, which might be why, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it super crowded in a few months (the way Thunderbird's is). There aren't many outlets, so I guess that might be the trickier thing.  Parking wasn't terrible--it is street parking, but I found quite a number of empty spots across the street and down the neighborhood. So it is doable.  The baristas were both really friendly though I didn't partake in any conversation with them. They went out of their way to hand me my coffee at the table and pick it up when I was done, which usually almost never occurs at other coffee shops.  Their coffee was GREAT. I got a vanilla latte, and it was so on point, haha. It was very rich and smooth, not overwhelmed with milk but still quite creamy and foamy. When I was ready to leave, I almost thought about buying another one to go--it was that good. A little on the pricier side--I've had some good coffee/lattes for less than what they charged, so that might be the only downside.  STILL--Figure 8 is a great coffee spot, one of the best I've been to in Austin. vanilla latte",1
Coffee Shop 22,Absolutely the WORST espresso ever. Both blends were vile. What is up with the preference for acidic and bitter overtones at these boutique coffee houses?! Cool place and good service at least.,0
Coffee Shop 22,"Love stopping by here whenever I'm in town. Whether I'm just grabbing a coffee to-go or trying to get work done, this is the spot.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Easily one of the best coffeeshops in the city, and I say that with no hyperbole. ... beautifully laid out and designed interior. white walls, dark brown wood benches and tables with ample space to work. Excellent and quick service (servers bring you your order and clean up after you're done). Lots of big windows to let the light in that just gives the place this really relaxing and airy feel.  Clean bathroom, lots of parking, nice and quiet so you can put your head down and get some work done or you can just have a nice quiet conversation with a friend or a date if you're so inclined.  Definitely a 5 star joint, but they just changed their ISP provider to time warner and the wifi complete crap now. they also close a bit early (7pm everyday)  Hopefully they fix that, if so I'll amend this review accordingly.  PS: They fixed the wifi somewhat ... its not terrible, but its not super great either, just keep that in mind.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"5 check-ins ROTD My new favorite coffee spot in Austin! I love the way they decorated the place: the mirrors...one which is supposedly haunted, the industrial look, even the light fixtures. The owners Ryan and Kathleen are super nice and make some mean coffee.  Their Iced Vanilla Latte has this nutty taste which I like. The price is reasonable too. My friend got the regular Vanilla Latte and said the coffee art was the prettiest she's ever seen at any coffee shop. =]  There's plenty of street parking on Chicon St. I've so far been able to find seating in the shop, but I predict this place will become very popular soon. But that won't stop me from coming! Friend's picture of the Vanilla Latte",1
Coffee Shop 22,"2 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost Lovely shop. I came back in August '14 when they had recently opened, and I wasn't a huge fan then. I am now.  They have a wonderful selection of coffees - Four Barrel & Tweed - and Figure 8's one of the only spots in Austin where you can get a fantastic pour over. Not many shops in Austin will run this..Cuveé and Houndstooth are among the few. (I've been to many places in Austin, but not all.)  Anyway, they opened up a great side room that's a little quieter and away from the bulk of the crowd that comes in. Parking is easy. Wifi and pastries. Folks here know what they're doing - very friendly and attentive.  Check it out.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Located on top of a hill in a quieter part of town, right by Huston Tillotson University.  Friendly staff! I actually thought I might've left my wallet at home and the barista offered that I could pay them back on my next visit. Luckily I found my wallet, but it was considerate of her to offer.  Great tunes. Some slightly-grunge indie rock.  The place was clean, neat, with some nice plants around. Overall, the atmosphere was calm. The bathroom could use a touch-up, but no big deal.  I had a cappuccino, it was delightful. I went on a sunny afternoon, I hope you do too!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I don't really have any ideas, but if I were ever going to try to write the next great American novel, I think I could write all of it at Figure 8 Coffee. The vibe is ideal. Their playlists take me out of the daily grind of my life. There are healthy plants. Natural light. Nice staff. People reading and working on laptops. No riff-raff.  The coffee is really superb too. I tried a latte last time I was there and I was pleased.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I came here to work and they have an area in the back that's a lot quieter than the front area. The place is clean and neat the bathroom was a little musky for some reason and very dark. The coffee was pretty good (I'm not a coffee guy) and they had this salty oatmeal raisin cookie. That was really good, I shared it with the baristas.  Pretty hipster in here. The tables are made of metal and wood. They don't have too many outlets, and finally, the wifi is fast and reliable.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"This is place is a perfect example the absurd overpriced bougieness of the new east side. I could get a meal for the price of their green tea. Yes, the decor is nice, and yes, the baristas are hip and attractive... but if you were to show the menu to someone who lives 5 blocks north of here, they would spit-up their $1 coffee. I'm all for nice things! Go ahead and sell your overpriced coffee style du jour... but the fact that you literally can't buy a single thing that is simple and affordable just makes it seem like they are trying to rub the gentrification right in their neighbors' faces. This aluminum-infused tortilla with a sprinkle of eggs is what they call a ""breakfast taco"" ... guess how much they charge for it?",0
Coffee Shop 22,"Great coffee place! It's just great to have a drink and be able to relx, music is fantastic and it's just a great place to sit and enjoy some coffee",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Not a fan. The coffee was good, but certainly not great.  Perhaps I would've given them another star, had their barista not practically argued with me on how I wanted my espresso drink & why he felt he knew better than my personal preference.   A customer knows what they want, so making them feel like you're talking down to them, is not going to change their mind regardless.  Also, they need to clean up their restroom...it was not very clean.  I for one, will not be coming back nor referring them.  Looks like they have enough people liking them, so this review will be no skin off of them.  Just so you all know...if you travel a bit further, you'll find much better coffee places.",0
Coffee Shop 22,"Strongest coffee this side of the Rockies, and a committed, sincere establishment to boot, Figure 8 does the trick when it comes to great coffee. I was very impressed with the barista's command of coffee blend bean details, and their Americano gave me a jolt that might have registered on a Richter scale.  Place is in a funky part of town too--maybe Austin's equivalent of the Lower East Side. Slightly out of the way but highly recommended.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Went there this morning at the end of a bike ride.  Coffee, breakfast tacos, pastries.  My Cortado and chocolate-chip muffin were both good.  Twenty-somethings crowd, much from around the neighborhood I think.  Friendly baristas.    I'll visit this again.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I Love this place.  I go here when I really want to buckle down and tackle my ridiculous med books.  Their bathroom is great, the patio is always empty, so it's nice and they utilize the space inside nicely to fit as many customers without feeling too crowded.  The only thing deterring me from giving my favorite coffee place in Austin 5 stars is the fact that the coffee prices are waaay jacked up.  I'm sure I spend more than I should here, but nonetheless the owners are sweet and I support them.  Plus the music is usually unique with a wide variety and the location is away from the hustle and bustle of traffic.  I don't mind that it's on Chicon lol.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Updated review Still my favorite coffee shop!  Figure 8 is a bright spot in a sea of ""cooler than you"" coffee shops that seem to be popping up everywhere.  If you're not drinking coffee here, you're missing out.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Awesome baristas, attention to detail in both espresso based drinks and pour over.  Plenty of seating, especially with the back patio area.  A few ex-Houndstooth people here and they cycle through some of the same roasters including Tweed but they recently featured guest bars from Coava and Four Barrel so that was cool.  Parking here sucks balls so I rarely go based on that alone.  If you live in the neighborhood you are lucky.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I was in Austin for work. My coworker had a crush on the gal behind the counter. So, we went to Figure 8 frequently. ;)  Coffee, fantastic. Ambiance, fantastic and peaceful and industrial and bright and rustic. Backyard area has so much potential! Throw some succulents and fairy lights up! Bam, outdoor Austin coffee shop vibes.  No, seriously though, great place. Good coffee. Cool people. But isn't that Austin in general?",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Had a fantastic iced coffee, perfect for the heat of Austin's summer afternoon. The flavors were balanced enough to drink the coffee black. The atmosphere was well lit and open to light conversation or getting work done. Would definitely recommend if one were to find themselves in East Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"16 check-ins Friendly baristas, cool vibe, and great coffee!! Free (and stable) wifi + many outlets= good place for bringing your laptops  When I visited there, they have beans from Coava and Four Barrels. As I becoming a coffee snob recently, I crave for beans from good roasting companies that you can hardly find in Austin. Cortado They have beans from Coava and Four Barrels from time to time. One bag is ~$15.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Okay, first off I am a coffee maniac. I brew my own french press cup one at a time at home and hand grind each blend of up to four kinds of whole beans. I have the coffee tasters flavor wheel poster up in my kitchen. So, on our Saturday outing, my girl wants to go out for coffee, of course. And she takes me to Figure 8. It is simple, crisply decorated and cozy, well thought out in a calm unpretentious way. I get a cup of their pour-over, which is done by the cup and by hand personally. It does not turn out to be the perfect cup, but that is not the important part. I decide 3/4 through the cup, with some light encouragement, to go and ask the staff about their brew process. I am my usual polite but very direct self. Instead of eye rolling and huffy hipster agitation at my gall and total lack of coolness, the gentelman at the bar pleasantly engages me in a brisk talk on the nuances of high end coffee brewing, and after a few min of chatter, Identifies correctly what my issue may be in the flavor profile of what I got, and asks if he can make me a different brew. He presides over the pour himself, and when it arrives it is EXACTLY the kind of coffee that I prefer and enjoy. This is not a very likely outcome, at all, The coffee has notes of ginger, citrus, molasses and malt, (I took notes) and a round, warm character totally unlike the sharp leading note of the first cup. I told him that he 'nailed it dude' and left him with a hand written formula for my 'secret' blend I have developed over the last couple years of brewing and tasting.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I love seeing Fourbarrel in Austin! Such lovely, friendly baristas, real community feel (even during SXSW), bright and juicy shots of espresso, multi roaster but all radical! Try a cortado or a pour over, friends and family the hang is happening, another espresso please! (coffee love coffee @menottis)",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I realize I'm really selfish but I don't want to let everyone know about this place, so I'm keeping this review short. Favorite coffee shop in Austin so far. Fabulous cappuccino; lovely, light atmosphere.  It's very neighborhood-y. I've never seen such a consistently trendy population around Austin than the steady stream of locals pouring in here throughout the morning. Where do they come from?!? I did not fit in, but felt welcome regardless.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"So I'm in Figure 8 pretty much every day. If I'm not studying here, I'm passing through to get a coffee before heading to school.  1. The coffee is excellent. They cycle their espresso every few days, and if you ask the baristas which one you should get, they'll help you to figure that out. One is usually a more tangy espresso, while the other is less acidic.  2. This is a really chill place to study. They're always playing good music, the people that come here are great and most people are here to either read or do work. The only slight downside is that sometimes it gets hot inside and the AC doesn't quite overcome the heat, but that's when it's 95+ outside, and that isn't Figure 8's fault, it's just that Texas weather.  3. The baristas are all awesome. None of them have an edge or are snobby in the slightest (as can happen in some coffee shops). They're always chatting with customers and genuinely want to help out if you have any questions.  I've tried almost every coffee place in Austin, and this has now become my place to go.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"The coffee is very good here, been here twice.  The parking is tricky and the tables have been full every time I've gone with basically one or two people spread out at each one but the pastries and coffee are worth the stop!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Delicious, balanced cappuccino. Beautiful indoor space and cute outdoor patio as well. Pour over was tasty also! Four Barrel and Tweed beans available. Loved the repurposed production line glass table! Cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 22,"This place was amazing. Really liked the space, there is more room in there than it appears from the outside. Staff were very friendly. Coffee was absolutely amazing. Really enjoyed the latte they made for me. I went to get some reading done and it worked out for that. Great coffee spot.",1
Coffee Shop 22,I love this scrappy little coffee shop. They will remember your name and how you like your drink. There's a DJ on Sunday mornings (alternating weeks) and the coffee is really great. My usual is an Americano and it is always prepared perfectly.,1
Coffee Shop 22,"The decor at Super 8 is more modern than most of our other Ausrin coffee haunts. It is tastefully done and I enjoyed sitting bar and enjoying the natural light that shines in the big windows. The coffee is delicious and arrives to you looking more like art. The gentlemen who work here are super welcoming and Zac is extremely well versed in the art of coffee and will take the time to answer any questions you may have. The team really seems to enjoy their work. Nice little spot, nice people. Coffee = Art A masterful Cortado! See all photos from Sheila F. for Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors",1
Coffee Shop 22,"4 check-ins YES! Brilliant little coffeeshop.  This is a great place to have a cup of coffee, do some work, and read a book. I am so glad Kathleen and her husband took over this space after it was empty for a while and made it ""theirs."" They have done a good job bringing out their own style and it is the perfect addition to the Chicon area. A neighborhood coffeeshop at its best.  The highlights: -Cup of quality coffee for $2 -Nice plants around -Plenty of seating; I like the ""mirror wall"" because it makes the shop feel bigger -Good sunlight streaming in -The internet works and works great -Sweet owners...so important ;)  I think this is the first review I've written where I truly think to myself, ""Gosh, I hope nobody actually reads this so I can keep this beautiful place to myself."" But alas, Figure 8 should be given their due compliments.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Been here twice in two days. Nice space, but they shouldn't sell products that they don't know how to make. Yesterday's Americano was bitter, burnt, and watery, while today's Cortado was just plain awful. A Cortado shouldn't be bitter, nor should it be lukewarm, especially at nearly $4.  Yet another coffee joint trying way too hard to be something it doesn't know how to be. Stop with all the single source and cold brew silliness and learn to make a good coffee first THEN maybe add the more pretentious stuff, no?  Oh well, it's on my way to work, and they play nice music. That is a plus...",0
Coffee Shop 22,"First to Review Listed in Great Austin Coffee Houses Kathleen and Ryan have opened up a gorgeous neighborhood coffee shop on the East side that will surely become a destination for coffee lovers alike.    It's currently roasting a coffee called Tweed which comes from the Houndstooth coffee family but the cool thing about Figure 8 is a plan to continuously rotate beans from all over the US.  I'm looking forward to checking out the various offerings in the coming weeks and months.    If you need a snack they offer pastries from Quack's and The Steeping Room.  They also serve Steeping Room tea if you prefer that over coffee.    Parking is street parking.  There isn't much of anything to walk to close by for now but in the coming years I'm sure that will change. You can easily bike to cool east side spots like Salt and Time, Whistler's and Hillside Pharmacy from here.  Figure 8 is still in a soft opening phase so things will evolve over time.  They don't have a website or phone number yet (just a Facebook page) but if you want to check them out they are open 7 days a week from 7AM-7PM. See all photos from Heather F. for Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Listed in Get your (coffee) grind on. The ambiance is clean. White walls, wood and metal chairs and tables. Lots of plants. Big windows, big mirrors.  There is a front room where they make coffee, play music, and people can chat. There is a smaller back room that is relatively quiet because people who came alone sit here with headphones on and don't talk much.  Had a great vanilla latte and banana bread! :)",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Small, intimate coffee house which the owners care about the process of coffee/espresso. I usually drink just coffee and none of the fancy stuff. The pastries were good. I sat at the bar while working on my assignment for class. There's a mirror wall, a table with a plant divider, good coffee and free WiFi. It's only been opened for two months.  Just a few notes - not many outlets and parking can be tricky. Too bad they can't be opened late though but I like Figure 8 and definitely a place to try out when you are in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 22,Breve today was spot on...lovely flavor and a bit of art. I'm from out of town but all was great based on my short visit. Would definitely return.,1
Coffee Shop 22,Good coffee and a pretty cool place to lounge at.  Parking is limited but not impossible.,1
Coffee Shop 22,Great smooth espresso. Pour over was light and flavorful too. Definitely a worthy visit if you are in the area and need a caffeine fix.,1
Coffee Shop 22,"Really good experience today as it was our first time here.  The coffee was as it is supposed to be:  strong!  They have different varieties of coffee and although the cups are smaller than your regular mainstream coffee places, the price/quality ratio is really good. The ambiance was good and even though parking can be a bit difficult it is worth it! The one thing that is that the barista lady seem a bit distracted... Coffee is a serious business, so no room for distractions! ;) Overall, really good!!!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I've had dozens of cortados since they started popping up around Dallas coffee shops in the last few years. I love them...and Dallas has an increasingly large number of higher quality, third wave coffee shops (Davis St Espresso, Ascension, etc.). But Figure 8's cortado seemed like an instant winner for my own personal 'Best Cortado of All Time' award.  Many times they have a bitter aftertaste, but Figure 8's managed to be incredibly smooth (so damn smooth) yet strong and robust.  Also, a very unique, understated decor and atmosphere. I told the Barista (Chris?) it was the best cortado, and he was gracious and friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"An awesome neighborhood jewel. The best 8oz latte, creamy and beautiful. The atmosphere is quiet and comfortable.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I think this is the best coffee in town.  Constantly rotating coffee selections and I've yet to find one I didn't like.  Staff are awesome and the shop has s great vibe.  Any day started here, is a day off on the right foot.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I must admit that I was swept up by the whole scene - the effortlessly cool whitewashed walls. Beautiful aloof plant placement, white tiles, wood counters, a hint of throwback glint. I mean, my cool quotient shot up just sitting there.  Lots of seating for people working or just meeting. Some outdoor seating out front too. Very interesting converted house feel in an offbeat part of town.  We got the cold brew and it was delightful, strong and perfect for an 80 degree spring day. I wanted to go back again the next day. Nay, I wanted to move in. But I will have to wait for my next trip back to Austin.  ps. this is the perfect place to escape SXSW madness.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"great coffee, visually appealing exterior and interior. I could sit here all day with a drink and the internet.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"2 check-ins Listed in Favorite Coffee in Austin Figure 8 makes some of the best coffee bevs in town, hands down. I ordered an Americano, and it was the best one I've ever had. Their drinks are made w/ precision, care and passion, and it's obvious by the quality of their output.  The space is small but comfortable, and they're in the process of putting in an addition for more space, so that's cool.  I will absolutely be back. And I especially appreciated how non-douchey this place was about coffee. That's rare in this town. Thanks, guys.  Note: Parking kind of sucks here, but not a huge deal.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Best coffee in Austin. Hands down. They close early, but I have to admit that keeps it from becoming Bennu, if you know what I mean. No offense to Bennu; I go there all the time to get work done. But I come to Figure 8 to get a great cup of coffee that I don't need to add shit to in order to make it drinkable.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"This place is as good as it gets. I couldn't have imagined a better coffee shop if I tried. Staff is top notch. They rotate through great coffee. Have breakfast tacos on the weekend mornings. I've only been on weekends and the place is always packed. But if you can get a table, it is the perfect place to study.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"15 check-ins For some reason, After my morning run I'm infected with this ""gotta have that sugar"" craving! That only a Soft chocolate chip cookie & a coffee can satisfy. This is my go to place hands down. The atmosphere is relaxing and the layout really helps me get work done. (After my indulgence of course) The baristas are pretty friendly & it kinda has a neighborhood coffee shop feel to it. Lots of space to sit especially with the new space that was added. Downside is they close @ 7pm, but I've stayed till 8ish while they clean up..without them giving a negative attitude.  - I want to end with the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger ""I'll be back""",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Great espresso, good rotation of beans. Best mocha I've ever had. Can't recommend enough!  Also, the iced chai was really good.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I needed a cup of coffee to go. Walk in and order a XL to go. Turns out the only have one size a 10oz. which is $2.50. I guess it was that much because they use 2X as much coffee as they should, as it was way too strong. It did have the hipster vib going for it, to go along with the classical music",0
Coffee Shop 22,"Our airbnb host recommended Figure 8 on her list of recommendations that were within walking proximity to our airbnb. I got my coffee fix here every morning and loved the coffee, the space and the people. By the third day, they already knew my order. I loved that they carried Four Barrel and made a great recommendation for a local roaster that I could take back to LA. I would recommend checking out Figure 8 if you're around east side Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Listed in Organic In Austin I really liked Figure 8's hipster vibe.  They serve organic milk which not many cafes in Austin do, and I really appreciated that.  The staff was very friendly and attentive and the pumpkin bread was very good, tasted like it was made that day. Lovely capo with organic milk.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Austin isn't short of quality coffee shops. So what makes Figure 8 5-star worthy?  Delicious coffee. I had an iced latte, and it was excellent. The espresso was rich, smooth, flavorful, and not sour. It's all I've had so far, but it already rivals some of the best I've tried in Austin. Apparently they roast Houndstooth's Tweed coffee roasters, as well as rotating other local roasters. I don't claim to be a coffee expert, but I can tell you Tweed just tastes good.  Inviting atmosphere. The shop is small, but not tiny. The feel is unique - think ""Happy Industrial Garden."" Similar to a happier, younger sibling of Wright Bros. Brew & Brew. Metal chairs and stools surround rugged wooden tables. White-painted brick meets exposed, painted rafters, concrete floors, and vintage light fixtures. The vibe is bright and cheerful, designed to invite natural light that complements the large mirror wall and ample greenery (a really nice touch). Two vintage Sony speakers flank an antique mirror above the coffee bar. Figure 8 has a happy interior, and I much prefer that to dark-and-cave-like (especially during the day).  Friendly staff. Ryan and Kathleen are kind, inviting, cheerful, chill, and knowledgable. They know their stuff, but there isn't an ounce of presumption in their work. They're the kind of people that make you happy to buy their product, and then come back again.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Pretty ambience and really good iced chai. Was sad they didn't really have cookies or anything though, but it's a really cute relaxing spot with good jams :)",1
Coffee Shop 22,"I love this place. The baristas are pleasant, the coffee is excellent, the space itself is so cute!  Their iced toddy is great. It's one of my go-to drinks to get me through the day. Their espresso beverages are perfectly executed, from milk texture and temperature to beautiful pours. This place as made me a believer in Tweed. They also have a lovely pastry selection that includes vegan options!  I love the ambience and light the room gets in the early mornings. It's such a romantic shop. I typically don't use coffee shops as an office/workspace and really enjoy just having coffee and a good conversation. Parking is limited, but I've always been lucky enough to find a spot very near the shop! A great local shop I am very happy to support.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Lovely service, quiet neighborhood spot that is clean  & peaceful with ample seating - and the cortado was perfectly done!  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.",1
Coffee Shop 22,this was the best coffee i had in austin! i had an americano and my girlfriend had a pour over. both were delicious!,1
Coffee Shop 22,Seriously the best latte I've ever had. Breakfast tacos were amazing and their signature salsa was choice.,1
Coffee Shop 22,Really friendly staff and cool place. Cappuccino is impressive. Very great texture. Not bitter. Taste great without sugar. Will come back,1
Coffee Shop 22,Great ambience - one of the best lattes in town.  Laid back and easy going - the Austin I like from when I first moved here almost 20 years ago...,1
Coffee Shop 22,"Best double espresso latte I've had in a long time...creamy, smooth, rich and 0 bitterness. I'll be back.",1
Coffee Shop 22,"Great coffee.  Nice owners.  Flawless, beautiful interior.  Good music.  Very happy to have found this place!",1
Coffee Shop 22,"In a great coffee town with tons of quality shops, Figure 8 reins king.  Can't speak to their cortados, lattes, etc. but the espresso and coffee are the best in town.",1
Coffee Shop 22,Great neighborhood coffee shop. Free wifi and great attentive staff. The only thing I would add to the experience is a no-calorie sweetener option.,1
Coffee Shop 22,I have been here just once. loved it. weird looking cafe with amazing delicious coffee. guys you need to try it :),1
Coffee Shop 22,"Product: The product is on point. I can tell they take pride in making sure every single drink is made to the best of their ability with delightful presentation, which to me is what puts the ""craft"" in craft anything. They are constantly adjusting the grind to make sure it's dialed in and so far it has been perfectly consistent, and consistency is one of the most important things to me for any business. As for food, the pastries they carry are ok but damn, their tacos are delicious! I love Taco Deli tacos, like a lot, but the one's at F8 are actually better and bigger.  Atmosphere: Proper and DIY. I love when I can walk into a place and it immediately hits me with a good vibe. Then when I take a moment to sit and notice small details and decor that I can tell were done with good taste and style on a small budget. That, to me, is so much cooler than walking into a place and it looks like they just sunk a hundred grand into it to impress but it feels stale and contemporary.  Service: So far, so good. I consistently am greeted with a smile, and consistently am asked about my day. No one has ever tried to sell me more than I've asked for. Of course they are both easy on the eyes and new business owners but I don't get a pretentious vibe from either of them. And as far as I know they both grew up in Austin and have been working in coffee shops and bars/restaurants on the east side for many years, which means they have easily earned their place on Chicon.  Complaint: Not enough Figure 8's in town :(",1
Coffee Shop 22,Stumbled upon this little gem by absolute chance!  It's only been open a week but these barista's know their coffee!  Delicious!  Just watching the guy behind the coffee machine put so much love into what he is creating!  May have found a new favorite...,1
Coffee Shop 45,Gluten free peanut butter chocolate chip cookie was AMAZING. Great coffee. Limited seating inside. Outdoor seating with tent and heaters today since it was raining - perfect! Will be back soon to post up and work and eat some more of their delicious baked goods.,1
Coffee Shop 45,"Perfect coffee shop is perfect. I just got a nitro cold brew, and it was great. Sorry I didn't get a chance to come back and try some juice. If I were local, I'd be working my way through their menu on the regs. I was so jealous when I saw they had paleo coconut-based yogurt!! Why can't we have such things in the hipster coffeeshops of the Bay Area?  Environment is gorgeous, with inside and outside seating in a courtyard patio away from the hustle and bustle of South Congress.",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Updated review Really, one of the best coffees I had in a very long time here in the States. So much flavor that it reminded me of being in Italy or Greece. The body of the coffee and taste is just spectacular. I had mine iced with almond milk and just about everything was incredible. From the size to temperature to amount of ice, you name it. The perfect coffee. They also have Kouign Amann which is one of my favorite pastries. It's like a very sweet French croissant with a crown shape. It reminds me of Argentinian medialunas! Childhood memories... This place will be my go-to and must coffee whenever I'm in Austin! Also the surroundings are beautiful. Great location on South Congress and very nice edification with private patio to chill out. Mañana is the coffee of Mañana!",1
Coffee Shop 45,Amazing Cortado and easily accessible on Congress st.  Great patio located between Mañana and South Congress Hotel available to catch up with friends or bask in the sun.  Fast service and attention to service!,1
Coffee Shop 45,"I came by here in a party of 2 a little before 5 on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking: Parking anywhere near South Congress is a hassle, but we parked (for free) on a neighborhood street off West Monroe Street on the block adjacent to South Congress.  Atmosphere: The place is small. 4 chairs in the front as you walk in with a lot of natural light and room to put a laptop or so on the wall table. There is a longer table in the back with space for 6-8 people, and I believe there were two other small 2-person tables for chatting. There are also 3 bar stool like chairs to sit on that look into the workspace. My friend said the back terrace area is usually available as well but was not available due to a wedding reception. I'm not sure if it was just because of the reception, but my friend and I were forced to sit on the bar stools for a couple minutes before we sat near the door after a girl left. Definitely a cutesy cafe though.  Food/drink: I ordered a nitro-cold brew and enjoyed it! I think I would still prefer a regular cold brew if possible, but it wasn't bad.  Service (and some food): My cold brew (which was pre-brewed) didn't come out for like 10 minutes, so after I asked about it, the worker was super apologetic and let my friend and I get a free pastry each on the house! (FYI their pastries are half off after 5 pm anyways). Both the pastries were just good, nothing spectacular but I liked that it was free. They also had water/sparkling water on tap as well.  The coffee was decent, environment was ideal for some chatting, and the service made a fantastic recovery after a mistake. Would like to come back again!! Nitro cold brew Pastries",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Manana is the newest coffee shop on South Congress. It's boho-chic vibe is great for insta pics and interior design therapy. It's honestly beautiful.  The coffee is good and the baristas are friendly. It's more of a destination coffee shop to sit at with a friend and catch up. The set up isn't conducive to working remotely, but that's what I like about it. It's the perfect spot to sit with a couple of pals and talk. Inside or outside, you can't go wrong - it's all lovely. The bar and beautiful Macarons",1
Coffee Shop 45,"I love the location of this coffee shop. Props on free valet parking as well! (As long as you are a hotel guest or eating /drinking at the restaurants)  The baristas are knowledgeable about the coffee (we are not coffee experts so it was nice to have the advice). I loved the cortado... Just enough milk and sweetness. I like my coffee strong and not too sweet so the cortado with a splash of house syrup was spot on.. And the coffee art is the perfect touch.  The macarons are delicious and huge. I hate small macarons!! I loved the PB&J macaron! I'm just dreaming about it now and wish that I had bought more. Oh well, I'll just need to make another trip here! Vanilla latte Peanut butter & jelly macaron with a cortado Cappuccino See all photos from Julie Boolie T. for Mañana Coffee & Juice",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Listed in Did someone say coffee? 5 stars for a solid cup of cappucino, cool and friendly barista, instagram-perfect interior, free parking, and all in all an amazing coffee shop to catch up with a friend, to enjoy solitude and people watch at the seats in the front, or to do work at the big tables in the back.  I also tried friend's nitro brew and it blew me away with how refreshing it tasted! I have still yet to find a place that serves better nitro brew than Manana. If you're new to the party, definitely give it a try!",1
Coffee Shop 45,"4 check-ins I am so excited that this place is open! Manana is modern, hip, and has great,insta-worthy drinks.  Like any downtown establishment, finding parking here is a struggle. But it's a great place to stop by for a quick coffee break from some SoCo shopping! I think people also grab a coffee while in line for South Congress Cafe...  The flavored drinks here are very light, meaning the flavor doesn't overpower the espresso, a feature that is to my liking. Their lattes are just bitter enough for my tastes.  I wouldn't come here to study, due to the minimal seating, but Manana has beautiful wooden tabletops, wide open windows, and a bright but clean layout.  Really cute modern place with great coffee! Definitely one of the best new establishments in Austin. Lattes Beautiful interior with wide windows",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Love Manana, everyone who works their is SUPER FRIENDLY. Isabella is a doll!! Its so nice getting to go into a coffee shop and always feeling welcomed! Thanks to all the staff for being A+ and making great coffee",1
Coffee Shop 45,One of the newest coffee shops I've been to in awhile and Mañana Coffee & Juice didn't disappoint. The ambiance is my favorite and the coffee isn't too shabby as well! It's a perfect place for people who are looking for a good place to study or grab a cup of coffee with an old friend. I highly recommend! :),1
Coffee Shop 45,"I absolutely love Mañana!  They have a rotating espresso every month, so you get to try out new roasters from across the country. But they still have a consistent house blend for creatures of habit. I'm not quite sure where they get their chai, but I'm fairly certain it's made from angel tears.The staff is super friendly and will help you make decisions for the less coffee-inclined among us.  It's the perfect spot to post up and get some work done. The big windows remind you that there is in fact life outside of your laptop, and the Mexican tile and overall aesthetic make it the perfect place to keep you buoyant and happy!  I love seeing that business is picking up, but also a bit sad that I'm going to start having to share this gem. Hands down my favorite coffee spot in town.  But dangit please bring back the vegan sesame cookie!!",1
Coffee Shop 45,"My dad and I had a lengthy discussion recently about how Austin coffee shops have become snooty. Don't worry about that here, because Manana coffee ended up on our ""friendly baristas"" list.  We came in after dropping my car off down the road at Twomey Automotive (see previous Yelp Review- for best car body shop in town). I had been previously to the hotel for their cinco de mayo event, but after coming back realized how much they took out for the event (makes since drunk adults and expensive modern furniture don't mix).  Anyways, we were pleased to be surprised by our service at manana coffee. My cortado (first time getting one) even came served with a heart on top. The décor reminded us of our recent visit to San Antonio, it has that Southwest Texas meets Mexican vibe.  Seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists inside, but as a local we were excited to see this place doing so well on  South Congress. As Austin is booming with new businesses, i'm hoping this one stays- it's got class and good service. I can't wait to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 45,"4 check-ins Friendly barista, good cuvée coffee, slightly hidden, good snacks/quick food, and happy people.  You can find this here. And probably in Copenhagen, but I'll stay here.  The sausage and cheese pastry thingy was super good. I'm excited about this place getting big but also not excited.  Goodnight.",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Manana is part of the new South Congress Hotel, so of course it's gorgeous. It's near the back of the open courtyard area, so it feels like a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of South Congress Road.  So far, their made-to-order drink menu consists only of coffees (which is fine by me) and not yet juices. They do have bottled Juiceland juices in the fridge though.  There's a good amount of pastries to choose from. The one I had was good. They apparently make them in-house. Impressive.  I'd come back to read a book...or the paper, if I did that sort of thing. It's that kind of place.",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Gorgeous space! Great tea selection. Friendly staff. AND they have sparkling water on tap for free, which to this German girl is about as close to heaven as you can get.",1
Coffee Shop 45,"First to Review Listed in dinewithshayda.com Reviews Mañana will feature cold-pressed juice, locally roasted coffee and a small snack menu.

Coffee Shop 45,"If you want a delicious iced drink that has the right amount of sweetness, get the iced vanilla latte!",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Perfect way to spend a rainy day.  I love #exploring. Discovered my new favorite #coffeeshop!  I'm always at a coffee shop and have been to nearly every bakery and coffee shop in #Austin. They use #Cuvee #coffee, which is my fave, and bake all their desserts in house---Macaroons, sesame tahini cookies, savory kolaches, donuts, peanut butter cups, etc. The baristas are friendly and unpretentious as well. :)",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Latte was amazing, and they have nitro cold brew on tap! Super cute, tucked away location too. Latte",1
Coffee Shop 45,"I'm not a coffee shop person, I don't drink coffee but I love this place.  I happened upon it while walking by and figured I'd get a hot tea and small pastry to hold me off until dinner.  They had macaroons (my favorite sweet treat) in four delicious and interesting flavors (raspberry rose water vanilla, grapefruit proseco, almond joy and spiced bourbon pecan).  I initially purchased one and after tasting it, wound up going back to get all four for later.  They were that good. Possibly the best macaroons I've had outside of Paris.  The tea was also very good and the service outstanding.  Only wish they had more locations.",1
Coffee Shop 45,chill staff and atmosphere,1
Coffee Shop 45,"First of all, this place is beautiful. No surprise, since it's part of the South Congress Hotel! The whole place was bright, light and airy, and felt like a breath of fresh air after walking around in the heat. The tiled coffee counter is stunning and so picture-worthy if you're into that. The barista behind the register was super friendly - she actually seemed like she wanted to be there and that she genuinely wanted me to enjoy my experience, which is not always the case with overworked Austin baristas. I resisted the pastries in the case because I knew I didn't need one....but they looked amazing - not your typical coffeeshop pastries. I ordered an iced almond milk latte, like I do at every coffee shop I go to for the first time, and it was excellent. The almond milk was creamy and had a fresh taste with no weird after taste that sometimes comes with almond milk. It didn't overpower the espresso - I need to still be able to tell there is coffee in there, and this was perfect. My one complaint would be that I wish the size was a little bigger, but I'm guessing that it's high quality stuff and they would have to charge more for a bigger size - not a big enough deal to make me remove a star, especially because the ambiance was so wonderful! that tiled coffee bar",1
Coffee Shop 45,"Tucked back in the northeast corner of the SoCo Hotel, this place makes a solid cappuccino. Great ambiance in a tall open and bright space, it's a great spot for coffee with friends or catching up on work.",1
Coffee Shop 45,Great coffee program - even better pastry program.  I'm on an all pastry diet right now so this place has been a godsend.,1
Coffee Shop 45,"Manana was brand new to me, just went to try it on a whim since a friend suggested it! Absolutely loved the minimalist decor and the simplicity of the menu. Made it that much easier to choose something delicious to try. I had the iced latte and added a little bit of agave nectar. It was amazing! Really enjoyed sipping my latte on the outdoor patio as well. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm on SoCo.",1
Coffee Shop 45,Great coffee shop tucked back in the South Congress hotel. Very nice atmosphere and great coffee. Has great nitro cold brew serving cuvée coffee. Definitely recommend,1
Coffee Shop 45,"Cute, modern, hip cafe in Soco. Quality coffee drinks and decent assortment of non-coffee drinks. Pastries are half off 5-7pm. Ample seating inside and outside. Great place to meet friends or get some work done. Would definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 45,"So delicious. For $10 including tip, I was able to try their cortado, an everything kolache with cream cheese, and a peanut butter and jelly macaron. I will definitely be back to get all three again.",1
Coffee Shop 45,These guys just opened and this is a legit place to get coffee. And their pastries are amazing!,1
Coffee Shop 62,"What is in this magical moon milk???!!! The world may never know.  It's magical. It's mystical. It's a bundle of happiness in a cup. If you're trying to avoid an overwhelming amount of sugar and fat, I recommend you get the quartermoon (1/4 moon milk, expresso shots, regular milk). It's fantastic. It might also send you running to the bathroom shortly after... just depends on your caffeine/lactose tolerance.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"First time here to check out this place. It's a small coffee place a few miles from the hustle and bustle of the university. It was about 4:00 Sunday afternoon, and it was not too crowded. All the patrons seemed to be focused on what they were doing. The setting is causal and community-like, which is intentionally catered for nearby university folks. The ""bar"" part refers more to the setting than the fact they serve alcohol. They have long bar tables and chairs, along with a few regular wooden tables in the middle and some small sofa chairs against the inside wall.  We had a wintermoon latte with their much sought-after ""moon milk"". It was very smooth, sweet, and noticeably creamier than usual. We also got a mocha moon. It had all the good stuff of the latte, plus the chocolaty flavor.  If you're out of luck finding a spot inside, you can try the patio in the front. There are a few tables and a bar table on one side. It was from a raised deck with plenty of tree branches hanging over it. Nothing fancy, but it gives you a pleasant view of the traffic on 1st Street when you feel bored on what you're doing.  I have to say parking is no fun. We spotted a space in the parking lot behind the building, but it was a bit too small for our vehicle. We couldn't u-turn out and had to cautiously back our way out. We finally parked on a side street. It was a nice walk to the shop though.  Another thing is this place opens late till 12:00 midnight. So if you need a late night coffee, come on by! Mocha moon (left) and winter moon (right) Nice outside patio to the left Branded merchandise See all photos from Yu-kwong C. for Summer Moon Coffee Bar",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I couldn't focus in my apartment so I looked at my bookmarks and decided to check this place out. No regrets! I got the half moon latte as other reviewers have said the summer moon latte was too heavy and sweet. Half moon is delicious and perfectly made! It's creamy and has the right amount of sweetness. I'm not one for coffees that taste like a straight up milk shakes and I typically drink my coffee black. This drink definitely satisfied my sweet tooth craving.  The atmosphere is very ""austin"" and I was able to get work done. The noise volume wasn't bad and the music wasn't distracting. They have bar counters and a few tables for those who need more space. Really great place for coffee and studying!! Only down side is that parking is a little tricky.",1
Coffee Shop 62,The Moon milk is really good. My wife Had  mocha latte with moon milk she loves it. The mocha latte is good. Fun atmosphere good seating. Busy street,1
Coffee Shop 62,"21 check-ins Summermoon coffee has truly ruined me for all other coffee shops. If their goal is to provide you with a stellar coffee experience by simply delivering on the promise of great coffee- all I can say is well done. I hope I don't find out that one day the secret ingredient ""moonmilk"" which seemingly consists of a minimum of 9 different dairy milks- is some how laced with cocaine! I've never been addicted to a food or beverage before and I can honestly tell you that this was a first. The summer moon latte, 007 and Mocha Moon are all amazing. Make sure when you're heading to downtown or stopping in to Austin you stop by here. Enjoy a breakfast taco and make sure to at least try a summer or winter moon latte.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins The Summermoon latte is AMAZING. I usually get the half moon (so half moon milk, half regular milk) to cut down on the sweetness a bit. The cold brew is always great, as are the regular lattes/american is--super smooth espresso. The baristas are all very friendly and accommodating. Love how they have tacodeli breakfast tacos in the morning, too! I'm sure they sell out, but there has always been a decent taco selection in the mornings on the weekends when I've gone around 9-10am. Summermoon Latte + bacon and egg tacodeli bfast taco = my happy place.  Nice atmosphere for studying and just hanging out, as well.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"The half moon latte at Summermoon ranks among the top coffee drinks I've had in Austin. Whatever they're putting in their moon milk, it sure is tasty. Sunday afternoons are busy... as the quip goes, ""nobody goes there any more, it's too crowded"". Extra parking is available behind the building, thank goodness. Recommended.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Half summermoon was the perfect sweetness. (I can't imagine it more sweet than it already is!) We sat at the patio for a bit. It was packed but the weather was nice.    They were pretty slammed when I was there, so I didn't really get to ask ""what is moon milk?"" I tried to google what moon milk is but it looks like it's got like seven secret ingredients! According to some site, they have almond and soy versions of their moon milk. I'll def have to try those next time!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Awesome latte! Summermoon latte is a must if you're in the area.  The place is small so expect to share a table or sit outside on the patio. But it smells so darn good. I love the smell of coffee but not the candle smells. LOL Friendly staff, great coffee, relaxing atmosphere!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in Austin, TX (ATX) I'm assuming there is crack in that moon milk because omg that (iced) wintermoon latte was delicious. Initially it was too sweet for me (if you're not a fan of sweetness, I'd get a half moon latte) but I think that once the ice started melting, the sweetness mellowed out.  I forgot to check what moon milk was exactly made out of, but it made the iced latte very rich and creamy. Definitely recommend!  This area has plenty of table space and chairs-- the bar concept is pretty cool! Lots of plugs (including USB ports!) to charge your phones and laptops while you work. A perfect study area. :)",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summer Moon is a great place to study and to enjoy great coffee! Today was my first day going, and I am in love with their coffee! I got the Half Summermoon, and it is absolutely delicious! It's the perfect sweetness and is very smooth coffee.  I have wondered after being here in Austin for 2 years, why didn't I come here earlier?  If you are in town for a visit, or here to stay, you gotta come here, it's the best!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This place has been sitting in my bookmarks for months and I finally decided to come. I ordered an iced caramel latte (my go-to drink) but they don't have caramel here.  The barista recommended a half wintermoon because of the hint of caramel flavor mixed in with the vanilla ice cream. I decided to order a bacon, egg, and cheese hand pie too.  Both were so good. Wow. I wish I could have this hand our every morning for breakfast. It's fat, flaky, and filling. And no shortage of cheese (plus for that).  Coffee was good, the perfect amount of sweet for me. I've been decreasing my reliance in sugar in my coffee so thank goodness this wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.  Desk space is limited, with a bar-like type of set up in the middle for people to work in community style, side-by-side. It's interesting and not as uncomfortable as I thought it'd be. There are two good-sized tables so if you need a lot of workspace, try to snag one. The small tables and bar-top setup are OK if you want to just read or journal or something or if you have just a laptop and nothing else. I happened to bring some books with me for Bible study so this was perfect for me.  And I love that it's not too quiet and not too loud. Perfect noise level for working. Parking is limited, and it overflows into street parking when the lot is full (I think). Showing amount of workspace at bar-like setup",1
Coffee Shop 62,"4 check-ins I love Summermoon coffee! So tasty and a nice Sunday morning treat! Too bad it's also so many other people's Sunday delight as there seems to always be a line. Parking is a bit hard to come by at times, but all that aside, willing to put in the work for the deliciousness that is an Iced Half Moon Coffee!!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Good cup of ice coffee.  We got to see another neighborhood in Austin.  Super packed on a Monday afternoon.  We sat outside in the opppressive heat, because there was not a table to be had inside.  Kind of a funky little venue with a tattoo shop and a massage place, and then what looked like private residences.    I liked it.  Not sure if I'd make a special trip over here again, but definitely satisfying if you're in the neighborhood.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"5 check-ins How can you not love Summer Moon.  It kicks ass.  It's a drug and I'm addicted.  If it wasn't for the fact that I'm of all the calories I'm consuming in one sitting, then I'd drink it everyday.  It's strong, tasty and nothing else like it.  The staff is friendly and it gives off those ""keep Austin weird"" vibes.  It's a cute place to do work if you get there early enough for a good spot.  I've had nothing but great experiences here.  I recently left my purse there over night on the patio and it was turned in.  I didn't have a thing missing.  Talk about good people and great staff.  They will always hold a dear place in my heart for their integrity. See all photos from Ann Marie N. for Summer Moon Coffee Bar",1
Coffee Shop 62,"9 check-ins Summer Moon Coffee Bar has strategically placed their locations around Austin to accommodate ....me!    With locations off of Burnet, S. 1st and Buda , they have graciously placed caffeine near my home, work and a best friend.  So very kind of them.  Try the summermoon, their signature drink.  It is basically a latte made with crack.  I mean, milk.  I mean, there might be crack in the milk.  Whatever they put in there, it is sweet and i start to itch if i don't have one every few days. If it is too sweet, try ordering it as a half- moon and they cut back on the sugary milk.  Also, you can get your moon milk made with almond milk for a non dairy option.  Try a bag of their house roasted coffee, it is stellar and has a slightly smokey taste from their wood burning oven.    Can we talk about the hand pies?  They are buttery, flaky and come in many flavors.  I suggest the chicken pot pie.  The new Burnet location also serves TacoDeli tacos.    Open early at 6am, service is always wonderful (particularly with the 1st street AM staff).   Popular study and chill spot.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins What a delicious cup of coffee I had this morning. I had to try this moon milk everyone was talking about and I don't regret my detour to work.  I'm 90% sure I'm lactose intolerant so I had to ask if I could get their SummerMoon with soy milk and they could! He said they had a dairy free alternative called the Tokyo! Didn't see it on the menu but WOOHOO! He also said their coconut milk alternative was called the Beach Boys. Lol the other barriers wasn't familiar with the names so I think he just made them up but they should definitely think about adding it on the board.  SummerMoon/Tokyo was delicious! I felt like I was drinking milk tea cause it was so creamy and smooth. It was also the perfect level of sweet! I do like my coffee sweet but it wasn't TOO sweet. I got a 12 oz and I wish I got a bigger cup!  The interior was also super cute with a lot of single seats like a bar type tables. Seemed pretty calm and relaxed so I could see myself getting some work done but I'm not sure about it being a good study spot.  Tl;dr - try anything with moon milk! They can do soy or coconut alternatives, just ask. It's deliciously smooth and perfectly sweetened. Tokyo! The SummerMoon with a soy moon milk alternative",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in Austin, Texas Wood-fired roasted coffee? With Austin and it's wood fired BBQ culture this seemed like a great spot to check out the coffee scene.  The proprietary Moon milk brought happiness to everyone that sampled it. It was creamy and sweet but not cloying. It's a great signature drink.  Loved the local wares they had for purchase. I bought some hand crafted Austin mud soap for gifts that declared ""strong enough for a hippy weak enough for a ceo.""  The coffee shop was full of people on a Wednesday night. It was a hip college aged/young professionals crowd. The guys I were with enjoyed ogling the hot Austin babes that patronized Summer Moon Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in 200 Review Self-Challenge, Coffee-holic So I read the Yelp reviews for the epic Espresso Milkshake so of course I had to try it! Went here later in the afternoon on a Monday where it was pretty packed. They have an bar-style island in the middle of the shop where people (aka students and home-business types) were hording space near the ""working"" outlets along the table. I ordered my milkshake and had a nice chit-chat with the barista before finding a seat. First attempt to charge my phone I was apparently using a ""dead"" outlet so keep this in mind. Also the combination of a lot of students in the place lead to overhearing non-sense drama of student-life.  The espresso milkshake was okay. It wasn't as coffee flavored or chocolatey as I hoped and read on Yelp. It was more icy and milky which wasn't terrible but not worth the price and the trip to the So-Fi district of ATX via bike or Uber (if you don't have a reliable mode of transportation skip it). As a visitor that comes from the NYC metro area, I had high expectations and unfortunately this place wasn't all too great as some expressed online. They do have pastries but didn't see much other food options. No sure about the Wi-Fi and password situation since I didn't stay long enough to need it. One plus about this place is the quietness and the mellow music playing.",0
Coffee Shop 62,3 check-ins My friend is obsessed with this coffee shop and even has me loving it too! I like to get the half wintermoon. It's delicious and has just enough sweetness. The secret is in their Moon Milk. What is it you ask? I have no earthly idea but it has me coming back whenever I visit Austin. Try the Wintermoon if you have a super sweet tooth. I tried their tacos once. I can't remember what I got but it was pretty good and cheap. I'm sure it's hard to find a bad taco in Austin. Overall a great spot to grab quality coffee and get some work done.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"25 check-ins I love Summer Moon. Dare I say I'm a Summer Moon-aholic?! Wait that's only if you admit to the problem. I don't think going there at least 4 times a week and dreaming about it is a problem. A problem is if I would day dream about how to make my own Moon Milk - realize I will never unearth the recipe and accept the fact I will spend my life savings at Summer Moon. A problem would be buying a t-shirt from there hoping it would smell like Moon Milk and then I would never wash it. Ever. A problem would be buying a mug from there and hoping/wishing/praying that Moon Milk would magically appear in my bland coffee like some kind of Harry Potter voo doo.  Well since I do none of that I can just say that Summer Moon is amazing. The Moon Milk is one of a kind and made of unicorn tears. Just what I imagined unicorn tears to taste like.  If you haven't gone and are on the fence go. We start a support group together. Meeting place? Summer Moon,",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summer Moon Coffee Bar is that place I wish I had close to my college campus where I can grab my coffee, put in my headphones and knock out a class assignment.  Love the atmosphere and vibe of this place.  Call me boring, but I have only had their house coffee and nothing more, but the flavors are amazing!!  My only complaint I have is that the service could be slow.  I took a friend here who was visiting and was craving local coffee shops and only ordered a latte with almond milk.  I swear it must have taken more than 10 minutes to get her coffee and we had to remind the staff that we were still waiting for hers.  Were they out of almond milk and ran to the store to get it?  Did they forget?    I guess we will never know.  But even though that service may have been slow, I still recommend this place.  Its not often you mind a good coffee shop that is unique and actually makes good coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This place wins the award for some of my favorite coffee in town. Great place for swinging by, or to get some work done.  I've had friends who have worked here, and they have very positive things to say about the staff and management - that means a lot to me.  My only complaint is that I always feel rushed here (which may be a symptom of their size and the amount of traffic they get) and the staff often seems rushed to get all the things done. I don't know if thats an easy thing to fix, but it has made me avoid going here with groups of people (unless just picking up coffee to-go, b/c its soooo good).  When solo'ing a work day in South Austin, I find myself stopping here often.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"My favorite coffee I had in Austin. So good! Try the breakfast tacos for a swift start to the day.  Also, their lattes are the best. Creamy, delicious and served with a smile.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins Listed in Om Noms Austin Props to Summermoon for making me able to drink my first cup (okay, 1/4 cup) of black coffee! Personally, I'm not too crazy about coffee and don't actually enjoy the taste of it most of the time and never (before Summermoon) could I drink it black. Plenty of milk and sugar is usually how I roll.  My first couple experiences here, I tried their variety of lattes which are made with infamous Moonmilk-- a sweetened milk spiced with a secret blend of spices and everything nice. The Summer Moon is super sweet, too much so even for me, so my favorite of all was their Half Moon (half as sweet as the Summer). Their Mocha Moon has a nice deeper flavor and wasn't too chocolatey. They also offer seasonal options like an Autumn Moon (pumpkin spiced) in the Fall and Peppermint Joy in the Winter all of which were delicious.  As for their drip coffee, I recently took one of my brothers here while we were touring around Austin and he's a purist when it comes to coffee. When he took his first sip, his eyes perked up and he said that it was really good so I decided that I would try it and I liked it a lot! I still prefer mine with cream and sugar though. I don't really know coffee enough to know what makes one cup better than another, but I believe my brother and all the other people who know coffee who are crazy about this place to know that there's something truly special here at Summermoon.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I literally cannot quit Summermoon. I thought it would be helpful to buy the beans to make at home, but alas, it doesn't keep me from venturing in for the beloved moon milk. Excited to see them open so many stores to spread their delicious products!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I've been a resident of this cafe for the last five years. If I could place a cot in there, I would... but there's no room.  Like everywhere else that's popular in Austin, there's shitty parking and make sure you're prepared to stand in a line (unless you get there at 7 am on a weekday). Park on the street (in the correct direction if you're not a moron). And be prepared to listen to endless drivel from boring spoiled UT kids.  They recently re-did the menu boards, taking off the prices. I don't like that. That's sketchy AF. The prices went up. Don't let them fool you.  When it's hot as balls outside, drink the 1/2 wintermoon. It's not as sweet as the ""normal"" wintermoon, but it's still very sweet. Add an extra shot or four if you feel crazy.  Do yourself a favor and sit outside. It's cozy on that cute porch. They don't take orders from the window anymore, sadly, but that's okay! It's not that hard to get up and go stand in that line inside ;)  TLDR: drinks are great (GET THE HALF WINTERMOON, NOW). food is decent but nothing to write home about if you're a tourist. parking sucks.  PS: the baristas could benefit from some taking some empathy or customer service courses. Life is not that ugly, dude.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"First, their coffee is absolutely heaven in a cup. I'm not a huge fan of iced coffee or overly sweet drinks, so I always get the half moon latte. Words cannot describe what happens to your mouth or brain as you drink it. It's straight up ambrosia. I find myself laying up awake some nights thinking about that latte.  The reason that they lose a star is for ambiance. While it seems to be a great place to work, it's not really a place where I would ever meet a friend just for coffee and a chat. They have the straight-up dingiest fabric chairs along their back wall. I literally feel like I need to change my clothes after sitting on them. I'm not kidding - I would literally find it preferable to sit on the bare floor. Unfortunately, there's nowhere else inside to sit if you are just there for fun, and those dirty chairs are usually open. (I wonder why!)  If Summer Moon invested in swapping those terrible lounge chairs out, I would probably visit a lot more! In the end, their moon lattes are terrific, but seating not so much.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins Listed in Java Me Up! My favorite coffee bar in Austin. This trip was funny really, the barista offered to give us our drinks for free if I gave her my shirt.. Lauren suggested after we left I should have traded her for the totes cute Summer Moon tee she had on. I guess she really wanted my Star Wars tee..  But- let's talk about the actual coffee. They roast the been in house, old school style with wood- and the smell is something dreams are made of- ahhhhh. And of course, the Moon Milk- I'm sure sweetened condensed milk is one of the ingredients,  but it has some magic sprinkled in there too- or crack like Lauren said :).  I always go with one of their signature drinks- Summer Moon is hot and the Winter Moon is iced and you can get them as is or ""half"". I suggest trying half first unless you like super sweet drinks then by all means go full Monty. Half winter moons",1
Coffee Shop 62,"If you like Starbucks flavored drinks, you'll probably love this place. Much better coffee but still a sweet vanilla flavor!  For me personally, the summermoon is way too sweet (no coffee taste whatsoever) and the Half moon was really good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. If I do go back, I'll probably just try a regular latte or cappuccino.  Inside is tightly packed, and it gives off the 'late night study' vibe to me. I liked the atmosphere, but it was a bit loud inside and pretty packed with people.  Pros: good smooth strong flavor Cons: noisy, parking is difficult, too sweet",0
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins Listed in Food Adventures in Austin Summermoon Coffee Bar prides itself in its brewing technique that uses wood fire to roast the coffee. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I can tell you that this technique works. The coffee here is simply amazing. If you're a coffee drinker like me then you'll love this place. I'm that person who needs at least 4 packets of sugar and 2 packets of cream in my coffee (don't judge!).  Here's what I tried, and why they're all amazing --  1. Summermoon -- Sweetest of them all. 2. Half Moon -- Perfectly sweet as it has half of the Summermoon. 3. Autumn Moon -- Made for PSL lovers like me. However, it's better than the PSL. Not too sweet or syrup-y, and you can smell all the 'pumpkin' spices. 4. Mocha Moon -- Rich chocolate flavor that isn't too sweet or overwhelming.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in Vegetarian Food + Austin I came here with a friend on Sunday morning and this place was already packed by 9:30AM. The comfy seating indoors was mostly taken, especially all of the couches. They had a lot of empty stools inside, but sitting on a stool for a few hours = back pain. We ended up finding two chairs right by the door. Although they have outdoor seating, it had just rained and everything was damp.  Summermoon gets great business. But that also means it gets loud and the inside has an overall cluttered feel to it. I prefer more of a calmer ambiance.    I'm not much of a coffee person, so I ordered the carrot apple smoothie and vegan pot pie. Both were good (although expensive). They also don't take Discover or American Express, so I had to pay with the limited cash I had on me.  The restrooms are located in the hallway outside and open by a code clearly labeled inside the shop. Free wifi is available, and the password is also clearly labeled. They also have a good number of outlets inside.",1
Coffee Shop 62,The coffees super good but 1. They compare pro choice people to nazi's (Google the article about it) 2. I ordered a large winter moon without ice and they filled it up to how much a small would be. At least give me my dollar back then. Ugh. That's bullsh***. There is about 3 inches left of room to fill it up.,0
Coffee Shop 62,"I was super excited to get a coffee from summer moon cafe, however after today I will not going back. Today I had a terrible customer service experience after pointing out to the barista that our drink was lacking vanilla. Instead of remaking the drink the barista became defensive. I told her she can taste it herself but she said she will just add more flavor, so she's goes back and pours tons of vanilla in the drink making it even worse, it was like drinking sugar water. After paying $8 for Americanos you would expect amazing service, we work very hard to pay such a high amount for a drink but after reading the reviews we thought it would be worth it, but today was out first and last time supporting this local business.",0
Coffee Shop 62,I would say that if you enjoy very sweet coffee drinks that this place could be for you. They make milkshakes and that might be the best thing here. Clean new place.  Check out the politics if you care about that sort of thing.,0
Coffee Shop 62,"this place has my FAVORITE LATTE ever to be made. and that's a bold statement.  get the SUMMERMOON. (and if its iced, they call it the WINTERMOON). a combination of sweet, silky, smooth.. wait am i describing a latte or how i like my men?  the only thing, ONLY THING! i would change about this space is maybe more natural lighting / more lighting in general inside the cafe. a TON of people love to come and study / do work here, and so its hard to find seating near the window and then its dark when you're not near the window. i wish it were a bit bigger (both the cafe and the parking lot) also because of the crowd! (ok so maybe i would change 3 things: lighting, space, parking).  but seriously. i love this place.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"2 check-ins I have a friend named Summer, and I didn't know there could be anything sweeter!  Parking lot is terrible but I'm still glad they have their own private lot.  Space is kind of cramped but there are plenty of outlets and a nice little patio outside where you can get your studying on.  Here's the difference: Wintermoon is iced and Summermoon is hot. That's all. I got the Wintermoon and wow, it was delicious but I'm not even going to question how much cream they put in it...If you're not a fan of super-sweet coffee, get the half moon.  I also wish they have more pastries selections. They barely had anything around the time I came (6:30 PMish~)  Their other location is still on my to-try list! wintermoon patio",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This is absolutely my favorite coffee shop in all of Austin, and trust me I've tried them all.  I've always been a latte person, and their Wintermoon is by far the best latte I've ever had in my whole life. That's a huge statement, and I know it.  If you're not into super sweet lattes, I suggest getting a half Wintermoon then, it has less of their Moon Milk and is less sweet but still so tasty.  If you're going there to study, they don't have a whole lot of seating. I've never really had a problem with finding a place to do my work, but just a heads up!  It's pretty small so it wouldn't be the best place for a large group meeting. Although they do have a large outside patio good for nice Austin days!    All in all: it's an Austin must. MUST. Wintermoon my one true love!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I love coming here every time I'm in Austin. The coffee is amazing of course but even their breakfast burritos were great.  For coffee I typically get the Moonraker or wintermoon. Both are the perfect cold drink and that moon milk...like liquid crack.  I also like their ground coffee and use it for home brewing because the flavor a are not harsh like other coffees  The breakfast burrito I had was the bacon and cactus burrito, which I was hesitant about, but it was perfect. The cactus was like a bell pepper so it wasn't too crazy.  This is just an amazing coffee shop in a very unassuming location, but to pass it up would be a shame. Amazing wood fired coffee",1

Coffee Shop 62,"Before I get into the details, if you're just skimming these reviews... Buy a HALF WINTER MOON LATTE (basically a semi-sweet ICED coffee). This is the drink to buy here.  Let me first preface... this 5 star review is based pretty much solely on the TASTE of the ICED COFFEE. I'm comparing based on yumminess relative to all other iced coffee varieties I've had. If you're looking for a standard cold brew with no additives, or if you want a well-lit work space, then this rating would be lower. The coffee is so good that I've decided to basically ignore the issues. I crave this coffee when I come home from being away.  Pros: - I have had pretty much every ice coffee / cold brew in Austin at this point, and the Half Winter Moon latte is as good as it gets. That said, if you don't like your coffee milky and a bit sweet then you likely have a very different measure for iced coffees - Line moves pretty quickly, tho it is generally long - Lots of cool swag that they switch out every few months it seems (I have several mugs and mason jars myself) - No other ""wood fired"" coffees in town that I know of. There's really not much else that tastes like it  Cons: - The parking is bad (but it's the same pretty much anywhere in Austin so I don't notice anymore) - The seating is limited and not very awesome (they used to have a much cooler set up that fit the aesthetic more, but the new counter has lots of outlets and fits more people) - No prices on the board, which they changed and is kinda weird",1
Coffee Shop 62,"So, I want to start off by saying that I come here quite frequently. The coffee here is great there's never any issue with that regards.  However, the more and more I visit this establishment the more I'm disappointed in the staff. The gentleman taking orders today was very nice and polite, but the three guys that were making the coffee's never once smiled, acknowledged any customers and when I asked a SIMPLE question you would have thought I asked for the world.  This seems to be a reoccurring theme at all the small coffee shops in Austin.  I will visit back here again because I live right next door, but if they don't get their sh*t together with the customer service I won't be back. I know I can go to Starbucks where the coffee is garbage but at least the staff is friendly, smiles and is helpful!",0
Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill Hey friends, don't get me wrong, okay?! The ""secret 7-ingredient recipe"" moon milk is AMAZING. It tastes like coffee creamer on vanilla ice cream steroids. Always down for vanilla ice cream steroids. But in my Half Wintermoon (yup, I even got the half sugar option), it was a little too sweet. Like, ""the back of my throat hurts a little bit"" too sweet. For a rich, decadent drink - if I'm ever craving a caffeinated milkshake - I would come here in a heartbeat, but for a daily go-to coffee fix, I'd pass on the Wintermoon.  The chicken cordin bleu hand pie was DELICIOUS. Buttery, golden crust, and a creamy, flavorful chicken & cheese & ham filling. Loved it.  The place itself is pretty chill. I like the music! However, all of the table space is relatively small, aside from two larger square tables. If you're working with textbooks and a laptop, Summermoon probably wouldn't be ideal, unless you happen to get one of those bigger tables. But if you're here to do laptop work or read a book, it's great!",1

Coffee Shop 62,"I love this place. We came here to enjoy a cup of cafe after a long day. I got plain drip coffee and the ""bae"" (as the kids say) got the half moon. Both of us were very VERY pleased with our choices. I even bought whole beans to make the sweet nectar from the gods at home.  If you like really sweet coffee go for the Summermoon. But neither of us can drink things that sweet so the half moon is perfect in our opinion.  Go here. You'll love it. I promise.  Four stars for no real mugs. I don't mind paper cups, but a trendy shop like this should offer mugs.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"You guys. This coffee must have crack in it or something- I'm literally OBSESSED and ADDICTED! It really is so good. Sometimes the full ""summermoon latte"" is a little too sweet. Order the 3/4 Moon if you want that yummy moon milk, just less sugary!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summer Moon is without a doubt my favorite coffee shop in Austin! I have tried many coffee shops to compare, and honestly nothing comes close to the incredible coffee at Sumer Moon.

Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge Summer Moon is this cute, little, eclectic, coffee bar right outside of downtown Austin.  It is as ""Austin"" as it gets.  Upon entering you immediately notice the array of different people from all different walks of life, hanging out, studying and just enjoying their awesome coffee.  I was first introduced to this wonderful place last summer.  I spent all day in hair and makeup, as two of my friends were getting married.  My husband, did not have to spend all day in hair and make up and got to run around town tasting all that Austin had to offer.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I do love it when my coffee doesn't get all acidic and sour and that was a huge plus. They wood-fire roast their coffee (I'm not even sure what it does exactly but it sounds fancy, and fancy always means delicious?) which makes them different than a lot of places.    However, it's that moon milk that makes this place.  It's so creamy and not overly sweet, but just all sorts of amazing.  I'm usually pretty good at replicating things that I taste, but I can't seem to get this right!

Coffee Shop 62,"This is going to be an overly optimistic review. 4 stars IS generous, but warranted.  According to Belly, I have checked into this location 726 times since 04/2012. Shame on me for never writing a review.  I go to Summermoon for the great coffee and fantastic people.  Moonmilk is amazing. I've heard most of the rumors about what it is, but the baristas keep their lips tightly sealed about the exact recipe. The latest rumor is that it's melted down Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream (I hope that one is true).  The moonmilk mystery adds to the experience. It's complex flavor keeps you wondering what it is, but you don't know, so you sip more to try to know. It's close to a religious experience. Extreme, I know.  The staff are the best. I have a great relationship, as a regular, with each barista. Those behind the counter are hipsters. They'll remind you they're people and not only your order takers. Appreciate them because they're about serve you (probably) the best coffee you've ever had.  The rest of what you read in the reviews are true. The parking is difficult, the bathroom is outside and unclean, the coffee shop is small... on and on...  I don't know about you, but I go to a coffee shop FIRST for coffee. When I find something rare and unique like Summermoon, overcoming the hurdles is justifiable and don't take away from a positive rating.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"5 check-ins Best cup of coffee I have EVER had!  I know this seems like a bold statement but let me assure you I have drank a lot of coffee in my 40 years on this planet. I have had a best cup of coffee experience once before about 15 years ago but it has been knocked off its throne by the Summermoon latte.  We were looking for a place to grab an evening coffee before what was going to be a late night in Austin. Found this place on yelp and headed to Summermoon.  When we first walked in I noted that this appeared to be your average little coffee shop with tables and chairs scattered about with people illuminated from the glow of their laptops. As I approached the coffee bar I was expecting to be greeted with the I'm too cool to help you attitude so common among baristas. I was shocked when the girl greeted me with an enthusiastic, ""Hey! How are you guys? Looks like you've been doing something fun. What are your plans for the 4th of July? That sounds so cool!"" Wait. What? A friendly barista can this be true? It is!!  I then looked over their menu. Settled on the Summermoon latte. It is a latte made with ""moon milk"". I have no idea what is in moon milk as that is a secret. It is milk with I believe 7 secret ingredients. What ever it is it is stinking DELICIOUS!!  My latte arrived quickly and was delivered by another equally friendly employee. Upon my first sip I knew I had discovered my perfect cup of coffee. I have been in Austin for 2 more days and I have awoken each morning wanting another cup. I won't be leaving here today without one!!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"The wood-fired coffee is super yummy. We always grab a bag to bring home to FL each time we come back to Austin. The Moon Milk is totally over the moon. I've got my suspicions as to what it is, but I won't be so unkind as to share my ideas (or their secrets).  The line is always long (which is fine, the coffee is good so I get it) but the service is super slow. It's as if like each employee is competing to prove which one of them cares less about costumers. Fortunately for the business owners, the quality of the coffee is worth forgiving the total lack of customer service.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"This place is super chill. They offer breakfast tacos in the morning, and their coffee is really good. They have plenty of outlets and have their wi-fi code displayed pretty obviously throughout the place. I highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 62,Came here to get a coffee to go and wow so good. We got the summer moon latte in the 20 oz. it comes with 3 shots but we got a 4th shot complimentary woot! They make their coffee with this special concoction called moon milk. Yes it tastes as deliciously mysterious as it sounds. It was described to us as a mixture of melted vanilla Icecream and toasted marshmallows. How can you go wrong with that? They also offer the half moon which is less sweet but I think the original tasted perfect just the way it is. A lot of coffee shops I go to is for the ambiance but I'll be coming back here for the delicious coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"This is one of those, ""five star reviews but I sure do have something to say."" I come here at least 1x a week. The MM is shamefully the bomb.com and the vibes are good. Heck I even had my first date with my current boyfriend here. Good networking. Love the spinach egg and cheese tacos. Parking blows but welcome to ATX. Get the Wintermoon (iced) or Summermoon (hot) latte and your life will be complete. Everyone is always smiling and happy, EXCEPT the crotchety cashier/barista. There is a dude man (haven't seen his sour face in a month or so), and particularly this petite brunette lady with lenses. I'm twice her size and still feel like she is going to spit fire or eat me alive if I don't order fast enough or if I waited in line 10 minutes to simply ask if you had any more bfast tacos left like it was a huge waste of HER time. Hi. Welcome to a cafe. We're the ones in a rush, not you. I'm a cashier myself, and know that once I clock in, I'm now a smiling ray of freakin sunshine no matter what. Welcome to adulthood where we suck it the hell up :-) It's a dark place but pays the bills.  I would never give this place a bad rating due to one poor employee. This place ROCKS. My only suggestions are: 1) teach her how to make a coffee and give her dark sunglasses 2) take a few minutes to create a quick sign you can stick up by the tacos to avoid customers waiting for one taco to find out (and possibly be stabbed) there are none left. 3) there are unfamiliar customers constantly walking up the outside ramp to see if the order window is indeed in play. Which it rarely is. I sit out here often & I just point them back inside. Again, all it takes is a friendly sign :-)",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Came on a saturday night and it was pretty empty, the barista was really friendly and helpful.  i ordered a wintermoon and it was DELICIOUS! it was sweet and creamy with still enough coffee flavor. it may be too sweet for some so consider getting the half wintermoon or you can even do a quarter wintermoon! but nonetheless that first sip was a very pleasant surprise. the actual store is really cute and cozy with outlets all around! (*good for studying*) the tables are a little small though so if you need to sprawl out you might need to claim one of the few tables they have. overall i really enjoyed the ambiance and the coffee and DEFINITELY will be coming back! :)",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in I enjoy beverages One random weekday night I seemed to find myself needing a place to work in south Austin. Hey! This place has wood fired coffee. Not sure what it means but it broke the tie between the abundance of Austin coffee shops.  Coffee: I had the regular drip wood fired and accidentally put too much half and half so it was realllly good. But I think it was also the coffee's fault. Yum!  Working: I easily found a spot with a plug for my laptop and I didn't feel cramped. This place doesn't hold a ton of people and I liked that. Less annoyance. I felt surprisingly comfortable here - I think because most everyone was working quietly for the few hours I was. Not a lot if chatty cathys or whatever.  Bathroom is in the hall. Cheat sheets on the tables for passwords. Nice place, I would return!!!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"104 check-ins Summermoon is my ultimate favorite coffee - in the world, hands down.  I am a religious customer and have been ever since I discovered this place several years ago. The Half Wintermoon with 4 shots of espresso is my drink of choice. It costs just as much as a drink from Starbucks but 10 times better (about $5 for a 20 ounce).  The Wintermoon alone is a little too creamy for me, although still delicious. I recently switched to regular coffee of the day (cheaper and warmer) with the famous secret 'Moon milk.' Moon milk is organic, sweet, and a curious buttery milk.  You still get that unique creamy taste you can't get anywhere else in Austin. The coffee is also the only wood fired coffee in Austin.  This place can get pretty full because it's a great place to study. I love taking a book or laptop here and hanging out for a couple hours. There are also breakfast tacos in the mornings I'd you get there earlier enough!  Parking in the front can get crowded, so try the back parking lot or side streets.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I'm gonna keep this at 4 stars because I've never really worked from another café before but this was pretty good. I came here to get a little work done and it was a fun break from the monotonous work from home life. The music was cool, plenty of outlets and chairs. The important part though is the coffee and drinks. Pretty freakin good. I don't really drink coffee or tea but I tried some and I was not disappointed at all. I would definitely come again. I had the frozen chai and it was like a tea smoothie. Perfect for summer.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Went to summer moon today and got a 20ounce summer moon decaf because I can't have caffeine due to high blood pressure but I still like my coffee.i have to say the moon milk is so good and slightly sweet.Its no wonder why people talk about it!I also got 2 pounds of coffee, this coffee is so full flavored because it is fire roasted you can really taste.i wish we had a summer moon in round rock or cedar park. Best coffee Large decaf summermoon The best coffee ever!",1
Coffee Shop 62,Updated reviewI have been back at least twice since my original review and the coffee is still great.  I loved the beans that I had ground and drank at work . . . I must be careful not to get it all the time or I'll be a snob.  I do have to be able to live off of HEB coffee most of the time.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summermoon is my FAVORITE coffee shop, and I have been to many in my day. I live in this neighborhood, but I'm about to move so I will definitely be missing this place. Although I'm not quite as much of a fan of their hot drinks (the cappuccinos are overly foamy), this is completely made up for by how great their iced drinks are. The moon milk is SOO good. Whatever the combination, it makes the best flavored latte I've ever had. I recommend the moonraker (if you can handle 4 shots of espresso) or the wintermoon latte. Staff is also very friendly and will remember your order if you come in a lot. I also like that they offer the Belly rewards points that add up to earn you a free shirt or drink.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I never stepped foot into Summermoon yet since I'm over a thousand miles away...but I've been feeding my addiction ordering their coffee beans online. Who knew the start of loyalty would stem from my friend bringing me back a bag of coffee beans to try from her recent trip to Austin?  --Velvet Blaze: Their signature bean! It's pretty well-rounded but probably the most oily, so I had to play around with the ratio of bean to water a bit. Very balanced flavor profile and low acidity. I'm a fan.  --Swinging Lantern: This consisted of 3 different roasts (light, medium, and dark). It's a unique concept, but it didn't work for me. There was an unfavorable cinnamon aftertaste from the light roast beans. I wouldn't get this again.  --Wild Fire: This is my favorite so far, but it's no surprise since Sumatra is my favorite type of bean. This will be a regular order for sure!  I still have a bag of En Fuego coffee beans to try. I'll revisit this review when I do :)  Pricing is very reasonable (almost a steal, really!): $12.95 per bag and free shipping if you order 3 or more bags. My current favorite coffee bean is sold only in-store at a shop in LA and this is priced at $22 per bag, but it doesn't have the complexity and hard work of a wood-fire roasted bean. Summermoon is now my main coffee source with its great quality roasts and reasonable prices!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I want to make sure this review is clear - this is for the S 1st location only.   The coffee is wonderful!  I visit Summer moon at least 3 days a week between living in Buda and working in Austin. But aside from their consistently amazing coffee, the baristas have been annoyed and rude with snippy remarks. The same girl on three different occasions (prompting this review) has rolled her eyes at me after clarifying if I wanted my drink hot or cold.  She's seems inconvenienced to take my order and frankly I now avoid this location. Love their coffee, but they need an internal review of their staff and attitudes.",0
Coffee Shop 62,Mmmmmmm that moon milk is somethin delicious for a dessert coffee.  If you don't have a sweet tooth maybe just try the half moon milk with your coffee.  The wood roasted beans really do have a different flavor from most coffee joints - really unique and worth the trek out!  Warning: not much parking in their little lot but there's street parking down the residential street.,1
Coffee Shop 62,"This coffee shop came as a recommendation from a local airBnB (basically an online website to book an overnight stay using someone's home/apt) but anyways, she said it was the best coffee ever and let me tell you it's one of the best lattes I've ever had! They have summermoon(hot) , wintermoon(over ice) and then half moon which is what I got. The half moon is half as sweet as the summer moon. They make it with what is called moon milk and it's only 7 ingredients but it's a family secret.  The girl who took my order and made my latter also threw in an extra shot for free. Smoothest, and creamiest latte!! I will get one on my way out of Austin!  Only downfall is parking. I did get lucky and pull right into a spot but there isn't enough Peking so park on side street.

Coffee Shop 62,"Three stars off for faux Daria telling me, ""It's not 'unicorn milk' it's called moon milk. Unicorn milk is a joke."" So sad she thinks that's a point she needed to make.  I'm from NYC and when I moved here my friend told me, ""That place has a thing called unicorn milk."" It was a cute innocent thing.  I remembered that fact and that's why I asked her if she wanted to have coffee at Summermoon.  We walked outside and I said: ""What the fuck was that?""  Austin, there's a decay here.  Try to hire people who aren't so literal.  Big picture people. You know, the ones that get you're running a business. That comprehend humor and how it aligns with marketing trends. You know, the unicorns.",0
Coffee Shop 62,"Whatever they mix up to make 'moon milk' is heavenly. I probably don't want to know because I imagine it's condensed milk, evaporated milk and possibly some crack. On a recent road trip with one of my besties she started talking about this moon milk. Once we hit 5 p.m. traffic in Austin I said let's go get some coffee and bypass this cluster f**k of traffic on 35! We hightailed it to Summermoon and both ordered iced coffees half sweet. If I remember correctly that is a half wintermoon. So delicious and creamy. I can't see myself getting a full amount of sweetener because half was more than enough. While my friend went to the restroom the barista was chatting me up and gave me great directions to take some back roads through town and even drew me a cute map. I'll be back the next time I am in town.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I'm not a Coffee Lover and it always makes my stomach a bit grumpy, but I needed some energy for the day. Houstonian that was visiting Austin btw! Looked up nearby breakfast spots and this caught my eye...so  I drove for a minute and there I was! It's such a cute spot with enough sunlight to let you see your screen, but dim enough to create a relaxed vibe. (Side Note: Parking sucks but that's an ATX thing it seems)  I ordered the Half Winter Moon Mocha Iced (I think the order of the words are wrong?) and a Potato, Egg, Cheese Taco and Spinach, Egg, Cheese Taco. Tacos were too bland...I mean maybe if I ate it there with some hot sauce or something...maybe?  However, the Half Winter Moon made me fall in love with coffee!

The ""moon milk"" is amazing but very sweet (they offer a ""half moon"" which is half as sweet) They will let you try a little shot of the moon milk. I suggest this because it is very sweet, but not overly sweet once espresso shots are added.  -moon mocha was amazing and not bitter at all  -half winter moon was very good but maybe not quite sweet enough. I wanna go back and try a full winter moon with 4 shots to cut the sweetness.  Will be back!!!! This is a must try Austin spot.",1

Coffee Shop 62,"3 check-ins Much prefer the half wintermoon over the mocha wintermoon (a tad too sweet). Not sure what moon milk is... but it tastes.... buttery? We came right at 10am and were able to find parking no problem, but as we were waiting for our drinks, there was definitely a line almost to the door. No problem though, just park in the back!",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Summermoon doesn't seem like the best place to do work. I've never tried but it's sort of small.  That said, I don't do much work at coffeeshops. Usually, the only business I'm attending to is the business of getting caffeine.  Summermoon has a magically thing called moonmilk. I don't really know what's in it (other than, presumably, condensed milk) but it's totally amazing. I have to assume that it's horribly unhealthy because everything that tastes this good has to be unhealthy.  Plus, the wood-roasted coffee really does have a different taste to it. I've got pretty basic taste when it comes to coffee and don't normally have brand preferences but Summermoon is the first coffee I've had that really stood out as better.  The big downside, however, is that it's only open until Midnight M-F and 10PM on Saturday. I drive for Lyft on the weekends and those hours make it hard to swing by for a midnight coffee run on Saturdays.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Listed in Best Coffee Shops Summermoon is a great coffee house with two unique things that make it special.  Let me start with the basics first: there s a parking lot but it can be a challenge at peak times. I have been able to park around the block, which I don''t mind when the coffee is worth it, like at Summermoon.  There is a outdoor seating space and there is plenty of indoor comfy space too. You will almost always find people working or doing homework. Free WiFi of course.  The coffee is very good. I always have a latte or the house latte. The first special thing about this place is their wood fired/roasted coffee. I don't know if it makes the coffee taste better or if I am predisposing myself, but it feels very smooth, almost anti-Stabucks.  The house special uses their own moon mil, which is the other unique thing at Summermoon. It is a bit to sweet and creamy for me but it is different and worth trying.  Right now, this is my go-to place for south central Austin coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 62,"I love exploring coffee shop and stumbled upon this place on our way to fredrickburg . As soon as you enter the store, the aroma of wooden roasted ( incorrect choice of words but I just know it wood fired ) just so inviting.

Coffee Shop 62,"6 check-ins Heard about this place from friends that swear by the coffee here. After hearing about how they needed their 'moon milk fix' we wanted to come here New years day but it was closed. I came here for the first time a few days ago, I was waiting to post my review after a second visit to be sure that this deserves the five stars and ordered something different off the menu and was absolutely blown away again. I love how subtle and simple this place is. They have their secret milk recipe and leave it to that to spice up the usual cup of coffee. The first time I came here I ordered the summermoon latte, I was expecting a latte that got most of its flavor from the espresso but was pleasantly surprised with my first sip. I thought the taste was something similar to a soy caramel latte with a little something extra but a million times better. My only complaint was that it was a bit sweet and got a little hard to drink towards the bottom however I got a small and finished it within 5 minutes and wished I ordered a size bigger. I will probably be getting the half moon next time after reading some more reviews saying its not as sweet. Last night I got the espresso milkshake and i'm not sure what I was expecting but again was blown away by the taste. The shake was creamy and delicious. The consistency was easy to drink and wasn't too thick or runny. I'm not sure if they put the moon milk in the shake but the taste was completely different from the summermoon but still had that something extra that made the taste unique. It wasn't too sweet or didn't taste like it was made with tons of artificial syrups. Definitely a place worth going out of the way for and will definitely be frequenting a lot more while I'm in Austin! espresso milkshake moonmilk secret See all photos from Naomi M. for Summer Moon Coffee Bar",1
Coffee Shop 62,"Updated review Well, every time I come here lately the service and general unfriendliness seems to get worse.  Came in earlier during a very slow time and the baristas, I believe Kelly and Alexander, both doing nothing, couldn't be bothered to even acknowledge our presence as we walked up, let alone say ""hi"", ""sup"" or God forbid ""how can I help you"". The baristas at those other nearby coffee shops on S 1st say hi AND usually make me a better cup of coffee. My reasons for coming here are dwindling, and fast.  Driving to Buda isn't worth it, so maybe it's time to find a new place.  I dunno.",0
Coffee Shop 62,"Probably very good coffee. I wouldn't know though since they refuse to divulge what the 7(!) mystery ingredients are in their ""milk.""  No thanks.",0
Coffee Shop 62,I randomly decided to stop at this coffee shop on the way to pick up lunch. What a great find! The parking lot is very small and can be difficult to find a spot. The shop has a very hipster feel with lots of people drinking coffee and on their laptops or chatting it up with their friend. It was full for a Thursday late afternoon.  They advertise moon milk as a sweet and creamy blend with 7 secret ingredients. My bf and I decided to try share a 20oz half super moon drink. The half super moon is half the sweetness. I'm not are what was in it but I was delicious! Definitely a sweet and creamy blend but the half was not too sweat and perfect for the warm Austin afternoon. Half summer moon (half the sweetness),1
Coffee Shop 62,"This coffee brought me over from the dark side. I felt Luke Skywalker himself gently caress my tongue and massage my palate as I sipped on such a luxury that I have been graced to experience in my life. I got the:  Plain fire roasted coffee - I drink lots and lots of Ethiopian blends, and the coffee they had here falls in the top tier that has flowed over my tongue. An intricacy of pristine beans and a mild hint of smokiness from the fire it has been blessed with creates a deep and enchanting flavor that you won't forget with each sip that you take in order to fulfill the desire you have to consume this precious nectar.  If you like good coffee, get it. If you like the other random latte things with excessive sugar and sweetness and cakemix and whatever that you can get from starbucks, come here too (I've been told they're tasty).",1
Coffee Shop 21,"5 check-ins Delectable, wonderful, and a great addition to this area of Austin. I was so sad to hear earlier this year that the owner had passed away and that the fate of the shop was in jeopardy. However, they are open and thriving, so it seems like someone took over the shop.  For vegans (not me, but sometimes), they have an excellent selection of vegan baked goods, vegan coffee options, and vegan ice cream. I've tried most of it, and you might not ever know that it's vegan. The ice cream is particularly delicious.  The non-vegan ice cream (from a company in San Francisco) is also bomb. Particularly the brownie batter fudge! It haunts my dreams.  For the coffee lover, their menu is extensive and contains options most other shops don't have. And the employees have great expertise in their craft. Aside from the expertise, they beans they use are top notch as are all of the other ingredients - leading to some truly excellent coffee.  The parking situation in this center (Black Star, Fuzzy's, etc) is pretty terrible, so be patient and remember that the garage has multiple levels.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Service: friendly, funny, and attentive baristas!  Atmosphere: chill with a creative vibe and a everybody-knows-your-name kinda feeling.  Coffee: strong and satisfying. I asked for an extra shit of espresso in my small latte and the barista informed me that they put 2 shots standard in their small lattes. YES. Finally, a coffee shop that does it right. Bonus: a selection of syrups made in-house. Get the pumpkin!  I would've given it 5 stars, but I only went once during a trip to Austin. I'll be back, though!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I have to say this place is pretty good and they have a cute logo. Their double shot of espresso did the trick along their vegan waffles which actually tasted really good. It tasted lightweight as opposed to a non-vegan waffle. The barista will tell you the waffles will take 10 - 20 minutes to make. I had it with the coconut whipped cream and syrup. I'm pretty sure they had other toppings to offer but it was the only one that appealed to me. They had some ice cream, baked goods and waffles. You can have the waffles with ice cream, which I know is an ice cream cone but still sounds good nevertheless. Too bad it's a small place but it has a long bench against the wall with 5-6 tables. If I was living close by, I would come here more often. Vegan waffle with coconut whipped cream. Double shot espresso See all photos from Bernadette D. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert",1
Coffee Shop 21,"This place is adorable! I also appreciate the fact that they offer a lot of options as far as different types of baked goods, treats, and drinks goes. I'm not vegan but I did note that there are a lot of vegan options as well, some even looked tastier than their non-vegan counterparts.  The girls at the register were very helpful and friendly, although we had originally stopped in for coffee, the second they mentioned ice cream we had our faces pressed against the freezer glass faster than you can say fat cats. I opted for a scoop of their mint and lemon cookie, the lemon cookie is delicious and I would have dove into that freezer and ate the entire tub if they hadn't been watching.  The latte I ordered was yummy as well, I love that they create their own syrups so that you have the option of drinking a lavender flavored cup of goodness. Coffee shops take note; lavender is a win.  Thanks ladies, you're doing a great job!",1
Coffee Shop 21,Great breakfast pastries and waffles.  Everything tasted really great especially the cat sugar cookies.  Ahh the coffee was amazing and I was able to taste their cold brew although I did not purchase it.  The shop is so nice and the setup and decor is very cute.   It was not crowded and easy to find parking up front.  It will definitely be a go to place for me when in Austin and needing some caffeine not to mention yummy cookies.  I only wish they opened a little earlier in the morning but hey i don't mind waiting for them to open... By the way the staff is really nice and welcoming.  They love cats! Can't you tell.

Coffee Shop 21,"6 check-ins Well after trying a cafe cubano at several coffee places, Fat Cats has my nod as my favorite.  This was the first coffee place I tried a cubano at, thought it was good but really didn't come to appreciate how good until ordering it at several other places and finding it just didn't compare.  The flavor is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Fats cats also has ice cream, waffles, donuts and cookies to satisfy your sweet tooth craving.   The Mexican chocolate donut is one of my favorites.  If you like Mexican chocolate with a hint of spicy, this is for you. They also have great teas. Seating is fairly limited, but I've never had an issue getting a table.  Parking is plentiful which is always nice.  It always appears to be clean inside.   Fat cats is definitely in my rotation of coffee shops. Hmmm Treat yourself El Guapo Espresso See all photos from Charles Y. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I'll start with their everything doughnut. Covered in chocolate glaze and these delectable round sprinkles that interestingly enough didn't have any color, but they tasted just as good. The Doughnut, like everything in their cafe, was baked fresh that day, made from scratch with organic ingredients, and vegan. Although, I don't adhere to a lot of these dietary needs, I am always eager to try vegan to see (or should I say, taste) if I can decipher the difference. And at Fat Cats, I think they are even more delicious. The doughnut was damn good. Not too dry. Not too sweet. And too easy to eat. They have organic ice cream, Belgian waffles, and fair trade coffee to help start or sweeten your day, too!  The remainder of my experience here wasn't necessarily as enjoyable as the doughnut. It's kind of a bummer when that's the only highlight. But the service was lackluster to pretty much downright rude. Running out of something is completely expected and understandable. It's just when ordered a polite 'Sorry, we're out of Almond Milk' seems more appropriate than 'we're out' with no emotion. It's as if I was annoying the barista when asked what the wifi password was or if there were any outlets - I received two short, abrupt responses: 'What?' and 'There are no outlets' as if asking was a crime. I'm wondering if it's a coffee and dessert shop meant to encourage more social interaction than a work space, which I can understand if that was explained. It was just the exchange with the staff that left a poor taste my mouth; not the desserts. Everything doughnut",0
Coffee Shop 21,"4 check-ins HOLY CANOLI AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE..BECAUSE IT IS.  If you can't tell..I would 10/10 recommend this place. THREE WORDS: coffee ice cubes. That's right people, say goodbye to watered down iced coffee that tastes awful after 15 minutes in the Texas heat. This is revolutionary.  I am not sure how I first heard of Fat Cats but I believe they sell their vegan pastries at other places around town but it was when my friend told me about the COFFEE ICE CUBES when I got in my car and sped right there. After I picked up the iced coffee (an almond milk vanilla iced latte to be exact) I even got out of the car to run an errand and the coffee still tasted delicious instead of watered down grossness. Yum yum yum, new favorite coffee shop! And it's cat themed so right up my alley.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"What a cute place for coffee and sweets!  The espresso here was good. For ice drinks, they add ice cubes made from coffee! That's super cool! Totally unexpected to see lump of iced coffee in my iced espresso.  The dairy ice cream was also good! I was a little sad that it had a tiny bit of ice in it, but the flavor was delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"8 check-ins There's no place like Fat Cats, I love it so much. Every pastry I've had here has been amazing and their latte is heavenly, not only because it has coffee ice cubes, but because of how smooth it is. I've had a couple of their daily teas as well which were also good. The ladies who work there are awesome and always very helpful. I only wish it was closer to where I live so I could go there everyday.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"They don't actually have cats here, bummer...but the decor is super cute.  This is a comprehensive coffee/sweet tooth spot! They offer gf ice cream cones (sugar and regular cones) and a variety of gf cookies.  I got the gf chocolate chip and almond milk chai. The chai takes a few minutes to make since they brew to order.  It was pretty good but was a little heavy on the cinnamon and ginger side for my liking. The gf cookie though!  Yummy!  Just the right amount of chocolate chips and chewy, my fav quality.

Coffee Shop 21,"I really like this place. Although pricey, the quality makes it worth every penny.    There are plenty of organic coffee/espresso/tea options for whatever you happen to be in the mood for, be it a standard black coffee, a latte, macchiato, cafe au lait, or a variety of brewed teas, they make it! They also have a variety of different syrups made in-house that can be added to any brew.  There are also a variety of desserts available to satisfy any sweet tooth. These range from cookies and donuts to mini pies and ice cream (both dairy and vegan versions). I've had a few of their ice creams (both versions) and have loved every flavor I've tried. You can also ask for a spoonful to try if you can't decide!  The atmosphere is cozy, the wifi satisfactory and the employees are super nice. Great place to visit!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I love Fat Cats.  I work way too close to it so I must exercise some restraint.  I admit I haven't had much of the food there. I typically have tea, of which they have an incredible variety, or an almond milk latte which is always made with care and served in a nice big mug. On a particularly hot day I enjoyed an Italian soda which they were kind enough to make less sweet for me because I'm a big baby with stuff that's too sweet.  The servers/baristas are both kind and knowledgeable. Especially with tea. When I stare blankly at their impressive menu they are quick to help with welcome suggestions. It's wonderful that they have so many allergen and vegan-diet friendly options and that they do their best to offer organic items. Wish more places would follow in their footsteps with those initiatives.  Get a punch card!  One thing I wish they would re-consider or invest in if the opportunity comes would be wall outlets and comfier seating. I would love to hang out here and study/work/read. I'd be motivated (for better or worse) to purchase more stuff there because you can't sit in front of all those treats for very long without convincing yourself you need one.  I'm not deducting a star because the point of the layout may indeed have been to discourage people staying around. I have worked in food establishments where we preferred to push people out after a bit. But, I think the beauty of coffee shops is that it can be a place to get away from home and hang for a bit, so I'd certainly do that at Fat Cats if it were an option.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"2 check-ins Some of the best baked goods in Austin can be found at Fat Cats. Their vegan doughnut offerings are tasty, perfectly executed, and always leave me wanting more. Also, try their one-of-kind vegan cinnamon rolls baked fresh on Saturday mornings. The c-rolls will be the highlight of your weekend! Pumpkin Spice Doughnuts + Fresh out of the oven Cinnamon Rolls. Vegan!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"One of my favorite go to spots !!! I'm a huge fan of coffee and healthy stuff!!! So it's the perfect combination, and the prices are reasonable. The cool thing about this place that it has a lot of vegan items.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"4 check-ins Fat Cats is right down the street from my house, so I've found myself here a few times. They make a great traditional chai (warning: it takes about 10 minutes). The place is cute, and every time I go they're adding more to the atmosphere. There are always a few folks seated; working and enjoying coffee.  Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the coffee they brew - the flavor seems off for me. (I'm one of those horrible people that likes the Starbucks flavor). But where they get me are the baked goods (most/all are vegan I believe). I had no idea magic could be made without butter and eggs - and I went to school for it!!  But really, they do a fantastic job.  Stop by, enjoy a chai and a loaf for one.  Leave one for me.",1
Coffee Shop 21,Was waiting for my hair appointment couple doors down so stopped in for some coffee. Cute little place that serves up natural ingredients and they have a small selection of baked goods.  All your typical morning drink fixes hot/cold with variety of milk choices dairy and non dairy (almond etc).  Clean establishment and has several tables to give our foot a rest! Many options,1
Coffee Shop 21,"What I had: - Drink: Cubano con Leche: I liked it! - Food: Mexican Chocolate Donut - it was good, but I'm not a terribly big fan of baked, cake donuts. It wasn't too cakey and light; it was denser, but meh, I don't think I'd be that excited to try another here.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"There was so much on the menu that I didn't get to try, but I'll be returning.  I had some ice cream (of the dairy variety - they offered vegan options as well) and it was luscious.  I also tried some of the iced tea and it was refreshing.  I loved that there were dog treats along with many human treats to choose from.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the atomosphere nice and quiet.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Just moved near this location so I had to check it out. And I'm glad I did!  Now, I could never be vegan (I love all types of food waaaay too much), but this place had me thinking I could change my ways. Everything in their display case looked delicious and all of it was either gluten free, vegan, or organic. They also have vegan icecream! So, if you qualify as one of those things check this place out for the desserts  Let's move onto the coffee! My iced coffee was probably one of the best I've had in this city. It was delicious and I was able to get it with soy (any type of milk you could possibly think of, I would bet they have) for free of charge. Also they make their own sweeteners which are also organic and delicious. The coolest part of my iced coffee was that they used ice cubes that are made out of frozen coffee (genius idea. why don't more places do this??) so the coffee flavor was not watered down at all. Also, a nice bonus was that after finishing my drink I let the ice cubes melt and had a second iced coffee. It was like getting a free refill which made my cheap self very excited.  The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is due to their latte.  We ordered the pumpkin spice latte (#basic #fall) and it was not as amazing as my iced coffee. There was a lot of foam and the pumpkin spice flavor was a little lackluster.  However, living in Texas, it's pretty much warm year round so I don't need hot drinks to make me sweat even more than I do. I'll stick to the iced coffee here and be the happiest and most caffeinated person in the world.  Definitely try this place out! Coffee ice cubes are put in the iced coffee to ensure the drink doesn't get watered down!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I have only been here once. I will be here more often in the future.  So the name ""Fat Cats"" is cool in and of itself! Check out the fat orange cat in my profile pic. I need to try the coffee but went for some ice cream. Brownie Batter, Mexican Chocolate Chip and Raspberry Chip(i think) they were delicious. It was like 6 bucks. The service was quick. Then again, there were 2 girls behind the counter and only a couple other patrons there. The wifi was fast.  Loses one star. Why? Not a lot of outlets to plug your stuff into. Seats are hardwood benches that hurt my butt. Parking may be issue, this particular time of day it was not. Its in Midtown Commons, a place where people pay a fortune to live in a tight, overcrowded space.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Pretty adorable little spot in an albeit unsuspecting location. We stopped here the other night for some vegan ice cream after dinner. I was glad that the lady was willing to provide a few samples for me since I hadn't been there before. I ordered from the vegan side, which is all Coconut Bliss coconut milk ice cream. Ordered a half and half scoop, which was awesome, since I didn't want to do two scoops just to get two flavors. Not all places are that accommodating.  They'd already put the baked goods away, which seems like poor business to me. My brother, who goes frequently, said that's common practice for them to empty out the bakery case hours before closing. The woman said if there was anything we wanted, she could get it from the back, but it's hard to know what I want if I can't see it: the texture, the size, the potential for deliciousness entreating me to spend more money. I hope they'll reconsider this practice in the future.  Also of note: loyalty cards. My brother got a punch for each of us, and I got mint chocolate chip. Score.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I happened by Fat Cats after a work lunch at Blackstar, and was feeling caffeineedy. I got a run of the mill iced latte with almond milk. The coffee is fantastic (I noticed that there is a daily roast card, and that they were out of some beans which is a plus in my book) and I was very pleased with how quickly it was made. It's also VERY reasonably priced.  On a whim, I decided to have it iced, and I am very glad I did. The ice is made with coffee instead of water. I'm thrilled! I am so excited this little cup is going to last me for more than the 30 minutes it would normally take to nurse it a little.  The reason it's a four instead of five star is because I like my coffee shops to feel a little less like frozen yogurt places (bright and sterile), more like a friend's house.  Excellent job, Fat Cats. I will make it a point to come back for dessert when I'm in less of a rush and will update my review!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Tasty drinks and pastries, but lacking good service and a comforting coffee shop ambience.  Had two of their baked donuts, and they were both full of flavor and the texture was light and spongy. The Mexican chocolate donut featured dark chocolate and subtle notes of cinnamon and chili pepper. The mocha donut was sweeter, yet well balanced by hints of coffee.  Overall, the store could benefit from some art on the walls and louder music to make the space feel less jarring. Mexican Chocolate (front) and Mocha baked donuts",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I was in the area and noticed the new coffee shop so dropped by. The barrista was pretty friendly. I grabbed a chai and I have to say, had to be one of the best chai lattes I ever had. Their baked goods were great too. Got a cowboy cookie, was pretty awesome.  It's right by Black Star Coop which is a plus. Go there for a meal and beer, then retire to Fat Cats for some dessert and coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"12 check-ins There's only a few other places in Austin that advertise making a café Cubano espresso, but I have to say this is my favorite one. I'm so happy I found this place... It is near my house and they make my favorite drink, like I said before café Cubano. The establishment is small and intimate but perfect for a guy like me. I sometimes will do work on my laptop here or just come to hang out with friends. They also have really good treats like pastries gluten-free cookies and fair trade ice cream's. The coffee is organic and totally worth it. Cafe Cubano Cafe Cubano Cafe cubano See all photos from Christian L. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Date night win!  We tried the banana nut loaf, decaf americanos, and the Mexican chocolate doughnut. -The banana nut bread was a *little* bit dry but very tasty, not-too-sweet, with really rich chocolate chips.   -The coffee was FANTASTIC.  Couldn't believe it was decaf.  (Also, awesome: it was about the same price as Starbucks, if not cheaper.  Hard to find great coffee for that price.) -For us, the highlight was the Mexican chocolate doughnut in combination with the coffee.  We both like spicy foods with our coffee so this was just right.  Like the bread, it wasn't too sweet but was SO perfectly chocolatey with a nice spiciness from cayenne pepper.  I'll be back for this! (Keep in mind, that if you like a traditional doughnut, this might not be for you.  It's more like a super-moist cake, not fried and fluffy like a regular doughnut.)",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I've been to this place in previous months and was met with friendly and prompt service each visit. Today was first time I've been there in the about 3 weeks and I had just received the worst service I've ever received...ANYWHERE. I, unlike many new faces in the cafe, was able to ramble off my Cafe con Leche order like a pro without any hesitation. Alright cool...I got a Matcha Donut...she gave it to me...cool. Then, I paid the $10 for my stuff, put my $2 in the tip jar then proceeded to have a seat and wait for my beverage. Come to see, when I sit down, the angsty-looking chick who took my order comes from behind the counter, takes a seat where patrons sit and starts browsing her cell phone.  At this point there is one other lady behind the counter who is preoccupied in what looks like stocking and prepping. My drink is not being made. I work as a barista so I can tell when a drink is or is not being made. I'm the only customer in the shop so...why isn't my drink being made???  After about 5 min of still not hearing an espresso machine or a milk steamer I stand up at the pick-up counter to get some attention. The chick who took my order is still sitting, browsing her phone. The lady behind the counter greets me and tries to usher me towards the register because she doesn't know that I ordered a drink already. I tell her that I had ordered one already and had to tell her what I had ordered. Now, its not her fault for not knowing because she didn't take my order. Like I said, this cafe was dead so there is no reason for miscommunication unless it was purposeful negligence on her co-workers behalf.  I'm a regular even though I have an espresso machine. I like helping out local businesses and I also love hand crafted drinks I can't quite perfect at home. I'm sort of afraid to go back and pay as much as I did just to be treated with such disrespect.  If I do go back I'll request someone other than the angsty chick to take my order and I'll tip after I'm served.  Emily was helpful, prompt and understanding.",0
Coffee Shop 21,"I love the desserts, coffee (they use Third Coast!) and atmosphere of this place.  That said, they've lost my business completely.  The first time we visited, I was really disappointed that there were no outlets to set up shop and work for a few hours.  My fiance ended up dragging a table and chair to the one outlet between the banquet seating and the bathroom to charge his computer when it got close to dying - a workable, if inelegant, solution.  Now, upon returning, they have added a lockbox to the outlet to prevent customer use.  There are plenty of coffee shops around town who want this kind of business - but it's clear Fat Cats doesn't.  Too bad, because they were well on their way to being our favorite coffee shop on the north side.",0
Coffee Shop 21,"At long last, a coffee shop in my neighborhood. And even better yet, one that is vegan-friendly! Fat Cat's pays attention to detail. Their coffee is Fair Trade. Iced coffee is a delicious cold brew and served with coffee ice cubes so it won't get watered down! Genius! Milk is from grass fed cows, or any kind of nondairy. Coffee syrups are home made.  I didn't get to try their baked goods because their oven was broken but I hear they will all be vegan.  They have a deluxe ice cream menu featuring 8 or 10 flavors each of vegan and dairy ice creams. The vegan ice cream is Coconut Bliss brand, not sure where they get the dairy version. They have organic toppings like vegan gummy bears and marshmallows. They even have a nondairy hot fudge and coconut whipped cream.  My only complaint is that the hot fudge serving is a bit skimpy. I went back and paid for a second serving to make it come out with my ice cream.  That may be a cost control issue, as it's clearly made with high quality chocolate.",1
Coffee Shop 21,Their store is super cute. There's a good selection of different drinks on the menu and they also have ice cream (score!). There are vegan friendly options and everything is environmentally friendly. Traditions drip coffee!,1
Coffee Shop 21,Freshly made organic coffee . Fresh. Tasty. Excellent place for the coffee and bakes. Clean and good hospitality. Thanx,1
Coffee Shop 21,"This is a very nice coffee shop that is a good place to study/work and grab some organic/vegan snacks.  Things to know:  Pros - Good selection of vegan and non-dairy ice creams, as well as traditional ice cream. - Nice pastry/bakery options for vegans as well -  Square tables good for doing work at - Coffee is pretty good - Great selection of teas, which are also good - Super cute environment - parking directly outside storefront (2Hr spots)  Cons - no outlets for plugging in computers. (no biggie. Just charge your stuff before you come) - Small store, so could potentially get crowded easily. (It was not crowded when I went on a weekday afternoon) - Bench seating makes up half the seating of every table, as the bench and tables line one wall of the place. I didn't mind it because it wasn't busy, but you might end up smooshed up next to someone on a busy day.  What I got:  Matcha vegan baked donut: I actually really liked the donut. It was spiced really well and very moist. Very cake-like. The matcha is in the icing, which does have a good matcha flavor, but is also very, very sweet. It was too sweet for me to finish the donut. But if you love super-sweet icing you'll probably like the donut overall.  Latte with almond milk. Really good. Very strong dark roast flavor.  Scoop of Vegan Ginger cookie ice cream and scoop of regular Cardamom flavor ice cream. both were delicious!  Sun, Moon, and Stars iced green tea. Very pleasant.  And I just loved seeing all the little touches in decor like the black bowler hat light shades.  Overall, I really liked it there. The night manager, Ariel, was tending the place the afternoon that I went and she was very nice and personable.  I'll definitely be going back. The bar to the left of the ice creams. Matcha Donut. Great matcha flavor in the icing, but too sweet for me. The donut itself is moist, cakey, and yummy. See all photos from Sarah S. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert",1
Coffee Shop 21,This place is super convenient and REALLY tasty. They have a lot of vegan options for desserts and coffee options. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the taste of coffee. I would say their Mocha's are the best I've ever had.  I have tried their banana bread and vegan Chocolate chip cookies that are to die for. Please treat yourself. The staff is super friendly!,1
Coffee Shop 21,"This place is awesome, my coffee was delicious and staff really friendly and helpful when I had questions. Iced soy caramel coffee was delicious",1
Coffee Shop 21,Beautiful place! Great service! The coffee is a bit bitter than most but good. Tasty cookies! Love the lamps!!!! Cute place!!,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Here's my suggestion on a fun way you downtown folk or you Cedar Park folk can spend your Saturday:  Hop on the MetroRail and exit Crestview. Go to Black Star for beers. Then walk a few steps to Fat Cats for delicious baked goods, coffee, ice cream, whatever.  VEGANS! You must check this place out!",1
Coffee Shop 21,For a good coffee shop you need a few things.  1. High quality beans 2. High quality baristas 3. Noms 4. Atmosphere 5. Proximity to customers  This place excels on all points. Their use of coffee ice cubes is an excellent touch. Oh and not to mention they're vegan and have delicious pastries! ( referenced as noms above ),1
Coffee Shop 21,"First to Review My wife and I saw that this place was opening today so we took the train from round rock and went to check it out. We were not disappointed! The first thing you notice is the Decor. Beautifully decorated with a great color scheme, cool light fixtures and an amazing counter top with refurbished wood!! The second thing you notice is warm smiles from a friendly staff ready to serve. The last and most important thing is tasty food (waffle w Choc chips in my case) and drinks! (My wife got a decaf cubano and I got a double espresso from third coast and a delicious Carmel latte w homemade syrup) Highly recommend this place!!! I love these counters!!! Beautiful milk and sugar station See all photos from Brian B. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert",1
Coffee Shop 21,Frozen Coffee Ice Cubes in the Iced Coffee. Amazing.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Stopped in tonight with my fingers crossed looking for a dessert waffle, and Fat Cats blew me away. Got a Belgian Waffle with 1 scoop Sea Salted Caramel Ice Cream and 1 scoop Butterscotch Pecan Ice Cream. The shop prides itself in having vegan and gluten-free items, which didn't really matter to me but others would appreciate. The waffle was great, it had a hint of cinnamon which really added to the flavor. The waffle was nicely crisp on the outside to hold onto and balance the ice cream, with an airy and fluffy inside. The ice cream was delicious (the flavors we got were made with dairy but they do offer dairy-free kinds) and really went well with the waffle.  My girlfriend and I are going to return at some point to try out the teas and such now that we know the waffles are so delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Meh. Good service and pretty decent coffee but came here on a Sunday at 9-ish (not long after they open) and they had run out of breakfast pastries - just cookies and heavier desserts left. I love me a good cookie but not when it's my only option first thing in the morning.....sorry Fat Cats. Cute decor and such potential but when there are so many good coffee spots that also give me the chance to grab breakfast while I'm there, can't really see myself comin back here.",0
Coffee Shop 21,First time here. This is how I see it: This is the best tasting caramel Latte I've ever had. She blended it with the hands of an artist that makes it so good. I will come back.  I think the business owners are using the space they have all wrong. They seem to have given more space to the baristas than they have to the guests. So they certainly need more seating. Other than that touché Fat Cat.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Great coffee and desserts. The tiny (real size) espressos are awesome, and the ice cream and chocolate chip cookies are excellent. Fun place to wind up a night out after Black Star. Staff was super nice and helpful.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I've dropped in a couple of times to Fat Cats and the place is great!  I'm mostly there for the pastry's so I'll try different ones when I come in.  I recommend their scones!  I also enjoyed their traditional Chai Tea; it was delicious, full of flavor, and overall amazing.  Come by and support your local cafe!  Austin is a tough place to thrive for small business, and we definitely want this wonderful local coffee shop to stick around for a long time!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Very good coffee!!! Love that they support vegan and vegetarian lifestyles too :) adorable place with a really good selection of homemade, locally sourced products.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"This is a cute and quaint little coffee shop tucked away near St. John's Ave and Lamar.  They have a nice tea selection and also have a variety of ice cream, and they even have vegan ice cream- made with Coconut Milk! Glad that I stumbled upon this gem.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Happy to have this place in the neighborhood! Really friendly staff, good coffee and great ice cream. I had one scoop of dairy ice cream and one scoop of vegan and they were both rich, creamy and flavorful. Huge fan of the coffee ice cubes for cold drinks.",1
Coffee Shop 21,I got the coffee float with chocolate ice cream and it was wonderful! The Mexican chocolate doughnut was moist and spicy which was surprising and delightful. I can't wait to try more here.,1
Coffee Shop 21,Hard to find but its pretty nice with unique flavors,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Really happy with the service and quality. I come here pretty regularly, and the coffee is well made, the iced coffee cubes are genius. The baked goods and ice cream are lovely. I adore the drinking chocolate as well (ladies, if you're having an insatiable hormone driven chococraving this is the cure).  Definitely recommended.  I'm hoping they'll start doing custom cakes soon, as I have a wedding coming up.  ;)",1
Coffee Shop 21,"4 check-ins Such a sweet lil bakery Fat Cats is! They always have an above average variety of treats in the bakery case, and the coffee does not disappoint! They have vegan Belgian waffles and many flavors of non-dairy ice cream, both of which I am looking forward to trying (after which I will update my review)!! The baristas have been nothing but super pleasant too. Fat Cats hosts the perfect atmosphere for some Joe, a treat, and gossip with a friend!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"very good iced mocha and iced cafe con leche. You'd think Austin would have more cafes that serve organic coffee, etc. fortunately, the one we found is good and not just marketing.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"This place was awesome. We went for the baked donuts and because their baked goods are vegan. They were out of most bakery items but keep in mind we went late in the evening.  We had cafe con leche, mexican snickerdoodle cookies and scones. Yum! The cafe was not true cuban coffee atleast not like I had in Miami. But it was still great coffee. The service was slow but very courteous and professional.  There was only one person working and seemed like everyone decided to all come at once.  The coffee is made to order so it does take longer but definitely worth the wait!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"i find that a cafe that serves a macchiato in the true way (espresso+foam) deserves a 3 stars on its own. barista was really attentive. tried the mexican chocolate donut, really nice and spiced very good addition to my macchiato. my friend got the mocha and get this, the ice is made from coffee! nice touch there guys, really loving the flavor profile of the mocha here. they got ice cream as well, both vegan and non-vegan. would come here again.",1
Coffee Shop 21,I came here to get some ice cream. I had chocolate and peanut butter. It was really good! I want to come back and try their coffee sometimes. The environment looks fun here. Almost everything is organic here. They have vegan ice cream options too. I tried a sample of it but I'm not used to the taste. People who eat vegan ice creams should come here. They have 11 different flavors to pick from.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Listed in Yummy in my Tummy I dropped my boyfriend off at the barber shop and was craving coffee. Yelp told me this was the closest coffee shop so I decided to give it a try. It was a little confusing to find the shop due to the location and parking is very minimal, but I made my second loop around and caught a car leaving and waited for their spot. When I walked in, I was the only customer there. I was assisted by a super friendly employee who gave me honest feedback on the dog treats instead of just trying to sell to me (I asked if they were hard since my dog refuses to eat hard dog treats and she said they are). I got two donuts (my sweet tooth was bigger than my stomach) and an iced caramel latte. Excuse my french, but it was all SEX IN MY MOUTH. I honestly think it was the best coffee drink I've ever had - and they even offer coffee ice cubes for iced drinks. I only ate one of the donuts but the sweet lady was nice enough to give me a to go box for the other one. I actually cried over the other donut cause my boyfriend ate it :'( DONUT JUDGE ME, they were that good!  The only thing I didn't like was that there was no outside seating, and the inside seating was kind of awkward. I was there by myself and the only customer there at the time, so I would've liked to sit outside. Best coffee I've had yet.",1
Coffee Shop 21,A friend and I were looking for a place to get our coffee fix.  There are a lot of cute details inside.  I really appreciated the coffee ice cubes that came in my cold brew!   I thought the coffee was a good strength as well.  I would come back to this cafe.,1
Coffee Shop 21,I had their Affagato. Fat Cats' espresso was had the right amount of bitter and sourness that made their Fair Trade Vanilla Bean ice cream the best combination. Good coffee and good values in the coffee and sweets industry. Fair trade and vegan options.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Excellent selection of vegan treats!  I am impressed with the ingredients and variety. Enjoyed a large mug of coffee and vegan muffin.  Perhaps not the most comfortable seating, but pleasant atmosphere and free wifi. I will definitely be coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 21,This place is a vegan's paradise! All of their pastries are vegan and they also offer vegan ice cream! The girls who work here are super sweet. It's a really cute place! I will be back to try their donuts. I only wish they had more outlets to plug in my laptop. Come with your computer fully charged!,1
Coffee Shop 21,The best dessert place I have ever had in Austin. Do try!! I really love blueberry pie. Its awesome!,1
Coffee Shop 21,The Traditional Chai Tea is AMAZING! It takes about 5 minutes but it's so worth it.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"I do a lot of research from home, so I'm usually on the lookout for a close by coffee shop. Thank goodness for Fat Cats! I go in with my laptop fully charged, knowing that I'll also find some delicious dairy-free breakfast options (if you haven't tried it yet, I *highly* recommend the Mexican chocolate donut!). They were even super helpful at crafting a delicious green tea with mint and honey for me when I was indecisive about what kind of drink I was looking for. Overall, I love love love this place. The only heads up I would give is that they do not have multiple outlets, so this would not be ideal for an all-day study place... but excellent if, like me, you sometimes want to keep yourself from working too much or make yourself take a break once your laptop battery is drained. :)",1
Coffee Shop 21,One of the best cappuccino's I have had in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 21,Wonderful customer service. Unique character in the decorating. I love it! The coffee is delicious n the pastries worth the extra calories. Go local!!!,1
Coffee Shop 21,"Fat Cats has the neatest drink! ""Drinking Chocolate"" is like an espresso version of hot chocolate. The coconut milk ice cream is really rich and tasty. The vanilla and chocolate have a lot of flavor and I would get them again. My husband and I would go back as the ice cream and chocolate is great!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Love it! A fresh, new coffee shop in the hood!  We have yet to try the coffee, but went in post-dinner to try the ice cream. YUM. Better than Lick and many more options. They had so much vegan and gluten free stuff, I feel like anyone could come here and find something that they can eat and enjoy.  Can't wait to go back for coffee and other yummy treats!",1
Coffee Shop 21,Stopped by here  while on a work trip and got a hot chocolate. I don't do regular dairy and they were really accommodating - offered multiple alternatives. The result was delicious! It was just enough sweet and just enough rich. The ice cream selection looked fantastic  and I wish I could have indulged in it! The atmosphere was conducive for conversations with friends or to just do work. Wish there was a place like this near where I live!,1
Coffee Shop 21,I love this place! I'm not vegan but love their ice creams. The vanilla is perfect for the best affagato I've ever had. The ambiance is wonderful and the staff is really accommodating. The have a great variety of sweet treats and new items daily.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"I absolutely love there iced lattes are to die for!! Not only do they have ""coffee ice cubes"" but I was able to get it made with almond milk since dairy isn't for me. I love how it never got watered down or bland. You have got to try their pastry's. My sister and I got several over the course of 3 days since she lives upstairs and I was visiting from California. It was amazing and the customer service was excellent and fast. I love how the restaurant was clean and inviting! Thank you for a great time!",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Pretty obsessed with this place.  Their coffee & espresso drinks are dreamy. Each time we stop in, there's a case full of amazing baked goods and pastries. Everything is so. freaking. good!  Plus it's mostly organic and it isn't expensive at all. You can have vegan affogato, waffles topped with ice cream, warm cookies, muffins, a latte float, coffee and cinnamon rolls - literally hundreds of possibilities here.",1
Coffee Shop 21,This place is relatively new but it is awesome! Friendly service and delicious treats with high-quality ingredients. I love their non-dairy ice cream options. I haven't tried their coffee yet but I'll definitely be back. The prices are also more affordable than I would expect from a place like this.,1
Coffee Shop 21,"I come in every morning for a latte and a conversation.  Be patient.  They just opened and a lot of their staff are new.  Your patience is rewarded with home-baked scones and muffins, home-made ice cream toppings and home-made waffle cones.  All of it is organic.  All of it served by friendly staff with a smile.  They have loyalty cards; get one because you will need it.  They have plenty of ice cream flavours and give out free samples if you ask.  Some flavours are vegan-friendly.  The music isn't too loud and they have some fantastic decor.  Attention to detail in this regard is spectacular.  By using Third Coast Coffee Roaster's beans Fat Cats is supporting a local business.  They have free wifi; use it to write a Yelp review.  I wish this local business the best for the future.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Love this place. Since red rabbit bakery closed up shop there's been a void that has now been filled. If you aren't sure what to try just pick anything, can't go wrong. Cinnamon rolls are awesome, great coffee, donuts are delicious. It's a quick bite type of place to fill that sweet tooth. Can't wait to try the waffles next time.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I love this place! The baked vegan donuts are delicious and have a great texture. The coffee is the best that I've had in this city to date. My favorite part, however, is the tea menu. They have a wide selection of teas that can be ordered by the cup or pot. I've been to plenty of coffee shops where they simply put a tea bag in hot water which is so wrong! Not here! They take the time to make a proper pot of tea with the correct temperatures and time for the type of tea. Finally! An affordable pot of tea made properly. I'm in heaven. The place is clean, bright, and quiet. If I lived closer I would visit daily, but I am happy that I can go in the weekends. I plan to try the waffles and ice cream next. Happy to see more delicious vegan options in this city.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"Great food and drinks! Thanks do much for the vegan options. I was a little disappointed by the location, though. Also, the barista seemed out of it - poor attention secondary to I don't know what.",1
Coffee Shop 21,Thank you for offering Vegan and Organic treats :) I loved the Ginger lemon scone. I'll definitely be back to try the ice cream and the waffles. I'll also make sure to come earlier in the day (came close to 9 pm) to try some of the treats that were sold out then.  Great service too!!!,1
Coffee Shop 21,"I have come here twice now for my morning coffee and have enjoyed it. This place also offers vegan and gluten free options bakery items and as a non vegan I was very skeptical of their vegan blueberry coffee crumb muffin, but I was hungry. I was pleasantly surprised by the muffin and would come back and order it anytime.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"My new favorite coffee shop! Love the atmosphere, drinks and staff. Everyone is super friendly and happy to make recommendations... Even early in the morning. ;)",1

Coffee Shop 21,"Worst brownie I have ever eaten, it was like bitting a big chunk of oil, leaving a disgusting aftertaste.",0
Coffee Shop 21,"Excellent little shop with excellent assortment of coffee/tea, pastries, and more importantly ice-cream.  This is the adult version of the Baskin Robbins that was so popular as a kid.  The only reason why I didn't give it more stars was the limited seating and lack of outlets.  This could be due to the fact that the free parking is limited to two hours, however the quality of the food/drink offerings would attract customers willing to stay here and consume things all afternoon.  I'll definitely be coming back to get work done and have another cherry pie a la mode.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"It really is a relief to finally have a coffee shop in this neighborhood. The fact that it makes a large variety of delicious ice creams (some vegan, some not) is icing on a wonderful cake.",1
Coffee Shop 21,"I have seen them working on this place and was waiting with anticipation for its opening.  It is absolutely gorgeous on the inside with lots of natural light and pretty decor.  I ordered the traditional indian chai and it was great.  Not only did they have non dairy options (soy,almond AND coconut), the owner who took my order also recommended the one that would taste the best.  I am a little bit of a chai snob and can't handle the powders or concentrated mixes that you find at most places around town.  This is the real deal.  I can't wait to go back for some dessert!",1
Coffee Shop 21,Made better cappuccino myself - really disappointing.  It was a Saturday so maybe the normal staff wasn't in.,0
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in 2016 Yelp 100, The Sweet Spots!, Coffee Shops with Latte Art 24/7 coffee shop that offers great coffee, spacious and plenty of seating option, along with yummy snack bites!!! Why can't we have something like this in DFW already??? Maybe they're not ready for people like me who would definitely ""camp"" out over night at their coffee shop if there was one in Dallas :(  After our late dinner, I wanted something sweet, surprise, not. Checking out at least couple new coffee shops while in Austin was also on my to do list. Epoch was only about 10mins from where we were at, and stays open 24/7 made it the perfect pick.  It took us a few minutes looking for a parking spot in their small lot. We gave up and decided to park on the street, ur best option. The coffee shop was packed at almost 11pm on a Thursday night, not too big of a surprise since it's not far from UT, swamped with night owls was completely understandable.  We each got a hazelnut latte. I was a lil disappointed to see somewhat of crappy latte art on both, but the delicious, smooth latte made up for it, along with their delicious strawberry rhubarb pie, making my first experience with rhubarb pie a great one.  We would have stayed here longer if the mosquitoes didn't like me too much and started munching on me. First coffee shop on my list for this Austin trip was a win and a success in my book, regardless of the disappointing latte art, I'm definitely looking forward to the next time coming back here! Strawberry rhubarb pie. So good! Hazelnut latte. No real latte art :( Hazelnut latte with almond milk. Great coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Nothing like retreating to the bathroom to cry after the worst coffee shop experience of all time...  I was having a rough morning yesterday, so my roommate and I decided to try Epoch and have a calm, chill Saturday morning coffee sit. After waiting 10-15 minutes in line, we get to the front. Roommate orders a Rosemary salt bagel and a coffee, pays, then goes to find a table. Then I walk up and order a Rosemary salt bagel as well, and a chai latte with a shot of espresso. The barista (shortish with dreadlocks) stares down at the tablet and ignores me. He looks up and loudly yells in front of the whole restaurant ""yo! Salt bagel people get back here I need to ring you up!"" Since my roommate just paid and I'm just standing there, I assume he's talking about customers from a few minutes ago that were ahead of us in line. ""DUDE! Those people just walked off. GUYS I NEED TO RING YOU UP!"" My roommate comes back to the counter and is like ""What's going on?"" He then says ""Where's your little friend? I need to ring her up."" She looks at me (again, I am standing right in front of the counter trying to order). ""Ummm.. She's right there."" The idiot barista looks at me and says ""oh I thought you walked away."" I AM STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES. ""you're invisible I guess."" He says. Awesome. Then he asks me AGAIN. What I'd like to order even though I already said it twice.  I get my chai and it is absolutely the worst I've ever had. Lukewarm and it tasted like basil? Completely lazy. We had asked for butter with our bagels, we got burnt bagels with cream cheese. After a rough morning, being told you're invisible, and an entirely screwed up order, I just lost it. Worst experience I've ever had at a coffee shop. Will never, ever return to Epoch.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"39 check-ins ROTD My husband and I moved to the North Loop neighborhood about three weeks ago. And that's  when our love story with Epoch Coffee began. The first time our lips sipped on that coffee, we knew it wasn't just infatuation; it was meant to be, baby!  Epoch Coffee is a quiet but cozy coffee shop open 24/7 (a dream come true if like us you like to stay up late!) They serve great espresso, latte, a killer mocha, soda, tea, delicious pies, pastries, bagels and East Side Pies pizza slices.  They have a large indoor and outdoor space, free wi-fi access and lots of tables and chairs for all. Many people visit Epoch Coffee night and day to work or study on their laptops while sipping on a flavorful espresso. My husband and I usually go there to chitchat and relax, which seems to be counter-current to the local working-hard-with-my-coffee culture, but we feel welcome in the space nonetheless.  I honestly have nothing negative to say about Epoch! The cafe and the restrooms are clean, the staff is nice, they're always open, and the food and drinks are good. What more could I possibly ask for? I'm sold! Coffee shop interior Epoch Coffee facade lit up at night",1
Coffee Shop 20,"2 check-ins Epoch has it all.. Good coffee, chilled vibe & a variety of characters frequenting the shop.. & the location is a true reflection of an Austin coffee shop.. UT kids scattered across all tables, chairs & bar stools.. WiFi (inside/outside) & a bunch of mismatched furniture which makes it perfectly comfy like a friend's living room..!!!  I love that the place is 24x7, makes it the perfect place to go to get some creative work done.. Any given time of the day..!!  The music is very lively & a mix of anything & everything.. Never a dull moment.. Great for people watching if you want to take a break..!!!  I definitely love to come here not just for the coffee.. But the ambience..!! Keep the lights ON..!!! And keep Austin weird. My Joe..now let's get those creative juices to kick in..!!",1
Coffee Shop 20,Cool neighborhood feel coffee shop.  I wish the location close to me (Anderson Lane) had the same vibe.  Cortado por favor.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins Nothing can beat a 24/7 coffee shop. Come here once in a while if I need to get stuff done at night or over night. Epoch is spacious and filled with werid interesting/vintage decors. Two different patios with very solid wifi.  One downside about this place is their music selection. Hip hop music? I don't think so....otherwise, this place is perfect if you want to sit down for a cup of coffee and get things done.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This is one of the best coffee places in Austin.. And to top it off, it's open 24x7.. The service is great and the ambience is fantastic.. I love the Iced Mojo and my wife likes the Turkish mint tea.. We usually sit outdoors as we take Sunny, our yellow lab with us.. He meets a few doggy as well as human friends everytime we visit. There are electrical connections on each and every table which makes it convenient, wherever you sit.. Lots of parking and a great location.. Visit anytime!! Ambience, company and great coffee!!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This is a gem in Austin. It looks okay from the outside, but the inside has a really cool/chill ambiance.  It seems like everyone that goes there has a purpose... to be out of their house, get good coffee, or are studying.  Pizza is ehhh, but the coffee, snacks and desserts are on point.  Oh, and they have a lot of tables/seats available, have outlets available throughout the cafe and operate 24/7.  Customer service is great and they are extremely friendly.  Probably my favorite coffeehouse in all of Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"12 check-ins One of my favorite coffee shops right now.  The horchata coffee hits the spot with the hot summer weather.  They also have a great Mexican mocha, iced or hot.  There is not usually any problems finding parking out front.  There is plenty of seating inside.  They serve east side pies as well as some pastry items like brownies and banana but loaf.  The service is very quick.  Best of all they are open 24 hours so you never have to worry that they might be closed which is one of my pet peeves about other coffee shops in town.  Prices are pretty comparable with most other coffee shops in town. Anniversary Party! Display case",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This is the best coffee spot in Austin. It's got that hipster, Mac computer, indie music vibe that lets you know the coffee is gonna be on point even before you get to the register. I really enjoyed my mocha with double chocolate. My husband who is more of a French press kind of guy wished he would have gotten an extra shot of espresso in his but we really loved this place. Highly recommend it! Delicious mocha with a touch of cinnamon. Indoor and outdoor seating with all you can surf wifi",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Epoch is a cozy and comfortable hipster coffee shop. If you want that environment, good wifi, lots of outlets, a choice of tables/couches/outside patios, and a place to work all night, definitely come here. It's a nice getaway. Sure, I wish the food was more affordable and they got comfier seats, but at least the almond egg salad sandwich is the yummy sunshine of a vegetarians day (all nighter)! A study corner",1
Coffee Shop 20,"When I'm in the area, I like popping into here.  Their coffee is delicious - I usually have a latte or cappuccino.  Tons of seating and free wifi.  There's an outside patio, but I haven't sat out there because there's usually smokers out there.  Also, in a great area to grab a bite to eat - Korea House, Madam Ma'am Thai, and much more.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Great coffee spot to work (inside or outside). Cheap refills and good coffee. Overall a solid spot to meet a friend or work all day.,1
Coffee Shop 20,Nice hippe cafe with weird people in a positive way. Cold brew was okay and it's nice to sit outside -- AC was a little too strong inside.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Great coffee, tea, food selection and fast Wi-Fi. Excellent place to hold a casual business meeting as long as the weather allows for outside seating, inside tends to be more on the quiet side.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in 2016, Texas(s), Caffeination Ahh, Austin: where you can walk into a super hipster-esque coffee shop where Garth Brooks' ""Friends in Low Places"" is playing.  Epoch is perfect for those in need of caffeination. I kept things simple with a 16oz coffee with half and half, but that coffee was definitely expertly brewed. Every drop was definitely worth savoring. My coffee's companion of a blueberry muffin was excellent as well.  The staff were kind and quick with good service. There's also plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, with wifis for each side to boot. Although I only stayed long enough to finish my coffee, Epoch is definitely the kind of coffee shop you can spend hours in, working and getting some caffeination into your system.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Best place for no-fuss coffee in town. Seating is limited but if you're polite you can usually share a spot with someone.  Plenty of outlets and good WiFi in a comfy and lived-in atmosphere.  Many reviews note that staff is arrogant and rude which is simply untrue. They're very kind, just not as robotic and saccharine as people are used to at other businesses.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"2 check-ins I enjoy this little coffee shop. It's located in a little unassuming strip mall with a records store and vintage clothing boutique. The coffee shop itself is fairly large on the inside (for a coffee shop), with a few board games for patrons to play and a random assortment of chairs and couches for people to sit on. There's free wifi and a patio in case you'd like to bring your dog. The patio is separated into a smoking and non-smoking section, so you get to enjoy being outdoors without being bombarded with smoke if you wish. I've only ever gotten the iced coffee, which comes in a large glass that can be refilled for $2. Service has always been quick. There are a variety of other coffee/espresso options on the menu as well as different milks (dairy and non-dairy) that can be added.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Almost killed myself after going here. Never again. The presence of so many pretentious hipster douchebags made me consider giving up on the entire human population. Immeasurably depressing.,0
Coffee Shop 20,"2 check-ins Pretty clutch 24 hour coffee/pizza place in north Austin, I got the olivia slice one night, and the moon walker slice the other, and a chocolate chip cookie, all were really good, im glad they had the moon walker which was white sauce as you don't see that all the time, I'd have loved to try the coffee but it was 2am each time and might not have been the best idea :p hopefully i can try it next time i'm back!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Chill atmosphere, and a great place to go if you happen to be up late. Love that it's open 24/7!  The drink selection isn't my favorite in Austin, but I still think it's pretty good. Great place to study!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"7 check-ins I love being in walking distance of Epoch. I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, so you may wonder why I bother coming here. I am a huge fan of green tea and the peppermint iced green tea is definitely awesome.  I have had the mojo and found it delicious as well.  I love the atmosphere. Inside is cozy and typically has some good music playing (sometimes a little too loudly, but oh well) and outside is a great spot to people watch and enjoy good weather. The staff is friendly and quick. Overall one of my favorite spots on North Loop",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Great vibe. Relatively peaceful. Good service. Good products. Wifi works well. A good variation of seating and tables etc. to accommodate about any need whether reading, studying, chilling, chatting...",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Have been to Epoch several times and recommended it to several family/friends, this review doesn't reflect their product but rather their employee*  Went in around 2:30am today and ordered a caramel macchiato with a friend. Immediately after the cashier says ""you mean like the one at Starbucks"" I laughed and said ""sure haha"" (sarcasm implied). I swipe my card and enter my pin and there was a delay processing the transaction and then it goes through.. $5.00... Before the transaction post the cashier bugs his eyes out at me and said ""what did you do?"" I tipped $1.00... sit down.. wait for my drink and then when I get it, it's literally all milk in a water glass. What the **** ! Come on guys! Completely unnecessary... Ordered Caramel Macchiato. Charged $5.00 given a glass of milk. Great Experience from the ***hole cashier.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"4.5 stars but rounding up since they are open 24/7!! MOJO = DELICIOUS COFFEE. We came in on a Sunday morning for a coffee, and encountered this gigantic coffee shop with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (you can bring your dogs!). Since the mojo is pre-sweetened, and made with dairy, I decided to play it safe by ordering a 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4, yelp.com/user_local_phot…), which was perfect- it wasn't too sweet, and my occasional lactose intolerance didn't kick in. This is highly recommended since it had a great smooth/creamy texture. I would definitely come back just for this. The parking lot is big so parking in the larger back lot shouldn't be an issue- however, the front parking spots that are closer to the entrance fill up quickly. 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"4 check-ins I was craving a Mexican mocha from Epoch so had to stop by before work. I bought a coffee to go and a bagel for about $6. Not Bad. This place is open 24/7 so I never have to worry if I'm too early. It smells so good once you enter. There's nothing like walking into an aroma of coffee and sweets, just a bunch of healthy goodness. LOL One day I will get the chance to sit down and enjoy breakfast here. So far work has my attention. I will be coming here more often!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Our maiden voyage went well, Yelpers led us here, very good coffee drinks in a relaxed atmosphere.  Only thing i'd change is a better variety of...gasp!...artificial and non-artificial sweeteners like stevia, blue packets, green ones, they had pink packets, and two kinds of sugar and agave nectar.  Today's coffee was Portugese...that's what the lady told me!  I knew what she meant....Brazil which is the only country in South America that speaks Portugese....good Jo. See all photos from Tim C. for Epoch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Very cool coffee place.  Total hipster place.  Tons of people hanging and working and web surfing.  I had a great latte with some work associates.  I am not an Austin native but was very happy to have stopped in here to see some authentic Austin.  In a divey small strip with a vintage clothing store right next door.  Need a good coffee or cafe to hang in - if so, I highly recommend. beautiful lattes available here!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I have been going to Epoch coffee most mornings for almost a year and have always had a great Quad Mexican Mocha from anyone who made it.  A few months back my hours changed and I was going to Epoch a few hours earlier than I had been.  As it turns out, the night shift is on so a different guy was now making my latte.  The latte just wasn't as good. I couldn't figure out what it was but I kept going anyway.  Asked for less chocolate, asked for no chocolate...eventually I realized its because my coffee isnt hot.  Pretty much luke warm at best.  Started asking for the milk to be steamed a little longer.  ""well, I cant make it any hotter than that or it will be bitter"" he says. This goes on for a few months. I continue to get a nasty coffee whenever he makes it.  If someone else is working that night, coffee is great.  Even the new guy made one as good as I  have ever had.   Today I go in and again tell him I need the milk steamed a little more.  He laughs and says ""ha, you ask me that every time"".  I say ""Well that's because you are the only person to consistently serve me luke warm coffee""...from any coffee shop...ever.   Apparently he didn't like that because he started mumbling under his breath and eventually says ""Im not going to argue with you"". Motherfucker I wasn't asking for an argument, I coulda just stayed home for that.  I just want a hot coffee. So here he is, steaming it like steaming milk is going out of style.  Serves it up and says ""that's as hot as it gets! I wouldn't normally serve this, but since you complaied so..."" Motherfucker did I ask for ''as hot as it gets''? No.  But congrats to you 'bro'...you still have yet to make a decent latte.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"This is succccchhh a cool coffee shop. Outside seating, indoor vintage interior and furniture. I love it. I grabbed an ice coffee and chilled outside. It was lovely. They are open 24 hours a day and this is the perfect spot to set up shop and do work all day or hang with friends. The food looks good too. Very hipster here and surrounded by vintage shops. I loved it. Good coffee. Highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Austin, TX Great place to study. An abundant amount of tables inside and out. Wifi was pretty fast given the amount of people there. Plenty of outlet space. This place is really unique in that aspect. However I can see it getting filled up pretty quick. I was there before 8 and already more than half of the inside was full.  Espreesso and food were not...great. I felt the espresso tasted really burnt. The breakfast wrap was ok. There are not a lot of food options nor variety. Would not come here for eating or drinking.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"15 check-ins The Good: Wifi is fast, coffee is great, and people don't bother you. Best place to chill and get some work done!  The Bad: if you want to enjoy outdoor patio experience but hate being around smokers this may not be the place for you.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"By far my favorite coffee house in Hyde Park and the surrounding area. Open 24/7 and inhabited by easygoing, down to earth people (customers and staff alike), Epoch provides ample seating (indoor and out-), places to plug-in, and free, strong-signal wifi. However, it can get quite busy, at times, making finding a seat a challenge sometimes. The food and goodie selection is better than average, and includes various yummy vegan offerings. The coffee snob in me gives their coffee products a 7/10--which is good, just not great--and I wish their coffee menu were a little more extensive. However, those are just minor gripes. Epoch is definitely a quality establishment worth patronizing.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Dude on the night shift makes the best espresso I've ever had. I have it everyday cause IT'S THE BEST ESPRESSO I'VE EVER HAD.,1
Coffee Shop 20,Visited this place at 5 am. Absolutely fabulous during the graveyard shift. Ordered a cappuccino made with coconut milk. Devon made it to perfection. Wonderful environment and ambience.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"When I moved to Austin in 2011, I set out to find a good coffee shop. A good coffee place is like a solid base of operations. You can use it to do your taxes, meet someone new, play chess, drink coffee, design a scale model Smurfs village, read a book.  But a truly outstanding coffee shop has a consistently friendly and genuinely kind staff that seems like family. That's really what I get every time I go to Epoch.  Being the introvert-extrovert, I know the staff all recognize my face and none probably know me by name (that's my fault). And those people make the place shine. They of course represent the eclectic and interesting tastes of the Austin community and I would expect nothing less.  Fantastic music plays in the background at all hours. Local artists get display space on the walls. The same guys come in and play four-way chess every Sunday. There's a guy named John who's always there. It's like Cheers but with ACC students and a table in the back that seems to attract Tinder first dates.  There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating: sofas, large cushioned chairs, wooden chairs, stools. There are pull-down electrical outlets for the tables away from the walls. There's indoor wifi. There's also a little mini deli by the cash register with sandwiches, wraps, muffins, cookies. They serve coffee, kombucha, tea, and you can even order a pizza. No one will go hungry here.  There's a strange air about the place. It feels a bit vulnerable, like home. When I walk in on any given day, whether it's after I've rowed on the lake or had a long day at work, I always feel like I could meet someone new (and I often do) and form an instant real connection.  It's just a good place. Check it out.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I have nothing bad to say about this place. The coffee and teas are great. The customers are a mix of students, hipsters, locals, and poets that are left of center. Very relaxed place. Steady stream of customers, but I have never experienced an unreasonably long wait. Great stop during the day.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I was visiting a friend in Austin and Epoch was right across the street so I thought I'd check it out and get some work in for a couple hours. I'm not a big coffee drinker so you should be asking yourself why is he here but I was happy to see they have smoothies. I went with the Pineapple Paradise and yes it was paradise in my mouth. I'm not really sure what was in it other than pineapple but I'm not complaining! They also have pizza by the slice and I went with the white pizza (it has a crazy name which I can't remember). Solid and thin crust but a little pricey at $3.25 or $3.75 a slice...my memory is escaping me.  Maybe because the sightseeing at Epoch is spectacular. Hipsters galore in all assortments of ridiculous outfits. Even a girl with armpit hair, hooray! You will not be disappointed trust me. This is better than sightseeing at the airport or your local Walmart.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"If you're a fan of gorgeous hipsters playing chess, smooth coffee & spicy chai and fast wifi - you'll be happy with an afternoon spent here. Almond milk chai and a greek salad with amazing chipotle lime dressing",1
Coffee Shop 20,"If I could give this place 0 stars and still leave a review I would. Epoch was my go-to favorite coffee place until today.  I am dog-sitting my parents' Boston Terrier who lives out on their ranch (i.e., in the middle of nowhere). He rarely is brought around strangers and other dogs (besides my parent's other dog) and is thus very anxious and on edge when people he doesn't know or animals he doesn't know approach him. He is not a violent dog by any means and has never bitten anyone or anything but he is still a dog none the less and when animals are stressed, you never know what could happen. I cannot tie him up and leave him alone outside of places because of this. Also, he is smaller and cute so people always want to come up to him and pet him, which he gets freaked out by even when someone he knows is holding him/near him.  I decided to walk to Epoch with him to get a coffee. When I got there, no employees were outside on the patio and I've NEVER had an issue picking him up, walking into a place and asking them if they could take my order outside because I can't tie him up. I proceed to do this when the girl at the counter (long dark curly hair) was HORRENDOUSLY rude to me. The faces she made at me during our brief conversation and the condescending tone in her voice was unacceptable. I merely asked if someone could take my order outside and her response was ""Um NO, this is a restaurant and you're violating the health code"". I've seen dogs on the patio of Epoch NUMEROUS times AND if you are a RESTAURANT (as she kept reiterating to me as if I don't know what a restaurant is and progressively speaking louder and slower like I was a child or inept in some way), then you should be capable of taking someone's order outside on the patio.  Honestly, I would have been fine if she had at least been polite and apologetic. HOW she chose to say things and the disgusting faces she made at me where completely and utterly uncalled for. Epoch, if you'd like to keep customers, you may want to have a chat with your employees about how to treat customers because I will NEVER spend another penny at Epoch. Nothing to do with your policies (completely understandable and I was just asking, I was NOT demanding rules be changed or ignored) and EVERYTHING to do with how your employee chose to treat me today. There was no reason for her to respond to me like that. I was calm, polite and just asking a question. Actually, there is no reason to treat anyone like that, service industry or otherwise.",0

Right down the street from shopping and bars at North Loop, it gets packed by end of a weekday afternoon.  Great place to work remote - open a tab and grab a seat.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"5 check-ins Listed in Give me coffee or give me death! WWHHHAAATTT? Yelp told me I haven't been here before. WWHHHAAATTT? Okay let me write this review which needs to be written. My God, I haven't been here before. It was raining in Austin and instead of staying home, I developed a case of cabin fever which you might think is the worst time to get it. Usually when it rains, it's unsafe to drive in this weather. I decided to brave the elements and decide to go out. I'm glad I did. Parking can be a nuisance but I was fortunate to find parking in their parking lot. When I enter where every table is full of people studying and working on their laptops. Service was great and I had some of their iced coffee. There was plenty of outside seating which I didn't mind sitting because I love watching the rain. A big plus was when they were playing Jesus and the Mary Chain. It doesn't get any perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"The concept is awesome, but the service in sub par. The Barista's seem to always be in a bad mood, which really bums me out. They've even been rude to me a few times because they were frustrated with other customers. Not cool, going back to Strange Brew.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"I had their signature drink, an iced mojo. It pretty refreshing but the taste was watered down. If there's coffee in it, it's pretty weak...and I'm not one who needs espressos to function. A black tea is enough pick me up. But this didn't do much for me.  I can never say no to a blueberry muffin with streusel on top, so I had that as well. While it didn't taste mass-produced, it didn't taste fresh either. Whoever made it was also heavy handed with the almond extract (or at leasts thats what my palate picked up) which I was not a fan of.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Had a cortado. Really nice and creamy espresso. Staff was nice. The food options looked good, but I didn't have anything. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Ok environment, burnt coffee.  I wish they would use a better roast.  Will not go back.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"One of my favorite coffee spots in Austin.  Mostly because it's open 24/7, which makes total sense.  I am that person who gets a hankering for that hot Mexican mocha at 12AM.    It's a big hang out for the hipsters and students, which is ok by me, but you will see people from all walks here.  I grew up in this area so it's nostalgic as well.  I've always loved the Starbucks sign behind the counter.    I've never had any issues with staff, I've always been treated with friendly service.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"14 check-ins Epoch is my FAVORITE spot to hang out in Austin. It is an artsy, eclectic, WEIRD art gallery, coffee shop, wireless mecca. You can post up all day and get some work done, hang out with a friend, enjoy a date, read a good book, or just chill out on the lovely outdoor deck. The beverage selection is SUPERB.  The hubby and I have claimed two well-broken in chairs as our own and are thrilled when they are both available, as it gets quite busy over at Epoch what with all of the students frequent this haunt.  The people watching at Epoch is a hobby in its own right!  It's a perfect microcosm for the city, attracting people of all ages and creeds. As I'm not a coffee person, I usually enjoy a Caramel Italian Cream Soda or a delicious Mexican Hot Chocolate with whipped cream while my husband sips on a double espresso.    My favorite thing about Epoch is the Peewee Herman doll sitting high above all of us minions looking down upon us with benevolence.  One really interesting fact about is that Epoch as a Geocache hidden on its premises!  If you are new to geocaching, this is a cool one to start with. Remember to bring something to leave behind! :-) Easy breezy Epoch Saturday at Epoch Mexican hot chocolate & large coffee See all photos from Sheila F. for Epoch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 20,Great place. Had the Iced Mojo and bagel dog. Food was good. The building was neat. Overall good place.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"This place is awesome! It gets points for atmosphere, including music selection, the fact that they serve pizza, free WiFi, open 24/7, friendly staff, tasty drinks and pastries, etc. I will definitely be back. I ordered the cinnamon roll, moon tower pizza, and hibiscus iced tea.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Like a *Hipster Remix - Madonna  I made it through the traffic Somehow I made it through Didn't know how tired I was Until I found you I was beat Incomplete I'd been had, I was sad and blue But you made me feel Yeah, you made me feel Awake and new Hoo, Like a hipster Caffeinated for the very first time Like a hipster When your latte swirls Next to mine",1
Coffee Shop 20,"One of the best coffee houses in Austin. Has a nice cool, relaxed vibe and the patio is awesome. Love that I can bring my dog here too! There is a wide variety of drinks at the coffee bar, all of which have been very good. The prices are good and the staff is always upbeat and helpful. The only down fall is everyone love is too so it can be hard to find a seat.",1
Coffee Shop 20,The pizza was yummy. Coffee was perfect. Barista was friendly. Will definitely be back. In my top 3 places for coffee out here. It's a good place for some late night relaxing.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Poor internet service. They don't put a password on their WIFI and probably half the neighborhood is using it.  Wasted twenty minutes combined waiting on the internet to work - not good when you don't have a ton of time.  Otherwise, great meeting place but won't go there to work.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Love the kitschy decor of this place. Super cool, very nice and weird ATX vibe.  Tons of great options and food! Plenty of seating and free wifi!  Order the half iced Mojo and Iced coffee and enjoy it there in the shop. Love the crushed ice and the exceptionally tall glass.  Skip over Starbucks and give this place a try!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Mojo...Hmm what's mojo? And why don't I have some already?    It was quite perfectly  a slow roasted coffee which produces a creamy texture.  I opted for the half mojo half iced coffee as I don't care for things that are too sweet.  As Austin Powers once said ""Who stole my mojo?""  Trust me once you have had their mojo you will be back for more. Half ice mojo Half iced Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Really bad service. Hipster bad service Austin for ya, which still boggles my mind when you have this thing called the INTERNET and WORD OF MOUTH.  Plus, their coffee sucks.  I asked for an espresso and he was annoyed/unsure that I would ask such a question.  ""Ya.... we just have one espresso blend.'  Here's the thing... if cofffee was great, crappy service wouldn't be as much of a concern. If service was great, crappy coffee wouldn't be as bad of a thing.  But when you have crappy coffee and crappy service... wtf are you thinking? Like who runs this shit?  Instill some damn culture and fire the hipster fcks.  Plus, out loud telling people to ""leave unless you are going to buy something"" is really bad business. Like who said that was ok? The universe works itself out. If people don't buy and take up tables, you will only hurt business more by making a big deal about it than you will prevent it. It's just idiotic.  I bought an espresso and after hearing that it makes me never want to come back or buy again. In fact, it almost makes me want to come with my own stained espresso cup and placing it next to my computer and using the free wifi.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Another good local coffeeshop. Plenty of outlets. Fast internet. But it can be crowded at times....the bathroom might have a line and parking might be difficult. You never see the place empty....it's popular.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"While not being a coffee drinker, I have extremely high praise for this coffee house. Nestled into a quiet North Loop neighborhood, their copious amount of seating (and power outlets), speedy wifi, and incredibly friendly staff makes this place a hidden gem. I ordered their Moon Tower pizza slice (since I forgo coffee) and it was very tasty - hand prepared after I ordered - not some pre-packaged cold alternative. Overall, a very big fan and will be returning!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"My wife and I are regulars here. We almost always order the Mexican Mocha, although we've tried the teas, mojo, and iced coffee and all were good. 4/5 times the coffee is perfect and definitely a favorite. Unfortunately, every now and then the milk is not hot enough which completely kills the mocha for me.  In the mornings, they also sell tacos, the Princess Leia is my favorite. Even though they are not made there, they are always warm.  This location in particular is often full, so we normally take it to go. However, we love to sit in when they are not as packed.  Definitely recommend it!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins Listed in a latte love There's pretty much only two main twenty-four seven coffee houses in Austin for students to pull those dreaded all-nighters: Bennu and Epoch. Each has their own little charm although the one thing they have in common is the dark and [slightly] cozy atmosphere (...sometimes) and the overcrowded parking lots and even more overcrowded unavailable seats.  I go to Epoch a lot. In memory of all those late-night study moments and even later nights catching up with old friends, Epoch has become an honorary friend. How could a friend rank any lower than four stars? Epoch has kept me going far too often for me to actually think it's any less.  But let's go with the truth on this review:  I do like Epoch. I wouldn't go if I didn't like it at least a little. Their coffee is aight, and I stay awake for the most part. Personally, I've gone far past immune on caffeine alone and only stay alive with the help of loads of sugar, so the only thing that really helps me is their sweet mochas.  But to be honest--their coffee, as I've said only a moment ago, is simply... simply aight. From their black coffee to their lattes to their mochas and even their special (the Iced Mojo), if I were thinking of coffee alone, I wouldn't actually say Epoch serves the best or my favorite.  I don't really like the Iced Mojo--not even the half. I think it tastes like watered down coffee and sweetener. Their regular coffee isn't bad. I think it's better than Bennu's--at least their late night servings, anyway. It's a little on the sour side of coffee, if anyone knows what I mean by that. Their flavored lattes are super sweet. It's kind of ridiculous how sweet they are. I like their mochas--they're sweet but on the richer side with a deeper undertone. I prefer the Mexican Mocha over the Dutch because it has a sweeter flavor to it.  Their music taste is quite a variety. Sometimes, it works while I study. Other times, it overpowers my music in the weirdest ways possible. I don't really need metal at 3 AM, thanks...  Service is a mix, depending on the day. I've had friendly baristas (usually the older ones), and I've had unfriendly baristas (usually the younger ones). Weird how that works, I guess.  Do I think Epoch is great? Not really. But I prefer it a lot more than Bennu's, and I can't give it any less of a rating because it has been so kind to all those terrible nights of studying...  So to 24/7 coffee houses. There only need be more of them.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I came here on the way to a canoeing trip and it was so early that I was dying for coffee to function.  I just ordered a regular coffee and whatever beans they use are amazing!  It had the flavor, the kick you need and I didn't feel bad parting with my money after the cup was empty.  I also loved the interior; not too fancy and inviting!  Also, super convenient to I-35 and more than enough parking!  They also have breakfast tacos that are really delicious and made to order!  You can't beat this for the price, quality and quick service on food and beverage items!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I lived within walking distance to this coffee shop for about a year. I would often find myself wandering over to have a cup of coffee and just sit outside on the patio. I thought of myself as a regular and found the staff to be generally pleasant. A friend texted me asking if I would meet him at epoch for a quick chat. I had already purchased a coffee from another shop so I didn't feel the need to purchase one at epoch. My friend purchased his coffee at epoch and waited for me at a table outside. We sat for about two minutes when a bald guy (epoch staff) walked over and very snidely commented that these tables were for customers. I was so insulted! The friend I was meeting HAD purchased a drink from them. The place wasn't packed, there was space available. I am always very contentious of these types of situations, and had the place been crowded, I would not have taken a seat. This guy went over board and they have lost my business for good.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Coffee was fine, food was fine. But the staff was extremely impersonal and too busy trying to give me the total I owed rather actually listening to what I wanted.  I was seriously given the total 4 times in between telling them each coffee drink needed and each food item ordered. (And after living in New York I don't languish over ordering, and there was only one person in line behind me). I also wanted to buy some coffee beans but since I was getting pushed out the door, they missed that extra sale.  I'm pretty sure it'll be the only time I visit.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Great coffee shop! Solid coffee options, but almost always hard to get seating. Also wish there was a bigger no smoking section with more comfortable seating outside.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This is the original Epoch (on North Loop), and I love the place. They serve excellent coffees and teas and have a variety of pastries, pizzas, salads, etc.  The staff is super. The place has a wonderful down home feel to it kind of like Central Perk on ""Friends."" It's often packed with students, but all kinds of people go there regularly, like artists, chess players, business people, lovers, and (especially on weekends) families.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I went to this place four or five times over the course of a two-week business trip. I tried their hot chocolate, iced tea, and cappuccino and all of them were quality products. The hot chocolate in particular was really yummy and was basically my go-to drink. I never stuck around to enjoy the ambiance, but that's not Epoch's fault. It seems like a good place to crack open your laptop and get some work done, or catch up with an old friend. I always liked seeing the *ahem* colorful Starbucks sign in the back of the place. I'd probably go here all the time if I lived in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Expectations of a 24 hour Austin coffee shop: 1). Super hipster barista--met by enthusiastic bearded fellow with long hair and a ""bike shop"" (based on overheard convo with other customers) and stray dogs he feeds 2) Tons of people writing next 50 Shades or developing next Pay Pal--met by tons of people plugged into the nifty overhead reel cords (like you'd have in your garage or shop) 3) eclectic decor--met by bathroom (see my photo) 4) Smokers consuming many types of product--met by numerous outdoor patrons (note to guy probably smoking weed--pay attention to wind direction--you must not be a hunter--sitting ""up front"" would have been more undercover!!) 5) And, oh by the way, coffee!--met by lovely drink I had. 6) snacks--the reason I'm only giving 4 stars--they had nothing gluten free except maybe breakfast tacos which were already pretty much sold out by my time of arrival. I did not ask about these--if they were corn tortilla, then they would qualify. But would it be too much trouble to toss a macaroon into the pastry case?   Great place to hang out and get something done. Huge indoor and outdoor seating--right near a little stream. Classy restroom graffiti. Mocha art",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Thoroughly disappointed. I love exploring local coffee shops but this is one I won't be coming back to.  First, it has an unappetizing smell from the second you open the door. Kind of musty and moldy. The woman who helped me seemed like me placing an order was an inconvenience to her. She had a huge attitude. And my chai tasted like the milk was microwaved.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Not the best coffee shop in Austin, but not the worst one either.  Decided to try their pumpkin spice latte. It was nothing special and really didn't have enough of the pumpkin flavor I was hoping for.  The shop has a very casual atmosphere and the music was nice.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"I totally enjoy Epoch. It's open 24/7 and a lot of people go there for long, no sleep, studying. It's chill, it's quiet, it's big, and they serve good stuff. If you're in the area, this is the coffeehouse to go to.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Love it here! Yummy coffee, super cute atmosphere, sweet tunes, close proximity to other cool local shops. A little hard to find a seat during finals with lots of studiers but hell yeah- shop local kids. Winning all around here!",1
Coffee Shop 20,6 check-ins 24/7... Amazing lattes... Decent amount of comfortable seating. What more can you ask for?! I love coming here to study and hangout. Great vibe and great drinks.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Awesome place. The atmosphere is awesome, just my speed. Vintage lights and an earthy feel. The staff was friendly and  appeared to enjoy their jobs which is important to me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in My Fix, Second Home Epoch is one of the quintessential 24-hour Austin coffee shops, so you can imagine plenty of late nights that I've spent here. The indoor space actually isn't particularly large, but there's way more outside seating than Bennu - a blessing when the weather is cooperating; a curse at most times of the year.  I'm not the biggest fan of Epoch's drinks, but I have to give it up for the Mexican chocolate mocha - that hint of spiciness really makes a memorable drink that outclasses plenty of other coffee shops' drinks.  The atmosphere at Epoch is actually quite conducive to studying; in the multiple times that I've been, the music wasn't too overbearing, but there have been occasions that it gets a little too rowdy - no worries, pop your headphones on/in, and you'll be good to go. Parking is ok; when the lot is full, it's a sign that inside will be crammed, too.  Of course, since Epoch is 24/7, the shop will get pretty packed, and the wifi is periodically not-so-good, which could probably contribute to productivity. I still prefer Bennu, but I've spent some great nights at Epoch, and that Mexican chocolate mocha - let me tell you, it puts up a fight.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Really good coffee, super friendly staff. Great vibes, would've loved to stick around. Had just straight up iced coffee and it was really good, solid.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"51 check-ins I love coffee. All coffee. Cheap coffee, fancy coffee. French press and 7 Eleven. Epoch is not about the coffee. It is about the coffee house. Their coffee is fine, I usually get a black eye, but don't go for the coffee. Don't go for the food -- excluding the bageldogs, I often kick my morning off with them. But really you go for more than acceptable coffee and over-salted snacks.  Go for the Austin. Epoch is often what Austin is. Youngish, energetic/caffeinated, high speed internet, listening to music that you haven't heard of and reading books that seem deep, or are required by UT courses.  Epoch has flaws -- but go get some caffeine, take a book that makes you look interesting and people watch your afternoon away. Graffiti at epoch. Epoch set up, red eye, bagel dog and code.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins This is a fun place to sit back, have a beverage, browse the net and hipster watch. I really enjoy the collection of people that congregate here, it makes the place vibrant and unique. It's not at all like a sterile coffee shop trying to be cool (rhymes with Barstucks)  This place is the real deal. It's next to a great vintage clothing and record shop too, so plan on spending some time in the area. The parking can get a little hectic at busy times, but that's just part of the charm.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"My husband and I have started coming here every weekend. Their coffee is amazing. I love iced coffee, but I like to sweeten it myself; they have simple syrup out for use so I get it PERFECT EVERY TIME!  Free wifi and plugs hang from the ceiling--this place rocks.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Austin Cafes Epoch is an ideal place to take out-of-towners for a taste of Austin's coffee culture. The patio is vibrant, the crowd is super interesting and friendly, and the drinks are tasty. I will say that even though it has tons of seating/outlets and is open late night, I wouldn't recommend it for getting work done. Especially if you're like me and can't focus when the table next to you is playing Cards Against Humanity and/or AC/DC is playing in the background. (This exact scenario happened to me last winter when I made the mistake of trying to study for a final here on a Friday night. Lolz.)  So for after hours study sesh, Bennu is definitely a better bet. But if you want to hang out with friends on a Friday night like a normal person, this is about as good as it gets.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Epoch is a great place to study, read, or just have coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxed. I came here with a friend to study and stayed here for plenty of hours.  Pros: Great atmosphere, good location (close to campus), has plugs located through out the cafe, great selection of coffees and pastries (better than bennu in my opinion).  On my first trip here I asked the cashier if she would recommend for a drink for me, I was looking for something cold and sweet, she suggested the Mojo (only available at Epoch) and even gave me a sample. It was the perfect blend between something coffee/mocha/sweet, I loved it and it is go to drink every time. The ice they use in the drinks is the perfect, it has a texture between shaved and crushed ice.  They have a very nice selection of pastries, and I would have to recommend the cinnamon roll. It is the BEST cinnamon roll I have ever had, imagine a croissant with cinnamon sugar in-between its layers then rolled up, baked to perfection, topped with just the right amount of icing and then some. If you get the cinnamon roll be sure to ask them to heat it up or your experience will just not be the same.  They also allow you to keep an open tab at the cashier as long as you give them your card to hold on as collateral, just make sure you close your tab before 24 hours or else they will charge a 10% tip on top of your tab.  Cons: They keep their air condition on and running, this place is COLD, make sure you bring a jacket or your will end up freezing your pants off. (I love the cold, this place is even cold in my standards, but I like the cold, still bring a jacket). There is a smell in the restrooms that personally I have a hard time getting over. It smells, used and dirty, not to mention there is graffiti all over the walls, and not very stylish graffiti if I might add. Parking kinda sucks, but then again it sucks at almost every 24 hour place, on the upside I was able to find parking here a lot easier than at Bennu.  Overall, this is my new goto study spot around UT and will be coming very often. Best cinnamon roll ever! Make sure you ask to have it warmed up!",1
Coffee Shop 20,Relaxing atmosphere to hand with friends or do some studying. pastries and pizza are very good. There cinnamon bus are great as well. One of my favorite places to study. recommended this place to anyone who needs a relaxing atmosphere and guilty deserts in the evening.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"This was one of the first coffee shops I experienced when I decided to attend school at UT Austin. A friend invited me out to check out the place while he was working on his dissertation. It was within walking distance. It didn't feel like any other coffee establishment I ever visited. Not only are there friendly baristas preparing drinks and food, it had such good vibes to the point where I immediately felt comfortable enough to take a short power nap on the couch next to my friend. I never recalled ever doing that in a public place in my life, and yet I felt so much at home. I was initially surprised by the variety of people you run into at this place. People were taking part in lively discussions and ideas while live music was playing in the background. There were several people playing chess outside. It was very enjoyable.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"The coffee here is definitely subpar.  I got a hot vanilla latte and it tasted very burnt and milky.  I also tried a breakfast taco (sausage, eggs, and bacon) and it was good, but definitely not worth $2.50.  The service is not very friendly.  I came with one one other person and as soon as I placed my order she walked away without even taking the other persons order.   Then a guy came up to the register to complete our order and he was equally as rude.    The space itself has a lot of room for you to come work and hangout.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Very cool coffee house... I have written the better part of a book in off beat coffee and this one near UT has great retro-weird-youthful spirit Epoch coffee...24/7 From the back wall at Epoch coffee. I'm sitting on my mothers 1980s couch,1
Coffee Shop 20,"The I-35 of Austin coffee shops...always packed, bumper to bumper parking, slow moving line.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Overall, this place is awesome. Great coffee, great lattes, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The reason I am giving them four stars is because smoking is allowed outdoors on the deck. People can sit only two feet away from the entrance and smoke. There is another outdoor section just around the corner that doesn't allow smoking, BUT I personally think they should ban cigarettes on the property altogether. It is not healthy and of course not pleasant to be breathing in secondhand smoke while trying to enjoy your coffee. I hope they will take this in consideration.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I went to this place before it was cool, just like pretty much everyone else. I also tried the coffee before it was cool, and burned my mouth.  Definitely hipster, this enjoyable little coffee house is more about the house than the coffee. The coffee is still very good, but almost not their main focus. Don't forget to bring your laptop... Or typewriter to be more authentic. Outdoor seating area",1
Coffee Shop 20,"2 check-ins I mean, it's open 24/7 !!! That's enough for me!!! But seriously, they have a pretty good amounts of coffees and lattes.... And their Danishes are kick ass! Hazelnut latte on ice with a cherry Danish.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"4.5. Come here regularly, glad to see business is picking up! Staff is always on their game, great iced coffee, good seating options, and definitelyl convenient.  I have to agree with some of the posters that the drip coffee needs to get better (at least the dark roast does), especially as the weather cools down and iced coffee will no longer be an option!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Big open space and some good coffee. Come here to get some work done. Right now. I'm behind you.  Parking would seem impossible but you can park in the retail space on the south side of that unit. Or normal congress street parking,1
Coffee Shop 3,+Great espresso -Drip coffee was okay +Lots of non dairy milk choices -Very few gluten free options,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Dropped in for an afternoon coffee with friends. The shop is super hip and clean. Really enjoyed the iced coffee. It was bold but smooth.  They have tons of beer, great coffee, pastries, and fresh, raw juices! They juiced the fresh veggies right in front of us, and it tasted great!  Highly recommend dropping by if you want some coffee, juice, or beer! Great one-stop shop! Super hip and cool! Huge scones!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Loved the vibe in Apanas! Great place to relax and have a beer or coffee. They have games to play and the food is also delicious. Totally recommend the place.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"I was downtown for ACL Live at Threadgill's and parked a couple of blocks away, across from Apanas. I went inside to get a quick bite to eat, and noticed this shop is very new (I've been to the one in North Austin at The Domain). This is a very nice coffee shop with ample seating and I noticed some working there as well. I wanted to share a review and encourage those visiting downtown for #ACLFest, #SXSW or Austin Convention Center conferences to stop by. It is located across the street from the Chevron station at the corner of Riverside and Congress, up the hill just a block or so on the left. Easy to get to!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"This is an AMAZING coffee shop!! The pumpkin latte and blueberry scone were so delicious, and the owner Aamil was so friendly and poured my latte himself. The atmosphere is clean but fun, and I love the murals. The music was great. Great hang out spot. See all photos from Sari I. for Apanas Coffee & Beer",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Awesome new coffee shop on South Congress! The space is large, bright, and airy. Generally quiet, so it's the perfect study space. In addition to the 2-top tables that are great for getting work done, there are also three large, family-style tables and a long bar-top, so Apanas is also ideal for groups or dates. The staff are friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. The coffee itself is sourced directly from Nicaragua, where the owner himself traveled and hand-picked the beans. They also offer a selection of cold-pressed juices, craft beers, pastries, and meal items.  The food and drink are top notch quality. The staff are wonderful. If you're looking for a quiet and open coffeeshop to study, a small meeting place, or an unassuming beer, this is your place!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Loved this place! We stayed around the corner so ended up passing by to and from our hotel. These guys were so nice. Great beer. Great coffee. Very friendly and definitely a place we will come back to next time we're in Austin.,1
Coffee Shop 3,Stopped in for a quick pit stop to get out of the heat. Found out Apanas had only just opened. The staff was so friendly and nice. Great humor and indulged us in some conversation. Selection of beers is great. Coffee is good. Appreciate all the non-dairy milks on offer. Highly recommend!,1
Coffee Shop 3,What an awesome little cafe and beer bar! Aamil the owner and Tony the beer manager were so friendly! And the tap list was on point !!,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Apanas is definitely my favorite coffee in the north Austin area. Best drips in town! Mix that with great beer, sandwiches, fresh juices and great people, you get Apanas. Now it's in S Austin! Perfection.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"My family came here for afternoon drinks. The environment was very friendly and the service was wonderful.  The bartender was. Wet knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap. The noise level was pleasant, with the exception of some odd music choices. It seems to be a great place to go for a beer if you want to be able to hear each other talk.",1
Coffee Shop 3,Good selection of local Austin area craft beers and coffee drinks. The location is brand new so everything is very clean and modern. Staff was friendly and helpful as well.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. I just had a latte on my way to a meeting, but this would be a great place to do some work. They also have several local drafts on tap.",1
Coffee Shop 3,Really enjoying a pour over coffee and the delightful staff. Looking to come back here later to try out all the beers on tap!,1
Coffee Shop 3,First to Review We've enjoyed the Domain location.  Excited it's coming to SoCo!!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The staff is great here. There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be quiet, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Really cool place! I had a meeting scheduled here by someone, and I am so glad they did. Great vibe and atmosphere! Highly recommend!  This is a gem!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I'm not sure what I did to the workers at this Epoch but they never give me more than 1-word answers and indifferent service. I went in yesterday to order a pour over (overpriced at $5). The cashier took my order and walked over to the area where they make pour overs. I tried to strike up a conversation and got 1-word answers. The barista and other cashier interactions were the same. They were very friendly to some people that appeared to be regulars so maybe it was just me. The Ethiopian pour over was fine but other coffees I've had were nothing special, certainly not enough to make me return anymore. I should've just kept driving down the street to Genuine Joe's, my regular joint that always has good coffee and friendly service.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Wifi is fast!  Mocha's cinnamony and sweet. Not my style but I'm sure it is for some.  Latte is pretty low on that sharp espresso taste, kinda asleep.  Just the one men's toilet and there was a line with maybe 25% of the place filled - if you walk in and this place is full you better be leaving with that coffee!",0
Coffee Shop 20,The fella with he big beard and glasses sold me on the Ethiopian V60 pour over. I'm not a big fan of coffee but this man sold me on the best cup of joe I've ever had. I'll be returning again! Thank you for being so kind and patient. The world needs more people like you! Ethiopian V60 pour over!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I'm not from Austin, but I've been to more than few coffee shops here. When I'm staying in North Austin, Epoch is my new fave. There's plenty of space, a back area with tables, and super fast wifi. Like legit. I went to another spot in east Austin and they were rocking dial up...like for real. I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly. What more do you need when you're writing/studying/on a blind date? It's comfortable and the coffee is great. Check it out next time your in north Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Easily my favorite coffee shop in the entire city.  Had a couple friends come in town, so I couldn't wait to take them there as they are both huge coffee fanatics as well.  Unfortunately, this time the service was less than acceptable.   The guy working the counter was clearly pissed off about working this day, and made sure that everyone ordering knew it.  I gave him my order and afterwards, he just looked at me, then told me the total, without ever acknowledging what I asked for; and same with my girlfriend. My friends were behind us and were ordering next.  They had never been here, and wanted something cold since it was so hot outside.  They tried ordering a ""frappucino"", and they got snapped back that they don't have ""frappucinos"".  They asked if they had something similar, and he said ""yeah, we have the ""blended"" drinks.  When they asked about what flavors were available, he said ""the sign is above you"".  They had never had Horchata before, so they asked what it was, and he responded ""it would take too long to explain what it is, so it is basically a cinnamon flavored coffee drink"".   Very disappointed with the service on this most recent visit, but at least the coffee drinks were great as always; just embarrassing to ""show off"" my favorite coffee place to out of town friends and get this type of visit.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"7 check-ins Love this place! Excellent Americanos. Great layout, cozy and warm decor, always friendly baristas, patio seating out back. A small cozy bar as well. This place is usually pretty quiet when I go in between 12 and 3. Lots of people on their laptops. They do have some food, I think most is premade.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Listed in Coffee Shop Working This is my favorite place to drink coffee and work. It's in a nice complex where you can walk around for a break.,1
Coffee Shop 20,Wow. Had their mocha. It was outstanding. My Starbucks cultured taste buds now have a new definition of good coffee. Things will never be the same after this. One sip and i couldn't resist. Thought about licking the mug. But people were around.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This coffee place is a hidden gem in North Austin.  Think a cross between Mozart's and ""your local"" where people know you and actually talk to you.  They don't just ask your name.  Their latte art was the best I've seen, and yes, I've been to Medici Really pretty coffee art on my mocha",1
Coffee Shop 20,This place is busy busy. I see why now! The coffee is good and cheap!!! It seems too busy and crammed though. Not a type of study place to go too if you're looking for quiet. There are tons of tables and plugs for your laptop/charger though. Baristas were friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"The food and coffee Drinks are great and usually decent customer service, but this time there was a new worker who seemed impatient and not friendly so I will probably not go back again. There's plenty of coffee shops in Austin where staff is very very friendly!",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Coffee is OK but as others have said here, the baristas are hit and miss. When I'm paying you $5 for a latte, I don't need it topped with steamed attitude. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Love Epoch!! hands down my favorite coffee shop in North Austin. Could live off those Iced Mojo's :),1
Coffee Shop 20,Excellent Coffee. Really good atmosphere. I really enjoyed my experience here. It was a really good place to get some work done. It is very cozy!!! They also have super fast wifi too !!!,1
Coffee Shop 20,Good place to work from. Only complaint is the restroom wait time... it can be very long for guys. Guys don't have their own restroom... they share the only one we have with women and women already have two stalls in theirs. Wtf? Can the only men restroom be just for men? Women already have two.,0
Coffee Shop 20,"One of my favorite coffee places. I get a iced soy vanilla latte, the espresso is amazing! My only complaint is they only have one size and it is small for the price compared to other local coffee shops but you do get what you pay for in flavor.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.  The barista was so sweet and patient with me and all of my questions. ""What's good here?"" ""Do u have vanilla almond milk?"" Ect. The drink was made in a jiffy with a beautiful latte leaf design to go. I will definitely be coming back soon.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Updated review I went back to Epoch recently and I think they might have a new manager. They recently closed for a deep cleaning and it's WAY warmer in there now. Also the baristas that were jerks seem to be gone. The coffee is even better.  Seems like they're made a lot of positive changes, which is why I wanted to do this update!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Great place to come off of Anderson Lane. I live in the neighborhood so I come here all the time. Great place to drink coffee and hang out with friends. Small and intimate area but nice courtyard in the back to move around.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em Overall there's nothing wrong with this place. This one-time rating is based mainly on the cranky barista.  SERVICE I don't like to hand out 2-star reviews just based on service but man, this guy was so verbally passive-aggressive I wanted to just hand him a stack of post-it notes so he could write down his thoughts rather than muttering them under his breath in a way we both knew I could still hear him.  AMBIANCE Bumpin 90's R&B like yoooo that Destiny's Child and Tupac!! There is a good amount of seating but a lot of people were there studying as well. Not very hipster -- more of a Panera Bread kind of feel, which is fine.  DRANK A good selection of Asian and Herbal teas. Tax is included! A pot of tea is $4, and I settled on a warm genmaicha to counter the cold and misty weather outside. The pot and cup were a pretty shade of ultramarine blue as well :)  Tl;Dr You'll probably have a better experience than I did, provided that the service doesn't throw sass and shade at you.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Staff: Super friendly and accommodating. Products: Great drinks and they carry Zhi Tea, which is the best tea in town Location: As a Northie, hard to beat. Always plenty of parking. So glad this place exists.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"BIG THANKS to Britt @ Epoch Coffee for introducing San Francisco's most delicious coffee roaster, Ritual Coffee Roasters, to The Great State of Texas!!  This coffee is so delish it doesn't need cream and it sure as heck doesn't need sugar. It's delicious all until itself and Britt made sure Epoch Coffee serves it daily. They also sell it by the package to enjoy at home.  Ritual was started in the heart of the Mission district in San Francisco by Eileen Hassi in 2005. I remember when I worked at Flora Grubb Gardens Eileen teaching me about coffee flavors and roasting while she hand stamped her paper cups with a rubber stamp.

Coffee Shop 20,"I just edited my review to 0 stars cuz the guy at the front harassed me and RUDELY came over and said ""did you need to order???"" And I said I already had a drink and he was like ""not since I've been here and we're getting busy........."" And that was the most rudest thing I've ever encountered with a business like how many drinks do u want me to get when I go somewhere??? I understand it's a business, but I already ordered something! Horrible employees! This guy had a typical weird austin beard and glasses. This place is a joke. I asked him like am I supposed to order after a certain period of time? Like what is this, buy 1 thing every hour? I've gone to a lot of places to study and this is gross customer service. I think he thinks I'm lying about getting a drink earlier, but that's HIS greedy little problem not mine!  I got a chai tea latte with almond milk and 3 splendas. It didn't come with one of those pouring thingies, I guess that's just for the regular plain teas. The drink wasn't hot like I like it. Right when I brought it to the table I could drink it right away and considering it was so cold outside I really wanted it hottt, but it wasn't at all so that was pretty weird..they need to turn up the heat on their machines. I gave this place 4 stars cuz of the prices! Holy moly, my small cup was $4.25!! Too much. The music is loud. Chai tea latte - almond milk and 3 splendas (made up a healthier version).",0
Coffee Shop 20,"118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art. See all photos from Errol M. for Epoch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I keep giving this place a shot over and over hoping it will get better...but it doesn't. Keep in mind I drink black coffee. I hate anything in my coffee, so if you're looking for mochas or lattes, my review probably won't help you.  My iced and hot americanos were disgusting every time I ordered them. They looked like dirty water, and tasted worse. I tried the iced coffee thinking maybe I'd just stay away from the espresso. It's not much better. For some reason both the americanos and iced coffee have a horribly bitter/I-don't-even-know-how-to-describe-it taste. It's not a flavor in coffee with which I'm familiar. And I've worked in two coffee shops and been drinking coffee since long before I should have started.  I'll admit that while I do appreciate certain coffees more than others, I'm able to appreciate/stand pretty much any coffee, anywhere. I had to throw out my almost-full iced americano, and the others I drank more of basically because I was there with a friend, I paid for them, and I knew that they weren't going to make them any better. But I didn't finish any of them.  I'll also agree on the comments about the attitudes of the employees. I often feel like I'm an inconvenience to them.  The only reason I keep coming here is because I meet a friend about once a week, and she likes this place (for the mojos) and it's a good in-between meet-up. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to request a new meeting place.  If you're in the mood for tea, however, go for it. Even if you're not...go for it.",0
Coffee Shop 20,3 check-ins Great coffee and espresso. Above average wifi. Lots of seating. Not enough power outlets. OK outdoor space.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Coffee Houses We were visiting our friends in Austin and we stopped in to grab coffeee. The parking lot was super busy too. We walked in and the coffee shop has a ton of room for people to meet up/study. I got the Chai latte and they make their own Chai which isn't as sweet as others. I really liked it and we sat to chat for a while.  If I was still a student in austin, I'd probably come by here to study. My student-self was looking at all the tables and outlets.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Cute location and relaxed feel if you want to get away and have a nice secluded conversation with a friend. Nice couches and plenty of tables for studying and enjoying all the lovely items Epoch has to offer.  Epoch served me my FIRST cappuccino and I'm HOOKED! Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second steeping on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again. I wish there were more laid back/spacious coffee houses in San Antonio! Austinites are SPOILED! My first cappuccino! Oh so good!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Great collection of espresso, don't forget to check out their tea selection! They have one with pecan, and it's just delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee, great location. Lots places to eat after. Had a  croissant that was fairly hard, so wasn't impressed with pastry selection. Study spot wise, it depends on the people working that day. There seems to always be louder music playing, and not the kind you can easily tune out, with certain people working. Genuine joes us better for studying on those days, even though its smaller.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Updated review Still love this place! We went in November when it was delightfully nice out and had a couple of vanilla lattes outside and it was really great.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee, tea, and good food.  I'm a big fan of East Side so I of course loved their pizza.  No issues with the staff or Internet.  The parking can be a little weird with the theater next door but that just means a bit further of a walk.  Ultimately the 5 stars come from the fact that there's nothing around it to compete.  Starbucks is ... well, you know.   Genuine Joe experiences have been mixed.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"""Service""? Hahaha. These baristas are the stereotypical holier-than-thou jerks people make jokes about. The coffee is fine, but personally I prefer not to patronize businesses where I'm clearly seen as an annoyance just for ordering.  The other location isn't much better. Starts at the top, I guess.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Not much for decoration or atmosphere... But this cup in front of me might be the best cup of coffee I have ever had.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Love finding coffee spots. After a disappointing dinner at Korea House, we headed over here for some tea. I ordered a Coconut Chai tea (only comes in a pot). The Barista was really friendly. I loved the cozy feeling of the area. Thanks Austin! Coconut chai tea",1
Coffee Shop 20,So much improvement!!! This place has totally turned it around since they opened. That was rocky. Now it's lovely. The staff is great it's clean. Drinks are on point. Great job guys. Oh and the bottled water helps support drug and alcohol recovery so that's awesome!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been a regular to Epoch for about a year now, so this review isn't based on one visit:  Pros: -Coffee is great. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good. -Staff is nice and smiles all around -Wifi is really dependable -Their tables are big! If you like to spread out when you study, come here. -Usually you can find a place to sit at the tables, bar or couch -Love the hipster atmosphere and artwork  Cons: -This place is COLD. I don't mean kind of chilly bring a sweater. I mean after one hour your fingers will be ice and you will be chilled to the bone despite wearing a peacoat. The best tables are lined up on the wall and the air conditioning blasts right on them. Sitting at a table that isn't on the wall helps but definitely doesn't solve the problem. Every time I come here I bring a sweater, but nine times out of ten I have to leave before I planned because I couldn't stand how cold I was. If you're a small or naturally cold person, DO NOT come here or plan to be here for more than 30 minutes. Earlier this morning it was 50 degrees outside and they still had the air conditioning on -- I left earlier than I wanted to.  I really want to like coming here, especially because it's so close to my place, but I just hate how cold it is.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"If you ever are looking to grab a cup of coffee you should give this place a try at least once. I have not had many things here as I feel the only thing I need is the Iced Mojo, but based purely on the Iced Mojo itself I highly recommend it. No need for creamer or sugar it is good to go!  The staff/employees do provide the service expected but do not go above and beyond.  Cozy environment, not as hipster as some of the Epochs closer to downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee- the baristas were great. I use to be a barista so when I get a taste of a good cup of black I really appreciate it. The energy seemed a bit lacking in the atmosphere this morning. But that could just be me, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been coming here for a few years now. They have a great selection of coffee and tea. It's pretty mellow in here so it's ideal for working or studying. Employees are pretty nice overall, hard to beat.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Pretty nice place here, very good environment for studying if you can in a coffee house environment. I got some coconut chai tea without milk and it cost around $4. The only complaint I would have was that after I finished the tea, there were these little bugs flying around and into my cup and it was a bit disgusting. Other than the fly problem, it was pretty good place and tea. The flies are an easy problem to get rid of. Coconut Chai Latte",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Just have to say that I stopped by Epoch because Genuine Joe doesn't understand the concept of staying open during their posted times and how that affects customer service.    So my g/f and I walk in and the place is packed, but the line is small.  Apparently this was the place to be on a Saturday night.  We walk up to the counter and the barista was super nice.  Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"4 check-ins That area needed a good coffeehouse and this was it. I was sick and tired of going to a coffeehouse which I'm going to name but I'll give you a hint - they have private events scheduled and they will kick you out of the room. Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot. If I'm in the area, this is where I'm going to get some good coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I like this place, even though I've recently sworn off caffeine (mostly). The service is nice and the selection of teas and snacks is good. I got a burnt (like, ""why did you think it was okay to put these ingredients into the tortilla?,"" burnt) breakfast taco, emailed them (nicely!) about it, and they gave me a gift card to apologize.  I do wish they could better control noise, and have more outlets for laptops, but if you go prepared with headphones and a full battery you'll enjoy your experience.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Love this place. I usually get the mocha with almond milk. Always good. They serve Tyson's breakfast tacos in the morning. Baristas are always friendly. Plenty of tables and wifi. Great spot to chill or get out of the office.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"I have been to this place a couple of times -- usually Saturday afternoons.  I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.  Overall, pretty good -- but definitely not the end all.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"292 check-ins My neighborhood was low on local coffee shops, so I was thrilled when Epoch opened a new location right around the corner. I like the original location ok, but this one suits my style a bit more. (Yeah, I know, I'm a bit of yuppie.) They also display local artists work.  There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back. The baristas are always friendly and willing to debate you on which Star Wars movie is best, plus they make a mean cortado.  NOTE: They FINALLY fixed that second door in the ladies room a couple months ago.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This place had a cute atmosphere, plenty of comfortable seating, extremely amiable staff, and just a generally pleasant place to work. Unfortunately I have to dock it for it's coffee though. I haven't tried everything, but the few drinks I've had were ok at best. I haven't tried the food or the tea so I'm not reviewing those, but I do wish the coffee were better. That being said, I like sweet drinks so if you don't, then you'll probably like it more than I did.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Edit: I left 30 minutes in because the music was so horrible and loud. It was old-timey country at first, but abruptly turned 80s alternative. The first song in that sequence was Buffalo Bob's transvestite song in ""Silence of the Lambs."" This is more of a place for people in their 30s or 40s.  First off, this is in a really cool little area. It's right next to Alamo Drafthouse on Anderson (which also means that parking is hopeless). It's part of a community of businesses centered around this leafy garden thing.  It's small, but not comfy. Lighting is poor, but people seem to be studying here with some success. The first two chairs I tried sitting in were wobbly/off-balanced. It's as hot as it is outside, but thankfully a little less humid. Unfortunately, I forgot my headphones, so I'm forced to listen to old-timey country. I probably won't be coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Good place. Got italian soda and fruit and hubby got the iced cappuicunio. Caramel sounds good.

Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp Challenge, Coffee addicts, step up! What the F is a cortado? I didn't know, so I ordered it. And surprisingly, I liked it. I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.  However, I like coffee, the W. Anderson Lane area, and Topo Chico :-)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost In comparison to the original Epoch, I'm a huge fan. There's parking, open tables, and light! And the bathroom doesn't scare you. High fives all around.  I'm still a fan of the other Epoch, but this one suites me a bit more. They offer Cuvee coffee and will brew it up via Chemex or Clever. The drip coffee is cheap, and refills are only $1. The mocha here is still good, but you can only go Mexican mocha. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups. There's some nice couch space  and bar seating here also. The wi-fi can be spotty though, so that's one knack on it.  Solid shop.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"My favorite coffee shop. Pros: lots of room, comfy seating, 2 very strong wifi networks, a patio, often good music is playing, like Jeff Buckley, instead of that horrible coffee house music you get in places Cons: pastry selection isn't very broad, dine-in cups are so wide that the coffee goes cold quickly",1
Coffee Shop 20,"So- I love coffee shops.  I especially love coffee shops with sofas ( really the only way to work). I love a barista that can make a really good latte. I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Circa13 is everything a coffee shop should be.  Plenty of places to sit and talk/work. Numerous power outlets, free WiFi and open until Midnight.  They brew up several local teas, Cuvee coffee and serve baked goods from Russell's Bakery. Also serve salad/sandwiches from 10AM-2PM for lunch but I haven't had the chance to try them yet.  Woohoo! As good as it gets! GABA Oolong Tea GABA Oolong See all photos from Dan B. for Epoch Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 20,"The service is nice. I tried a mocha from here, but it was pretty bland. I will give this place another try, but for now, I wouldn't recommend it.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"21 check-ins ROTD This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often. Presents for team Forest Family.",1
Coffee Shop 20,I love this place. The whole scene just rocks. And they are popping up all over town. Love it,1
Coffee Shop 20,"2 check-ins Not sure what the issue was with the staff before, but I had a wonderful visit.  The staff made a few great suggestions on drinks and tacos. Loved my Mexican Mocha and Yoda (veggie) taco.  Both were flavorful but not overpowering.  Nice rock music in the background,  really clean inside, and plenty of room to get some work done.  I'll definitely be back! The order counter. View from my table My Mexican Mocha",1

Coffee Shop 20,"Updated review My opinion of this coffee shop has declined somewhat since my original review.  A few notable bad experiences:  - Standing and waiting for the barista to serve me, even though there was no one else in line.  I had to finally say ""excuse me, can I get some service?"" to get said barista to do his job. -  Ordering a coffee, only to find -- they're out of coffee.  This has actually happened a few times.  I had to wait for them to brew a fresh batch. -  Some days, the coffee tastes like watered-down swill.  Other days, it's delicious.  This place happens to be right around the corner from where I work, so I keep giving it chances.  Wish the staff would get it together.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Four stars means that I liked it AND I'm coming back here preferentially when in the area :)  Because there are no coffeeshops in North Austin as awesome as Epoch and as accessible!  The coffee, tea, and food selection is good, but that's not why you come to Epoch!  You come here because you need some downtime, maybe on a couch, with some wifi and isolation.  Or you come here because you need a quiet place to chat with a friend or three.  Or you can come here to play games with folks.  It all works at Epoch.    I no longer have to drive 30 min to get to North Loop and Guadalupe--halleloo.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"10 check-ins Listed in Coffee Thursday This place is very different from the North Loop location, but not in a bad way. It's just different. There's lots of seating with 2 top tables, bar seating, and a section with couches and armchairs for relaxin'. When I got there, nobody was at the counter for me to order but he popped out from the back after a bit and apologized. Genuine smile, so, of course, he was forgiven.  I always get the Mexican mocha or an iced Mojo from Epoch so I got the Mexican mocha to see how this one compared to the original location. Crazy tasty!  This location has a more modern feel to it than the other location, which is nice...I like having diversity without having to sacrifice deliciousness! They'll get another star out of me when they increase they're bakery/food options! Can a girl get a danish or a piece of cake??",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Their iced mojo is amazing. The shop is spacious and the servers are wonderfully personable. I love this coffee shop.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"If their wifi was as dependably good as the coffee, it would be hard to ever pry me out. Love the back patio as long the smokers arent around!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Their espresso is vibrant and juicy, they insist relentlessly on quality ingredients, and I have never had a negative experience with any of the staff. I really like the wide space available and it is a calm, sedate place - not crammed with noisy meetings or unsupervised children. They have organic almond milk available! I really love coming here before work to focus my thoughts or work quietly on a project. It's amazing to be here in the early hours especially, and I love having this charming little space in the neighborhood.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I love this Epoch because I've never had to ""wait"" for a table to open to sit down. It's pretty spacious! I used to live in Far West and hated traveling a little further to my other favorite coffee shops.  I'm not a sucker for coffee but I enjoyed my almond milk iced lattes and hot teas!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"- Great place to study - Great Coffee - The customer service does not meet my expectations though.  This place is a great place to study or work on anything. There are a lot of tables that are available before the evening and is pack usually at night. When I came there, it was empty and there were several places to study. During this time, I didn't purchase anything yet. When it started to get more busier, one of the cashier or possibly owner walked towards my friend and I to tell us  ""This place is getting crowded, either get something or get out!"" I thought this was incredibly rude, but I do understand a business is a business. I would  appreciate it if he asked us if we wanted anything to drink. One good thing was that when I bought my drink, he apologized and that is something I appreciated.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins Amazing atmosphere, laid back and relaxing. Perfect for a little meetup, all alone study sesh, or just a simple sit in. Tried their iced americano and latte. Both are so refreshing and I ended up craving for even more. Don't even know a lot about coffee, but I know for sure I love their kind. Love this place!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"If you want to head here because you enjoy the original Epoch, don't bother. They get their pastries from a completely different vendor (I had a croissant that tasted like an undercooked pillsbury product) and I think the coffee is much worse. Plus, the vibe reads super snooty to me. I won't be returning.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?",1

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,Very cool decor! Good drinks Nice seating  However...  Just about everything is overpriced. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a cortado. No WiFi Music is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several tables were dirty when we got there. Service is average.  It feels like a Los Angeles coffee shot that is out of place.,0
Coffee Shop 66,"They are located within the Northcross mall shopping center facing east toward Burnet Rd with plenty of parking. I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group.

Coffee Shop 66,"Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado",1
Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again.

Coffee Shop 66,"Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets.

There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good.

Coffee Shop 66,"Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought, just a cafe with a couple of food options. The Nutella waffles we got were on point - there's also a chicken option.  The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options. I hope they add more items to the menu! Milk tea - humongous!! Nutella banana waffles Love the illustrations! See all photos from Ramya B. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,"The greeting of an atmosphere it feels I created. This place speaks to my free spirited soul, with matcha lattes, swings inside that still fit in, pillows, and waffles. This might be the next artist home where computers aren't encouraged by the architecture, but books, talking and chess are. Matcha latte with lactose free milk and house book",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Craft coffee drinks, tea, and beer/wine. Friendly staff, good music and nice atmosphere complete with with a few rope swings from he ceiling. And let's not forget the amazing waffles!! Nice place to chill with friends.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated prices and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Guys, this place is amazing. Limited food menu but both waffle offerings will blow you away! Crazy good spices on the chicken. The coffee and matcha were both stellar as well. Service was friendly and efficient. The space is stunning and cozy. Highly recommend. Will be my new go-to relaxation spot in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks. Highly recommended, so get here when you can!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is amazing! No wifi, but that's fine. it's meant to be a place to hang out with friends, socialize or by yourself reading a good book!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I never write Yelp reviews, ever. But when I walked in here it felt like I was in a hipster Alice in wonderland. The decor is spot on and they left no details out. The Marymint Monroe is really amazing and the chicken and waffle is really good. The staff is so wonderful too, you could tell they really love what they're doing. The swings are a nice touch too!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit. You will want to try their swing for sure. Seating space is somewhat limited and no wifi is available, so be aware. This is more like a place for you to enjoy its atmosphere. Drinks were good, though make sure you have enough in your bank account because their drinks are probably not for broke college students. That swing!",1
Coffee Shop 66,I really enjoyed my visit here. I ordered the cortado and chicken waffle. Both were excellent.  The space is very Instagram worthy.  Awesome mural. Staff was very friendly too and I loved the iPad ordering system. Chicken waffle and cortado paired with sparkling water to cleanse the palate,1
Coffee Shop 66,"7 check-ins The Factory Cafe is overall such a beautiful and really cool place to just hang out with friends or work on homework. You'll probably see the people around you taking the time to perfect their aesthetic Instagram pictures and Snapchat stories (myself included). Although the cafe itself doesn't provide wifi, it's within range of other places with wifi so that shouldn't deter you from going! This place looks like it literally came straight off of Pinterest! So cute!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"My only complaint and desire and heart wish is for this place to be open longer and to allow for Wifi. This place makes my heart happy, it motivates me to study because I want to come here, and it makes me wish I had time to settle and read a wonderful book. The atmosphere is PERFECT, the workers are GENEROUS AND KIND, it's a beautiful place to be.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces. Golden age of milk tea See all photos from Khang H. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!  This place has homemade pop tarts!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is really nice. They have done a great job... It's the type of place that you could spend hours in. They have a small menu right now, but their drinks, waffles, and pastries are really well made. We'll definitely be coming back soon.... like tomorrow. Viva Matcha Latte and Pop-art",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I got waffle wasted at The Factory!!! Not your average coffee shop! Super social without wifi, novel idea!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Honestly, this place is having an identity crisis. Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute decor (props to the designer), but music is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed art of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay open till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a beer/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the owners will rethink their direction. Would I come back? Eeh, too many other treats to entice my attention.",0
Coffee Shop 66,Marymint Monroe  + Chicken and waffles samich = my favorite cafe in Austin.  ... Ohhh and decor is pretty sweet too,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Cute, eclectic furniture and lots of things to do! Gorgeous seating vignettes, lots of space, classy decor. Only thing to watch out for--no wifi...not really a place to do work or study, but great place to chill! My friends and I (6 of us total) found space to play a board game, and had a blast!",1
Coffee Shop 66,This place is fantastic! Ideal place for grabbing a frothy matcha latte and a chicken & waffle. A bit different in the way that you order. Definitely a nice hang-out for millenials or anyone who works in the area and is on a lunch break. Wifi is within reach but they don't have it themselves.,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Enthusiastic and earnest desire to be excellent, try new things and develop new menu ideas, smiles, not in your face - best almond pound cake I've ever had (worth the 5 stars alone), and a fantastic cup of red rooibos iced tea.  next to Hanabi.  fantastic new spot.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"The factory is gonna be my new coffee spot. No words can describe the Amazing atmosphere upon walking in. Comfortable seating, hip music, great interior finishes and table games. The intuitive ipad ordering system was quite fascinating as well with its ease of use. Great service and tastes great! Great job!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love this place. I really appreciate the lack of wifi. Makes it much easier to have good conversations or lose yourself in a good book. Agree that it's a bit pricey, but the drinks are really good.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Great coffee, food and atmosphere! Love the set-up. Order on an iPad and they call your name out when your food is ready.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Super cute place for lounging and chatting up with a friend. The chicken and waffle was delicious. Chicken was cooked to perfection! Super moist chicken with fluffy waffle...more of a snack than a meal, so don't go here expecting to be filled with a meal.",1
Coffee Shop 66,First time checking this place out first time. Pretty swag. Nice assortment of drinks. I got the 15 minutes of fame. Also got the poptart. Delicious!  Next time I'll try the Marymount Monroe. Will definitely come back soon.,1
Coffee Shop 66,"The matcha lattes are amazing! Great atmosphere, great food and drink, and everything is plated beautifully. The kind of place where you can tell the employees take pride in their work. I'll definitely be back often.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"First to Review The Factory is AWESOME! What a great spot! I had the chicken and waffles (new take, but I now have cravings for them!), the homemade Poptart was so fun and such a delight. In terms of beverages got the drink with the chicory in it (I'm a big chicory fan) and it was perfect!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This spot is super cute (""like eating in a Pottery Barn""), with drinks that are unique and with a somewhat limited menu. We tried the chicken and waffles, which was surprisingly delicious and our drinks were also tasty. I had the Livin La Vida Mocha and my husband had the pour over. I will definitely return with company, but prices weren't good enough to make this a regular stop in our rotation.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love the Factory. Good coffee, tasty chicken and waffles and awesome atmosphere. Definitely recommend the Nutella waffle.",1
Coffee Shop 66,AMAZING atmosphere! I walked around for 5 minutes looking at everything before even ordering.  Most unique take on chicken and waffles I've ever had. Hands down best night time hangout in North Austin. P.S.... their Matcha Latte is to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"I am very impressed with this place. The food portions were so perfect and not mention delicious! The waffle architects (staff) were all so accommodating and nice. We were able to talk to one of the owners for a bit and he was very helpful with his recommendations and accurate. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back when I am in Austin again. Nutella and Banana waffles. Chicken and Waffles, Olive Oil Pound Cake, and Milk Tea! Yummy.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful art.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very expensive for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.",0
Coffee Shop 66,Amazing coffee! Waffle banana and nutella is incredible! Beautiful place! The service is great! Everything is just perfect!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"The cafe is beautiful, the coffee was fantastic and very well presented, and the food was delicious. Must try!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Best coffee joint downtown! The Ethiopian pour over is amazing, my friend had a dirty chai and it was also one of the best chai lattes I've ever had. The staff here is really friendly and knowledgeable. For a large dirty chai and a small pour over was $10. Not too bad for the quality and level of service you're getting. This is close to my work so I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"My office is literally right across the street from this spot.  Good luck in finding a menu here. The baristas are SNOBS! '0' customer service skills. All in all, the coffee is EXCELLENT any day and any time of day.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Cool, smooth, hipster coffee in Austin.  As customary to any vacation we go on, I try to find a hipster coffee place to go to- mostly because, well, I like my coffee (I think someday, it may give me an ulcer, but until then, I'll continue to drink it.)  After spending a few hours in the Texan sun (which definitely drained me), a nice cup of refreshing coffee sounded good.  We stopped by Houndstooth- a modern hipster place. I got the Japanese style iced coffee- I've had it before, and was pleased that it was offered here.  It was smooth and refreshing- and to my standards, I did not have to add milk/cream of any sort, - meaning the aftertaste was light and worth drinking black.  I'm sure they have even better hot coffees, but it was still a great stop while being in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I absolutely LOVE coffee and I love real coffee. None of that artificial pumpkin spice frap for me. If you enjoy really good coffee and drink lattes or cold brew, then this is the place for you. I ordered a latte and my boyfriend got an iced caffe Americano. Both were amazing!  If you're looking for the location, it is attached to the Frost Bank in Downtown Austin, but there is plenty of room inside to grab a seat, sip on coffee, and browse your computer. The cashier was super friendly and they did have a nice, clean bathroom inside that required a key. Iced latte & Iced caffe Americano.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth serves not only amazing coffee, but some tasty breakfast burritos from Tacodeli too. The coffee here is awesome. The Japanese style iced where they brew a single cup over ice may be a bit pricey, but the flavor is just so good. The staff is great as well and super friendly and knows their way around a tasty cup of coffee. The space is pretty open and has good light, so it's a perfect place for doing some work with your coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"At houndstooth your not coming for you average cup of coffee. When you enter the building there's an open space to sit. The coffee is good and their baristas are really friendly and good at their jobs. This is the best coffee place I've been in a while. If you want a good cup if Joe, I would recommend this place without hesitation Getting some good brew",1
Coffee Shop 32,Excellent code and the staff were very warm and receptive...   Always stop in when I'm in town,1
Coffee Shop 32,"We stumbled upon Houndstooth while exploring DT Austin. It is at the base of the Frost Tower, one of the nicest buildings in DT Austin.  The cafe has plenty of room and seating, great vibe and friendly baristas. A cool setting outside the houndstooth to sit and enjoy your coffee.  They have a pretty interesting variety of coffee. We had Cortado and brewed Coffee. Our drinks were well balanced, smooth and delicious . It is  definitely the place for you if you're a coffee snob!  Some of the speciality drinks are pricier. But it's a treat!  If I am in the area, I would duck in to try other specialities. See all photos from Shruthi B. for Houndstooth Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Love their highly curated tea selection. The hibiscus rooibos is a favorite. Bright, tart, and a little funky.  Also, the baristas are very knowledge and quite friendly.  An extra plus for good wifi, and a very slight minus for a small pastry selection.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"It's everything you want in a serious coffee bar. They weigh their shots, they use great quality beans and they've got a selection of pastries or tacos. If you want a real espresso/coffee experience, look no further.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"As avid coffee drinkers we always appreciate milk steamed to perfection and some smooth, potent espresso. We visited Houndstooth coffee twice on our trip to Austin, and I am very glad we did. We were offered the choice between two different espresso beans when we ordered, and the baristas were always spot on when interpreting and explaining the flavors. We also got the blueberry muffin and the blueberry scone, and they were good! Would highly recommend this coffee place.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great atmosphere, lots of seating. Internet is quality and works perfectly. I had an americano and is was perfectly rich and not too much water. It's at the base of the Frost Bank Tower, which is a great location right in downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Great coffee - had a couple of well needed quality Macchiatos after several bad brews elsewhere.  Wifi was a little sketchy today but they more than made up for it with a cracking 80/90s playlist that oozed good vibes all afternoon.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins We were on the hunt, the hunt for smoked, charred meat from the pits of the masters of Austin, but first we need 'feine in our veins so that we would have the energy for our trek. We found Houndstooth and well, fate had our cards played right as our Barista's name was... Austin!!! C'mon now, that's pretty amazing! As Austin noticed Roland L's GGET cap, he nervously extracted our espressos expertly. Our Java was quite amazing, smooth and delicious. Why only 4 stars, well, our second trip by a different barista scored a lot lower, more like a 3.5. Goes to show you that if you are in Austin at a coffee shop and get your drinks pulled by a guy named Austin, that equates to some special times! Almond Croissant and Cortado Cortado",1
Coffee Shop 32,This is a nice spot right in downtown Austin.  We were looking for a place to grab a quick cup and relax a bit while we planned out our day.  This hit the spot.  I grabbed a nicely executed pour-over and spent a few minutes chatting with the barista.  He was incredibly friendly and well informed.  I always enjoy talking coffee with other coffee geeks.  I feel like I always learn something.  Prices were right in line with what you'd expect for high end coffee and I would certainly stop back here the next time I am in town.,1
Coffee Shop 32,3 check-ins Round 1: The cold brew doesn't really compare in strength or flavor to the one at Ruckus but it was okay.  Round 2: The almond milk latte (while overpriced for 12oz) is superior.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Keep Austin Delicious Houndstooth is a bit hard to find due to the address, but once you get there, it's worth it for the well-made coffee as well as to see hipster Austin in action. The entrance is actually on the corner of 4th and Congress. Once you walk in, you see a bunch of artist types on laptops, a large and clean interior, and indie music playing on a countertop speaker. They have all sorts of coffee options as well as breakfast food items. They even do Japanese cold brew, though I went with the regular. They also have a bunch of tea options, if you're into that. Coffee menu Tea menu",1
Coffee Shop 32,"The baristas here are super knowledgeable about coffee.  If I had time to drink-in I would have tried the interesting sounding ginger espresso drink of the day with decaf espresso, but that was a drink-in exclusive and I needed to go to a meeting.  I also asked about their teas but they're mostly high caffeine.  So I went with a decaf latte.  I can respect that some coffee houses want to have only natural sweeteners.  All that they had out was raw sugar.  But, I really need to avoid adding sugar for health reasons, so I would have preferred to have my sweeteners of choice available (Splenda or Stevia).  Since I had no choice I used the sugar and it took a whole lot of raw sugar to sweeten the latte to even a fraction of the sweetness I usually enjoy.  I try not to think of how much sugar that was.  But, it tasted good.  If I lived nearby and could keep a box of splenda on my desk, I'd be happy to get coffee from here again and sweeten it myself.  Unfortunately since I'm only here on business, I'm better off sticking to the generally inferior Starbucks so I can have coffee w/o tons of sugar and have it be at the sweetness that I like.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Best of Austin The coffee is great! I had a beautiful and delicious cortado and my friend had a soy latte. Definitely the place for you if you're a coffee snob! They even list their available espressos so that you can choose your favorite!  They also have pretty and tasty pastries! We chose the fresh strawberry sweet tart and the almond croissant! Yum.  They have a refrigerator of sandwiches as well - made by the Greencart!  Seating inside and out!  So, yes, it's pricy. I wouldn't get my coffee here everyday, but it's an awesome treat!!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Just another coffee shop in Austin, nothing special about the shop. The latte isn't the best that I had, but I was still able to drink it. Vanilla Latte",1
Coffee Shop 32,Stumbled upon this coffee place while exploring DT Austin. Their coffee Popsicle sounded interesting and it's the perfect treat for this Austin heat! :) Their coffee is delicious as well. Coffee Popsicle,1
Coffee Shop 32,"I didn't know this place existed until last Monday. It's convenient if you live or work downtown. Pretty hopping, and they keep the line moving. My friend's coffee was delightful and I was able to watch my bicycle from the window. (I forgot the key to my bike lock, so that was imperative). Although it's not as comfortable as some of my favorite coffee places, I'll have good vibes about this place forever because we had such a productive meeting.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Ginger in the Snow was delicious. It is their seasonal drink and will only have it for a few more weeks.  It tasted like a creme Brulee espresso.  It wasn't too sweet which I was worried about.    Tacodeli is available and I highly recommend the mashed potatoes, cheese and egg mini burrito. Ginger in the snow and tacodeli",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Came here while wondering the streets of Austin alone one morning. Had the centro americano, iced espresso honey cinnamon rice milk plum and lemon I believe? It did not disappoint! Would definitely come back for the same drink! Plus super friendly service and a nice calm atmosphere. Happy girl! Centro Americano, love the presentation, love the flavor!",1
Coffee Shop 32,Thank god!  There is good coffee in Austin!  I'm a big coffee snob from Seattle and have a professional grade machine at home.  When traveling for work I rarely find good coffee. But I did here!  Yay! If you want the sugary sweet flavored stuff drenched in whip chream go somewhere else.  This place is for who love the art and flavor of good coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth is really the best coffee shop.  The coffee is amazing, which already makes it fantastic.  And then you add on the fact that they have great pastries AND that they sell Tacodeli breakfast tacos, and it's mind-blowing.  You can't get better than this.",1
Coffee Shop 32,People are nice and latte was delicious.  They had a blueberry hibiscus ice tea that was tasty too.  Nice place to just hang out and talk.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"It's a cute place & just stumbled by this place while we were walking around the night before, wanted to try a cool local place besides Starbucks.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Place is ok, kinda hot to the point you would notice it and get you uncomfortable, when asked the stuff about it he replied in a way like its their normal, hope in the winter they have good heater to keep the place warm:), their menu missing many items, not blender, so any drink require blending they wont have it, they have coffee, latte, snacks, also freg. with water and soda.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"Begrudgingly I came here to meet a friend who was in town for SXSW. This was because Medici Cafe was closed for Grumpy Cat. While it was very, very crowded, we got our drinks quickly and efficiently. I had an iced chai latte and it was perfect. I absolutely hate it when coffee houses make it too sweet. My drink had a nice balance of sweet, spicy and savory all in one sip.  My friend and I did manage to snag a place on their patio. If I was in the area again, I'd duck in and get another chai.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Austin City Limits I was mesmerized watching our barista make our pour-over coffees.  It was like it was effortless for him, but at the same time, you could see the level of attention that went into making each cup.  I am not someone who drinks coffee daily, so when I do, it's a real treat.  Houndstooth did not disappoint.  Grab a seat at the bar if you can so you can get the full experience and chat with the employees.  They're really friendly and they're clearly passionate about what they're making.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Such a great place with excellent espresso & rad baristas. I love you all for supporting my caffeine addiction,1
Coffee Shop 32,Fabulous coffee and a great outdoor patio in downtown Austin. It's all about coffee here so no eats that I could see. Winding down the day with good coffee,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Very friendly baristas. I had the cold brew, and it was a little weaker than my usual taste, but still greater. The self service station for sugar or milk was very small and only served 1 person at a time. There was not even room to put my coffee down. The station also only has raw sugar, which is great to add to coffee, but does not dissolve at all for colder mixes. Nevertheless, the baristas were very great and refilled the half and half container as soon as they spotted me. She even went looking for me after she refilled it since I returned to my table. I was lucky enough to come before the rush, but the line can be 10-15 people long as quite the wait it seems. It was a great atmosphere to work though, and fun to enjoy while maintaining productivity.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I loved the black tea. I usually purchase coffee, but it was too hot so the tea was refreshing.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"4 check-ins Exquisite iced latte.  Nice meeting spot.  Located at 4th and Congress - Google maps lies!  Also, a spartan pastry selection, but killer organic breakfast burritos.  The ""Vaquero"" burrito was awesome.  A nice light bite.  I was watching them foam milk for other orders and the attention to detail was borderline OCD.  The guy pouring the milk in the coffee acted like he was mixing nitroglycerin.  Each pour was perfect and artisanal.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Had a decent experience at Houndstooth (Downtown location). They only had one barista working, and the line got pretty long. It was pricey for what we got. I was very pleased with the Counter Culture bean she recommended. Would recommend anyone to go visit. Sweet set up at Houndstooth! Counter culture clever.",1
Coffee Shop 32,I found this place off Yelp since I was visiting from Dallas and I love it. I asked one of the baristas about coffee sustainability for a class project and he was super informative and willing to give me the information I needed. Super friendly staff and awesome atmosphere! I'd visit this place again next time I'm in Austin. Cuppuccino and chai!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great almond cappuccino, convenient location downtown, free wifi that works pretty well, and really darling interior design. The staff was helpful and welcoming, and I love the cute designs on the cups.  A great place to work, grab some coffee, and people-watch downtown. Texas cappuccino cups!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in ACL-Less Austin Hidden in the Frost Tower between Congress Ave. and 5th St. is perhaps one of the best coffees I have tasted! I personally thought Houndstooth Coffee was comparable to Intelligentsia Coffee I had in Chicago and New York, so I was so happy that I can still get heavenly coffee without going out of my beloved state of Texas.  Whether you are coming here for a study session or a short coffee break, Houndstooth is perfect. The shop gives off a relaxing vibe that is great for hanging out for any length of time. Expect not only great coffee from Houndstooth but also great service in this super chill shop! If you love coffee, you cannot miss the opportunity to grab a cup here! Tastes as beautiful as it appears The one and only!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"3 check-ins Fantastic coffee made with love and care. The baristas are wonderful, the ambience is pretty and modern. It gets packed in the mornings, so pplan accordingly to stand in line. It's worth the wait.  Also, breakfast tacos! Thank god for a place that understands sometimes you don't want to choose between good coffee and a protein rich breakfast. It can be hard to exist on a muffin all morning, coffee shops! A one stop shop where I can get delicious eggs in the morning and a great coffee is a place I'll end up being a regular.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Mmmmmm Houndstooth. What can I say, they have a great selection of coffee beans and you can pretty much choose whatever type of preparation you'd like (pour overs, espressos, you name it). Breakfast tacos are also pretty clutch here.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Clear Eyes, Full Stomachs, Can't Lose Unless you're looking for it, Houndstooth Coffee is hard to find. It's tucked back off of Congress, inside the Frost Bank Tower. Once inside, you'll find yourself in a bright shop that does coffee right and pays tribute to its home state with cute Texas cups.  I didn't linger; I only stayed long enough to scarf down a strong cortado and savory pecan scone post-run. For a recharge like this, Houndstooth is perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Delicious coffee and breakfast tacos and friendly baristas, what else could someone want.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I found this place pretty late in my week-long trip to Austin, and I ended up visiting several times. I tried the iced coffee, espresso, and pour-over, and all three were the best I had in Austin.  I'm not sure what brewing method they used for the iced coffee, but it tasted like cold brew -- low in acidity. I liked it significantly better than the one I had at Dominican Joe (which is also a competent coffee shop).  The espresso shot was sweet, and a little tart without getting into the silly levels of sourness that so many 'cool' coffee shops seem so fond of.  The pour-over was a delicious Burundi, roasted by North Carolina's Counter Culture Coffee, and brewed on a Kalita Wave. (The Aeropress madness seems to have mostly bypassed Austin.) This was my favorite of the three drinks.  I did not try the milk drinks, but I did see them make a latte, and the milk appeared to be correctly steamed and poured.  Houndstooth is a multi-roaster cafe; in addition to Counter Culture, I saw beans from PT's Coffee (Kansas), and some Texan roaster whose name escapes me.  In addition to coffee, they have Taco Deli breakfast tacos, the usual coffee shop pastries, and I think I saw loose leaf teas. Prices were maybe a shade higher than similar shops in Seattle, with the espresso shot running closer to $3 than $2.  Note: this place is nearly invisible if you're walking down Congress, unless you're specifically looking for it (which you should be). It's in the southwest corner of the Frost Tower, with the main entrance on Congress, and a side door on 4th.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I understand that Houndstooth wants to make a big deal about how over the top artisanal their brewing techniques are, but guys: if you are going to take 15 minutes to make a single cup of coffee, then get more baristas on shift.  It certainly doesn't feel like much of a privilege to stand around in an inexplicably un-airconditioned shop (seriously. is it broken or is having no a/c part of your campaign for street cred?) sweating and blearily watching some nervous kid do prayers and gyrations over steeping coffee for the better part of 30 minutes.  I get and appreciate the careful preparation of a quality product, but I feel that Houndstooth has overshot the mark and landed in Portlandia territory.  Houndstooth is fully equal, coffee-wise, to their competitors, yet they are more of a hassle, and more expensive.  Why would I ever do this to myself again?  Also, it seems hilarious and ironic that Houndstooth's logo is the fedora.  Have you people been on the internet in the last 5 years?  To many, the fedora is a concise symbol of tacky self-importance and tone deafness.  Hmm...",0
Coffee Shop 32,"First time in this coffee place while visiting Austin during SxSW. I ordered an iced coffee, which was a cold brew. The coffee was not too strong with still a slight hint of acidity. Since it was cold brew coffee, it tasted very different from iced coffee prepared in the traditional way with hot water. Give it a try if you want a different experience from regular ice coffee. You may like it.  The barista at the counter was extremely nice and patient when I asked about how the coffee was prepared, etc.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant and relaxing. The place looks spacious with large windows facing the street. You can get a pretty good outside view from the inside. There is also an outside sitting area where you can buy drinks directly. It is a good place to take a break after a nice walk in downtown Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Even if Houndstooth had great coffee (they don't... after having 3 other people try the Japanese iced coffee I just ordered and watched them share my retch-faced reaction I can safely say the barista has no idea what he's doing and the $5 funny tasting brown water thing went into the trash)... The shop itself is one of the most unwelcoming businesses I've ever been to. On this 3rd and final attempt to give the shop a fair shake, we were left feeling like every employee was burdened by our wanting to order coffee. Austin is better than this.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"We had a great breakfast here of lattes and breakfast tacos (a la carte from Tacodeli). Also got a great recommendation from one of the baristas for a brewery to check out, which really made my dad. Five stars for sure! My only disappointment was that I didn't get one of the mugs with Texas on the outside. Oh well.",1
Coffee Shop 32,So I just started working around the corner from this place and this is my first stop in. When I walked in the place was completely dead two customers at tables. Then I realized that I was walking in to the shop two minutes before they closed. To most establishments this would be an absolute nightmare of a situation. The barista greeted me warmly and very excepting and was more than happy to dirty some of the equipment that was already clean for a customer who was still coming in during business hours. He then even struck up a nice conversation with me while he was making a few coffees that I ordered as they were shutting down. Well done and you have just gotten yourself another regular! Not to mention the drinks were fantastic!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"If you are looking for a place to get a break from the outdoor heat, have a cup of delicious coffee, some iced water - go there! Plenty of room, outlets, tables, outside sitting area, really nice vibe and friendly baristas.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"3 check-ins Easy to find once you know it's there, tucked back along the side to the entrance of Frost Bank.  Was excited to see Houndstooth has another location.  I suppose I am a bit of a coffee geek, and Houndstooth knows what they are doing.  They have an extensive training they put their baristas through, and they are very well versed in the beans they have on ""tap"".  True baristas are artists, they really can make a great coffee taste bad if they aren't familiar with the bean and conditions.  I was lucky to be able to join the Coffee Geekery event via Yelp that occurred here.  It was my first coffee cupping in the US.  Great way to try a variety of quality coffees and meet the people behind what makes Houndstooth unique.  You will never taste the same thing twice, as the coffee here changes, as it should.  It was nice to come out of the class learning a couple of things.  I liked their new sister label Tweed.  If you like a quality cup, and want to know more about what you are drinking, this is the place to come. See all photos from Mindy H. for Houndstooth Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Great espresso; as a stand alone shot, iced latte, and in a cappuccino. Barista really knew what he was doing and nicely and knowledgeably answered a couple questions! We enjoyed the outdoor patio as well.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Barista totally skipped over me for my order.  I politely inserted myself that I was ahead of the person behind me.  Rather than apologizing, she claimed the line got jumbled.   There was no question there was a clear line and I was next in line.  Rude!",0
Coffee Shop 32,Great Americano and fast service.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"This was the best coffee I had during my short visit to Austin. I had their more expensive expresso option, so maybe that is why. I really like the design of the place too. The only real drawback that I can think of is that it is inside a stale office building downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Delicious coffee, friendly baristas, chill spot with a nice vibe. There literally isn't anything wrong with this place and if I had more time I would have loved to do some work here. P.S. I'm in love with the adorable logo!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Dang! Hot damn! Wowza! This place is good. Very knowledgable staff. Interested in the learning the flavors you like before giving you just the pour of the day. This makes it a special experience, that it was brewed just for you. I'm a dirty chai kinda girl and they make one of the best in town. Nonetheless, they have lots of coffees to choose from. No matter your taste preference, they've got ya covered.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins Nice coffee shop on Lamar next to Uchiko and now one downtown.  Pretty well made coffees with the perfect touch of crema on the espresso shots and baristas who know what they are doing.   They carry stuff from Counter culture and Madcap and it is always interesting to taste an espresso there and then rush over to other places (literally with all that caffeine..) and try it again there.    The nice thing is that they also offer a small variety of non-dairy alternatives for the vegetarians among us.  I particularly like the coffee with mint and a splash of selzer (I think that's their eponymous specialty) which is quite refreshing in the summer.  All in all, a pretty good place to swing by for caffeine or downers in form of beer and wine.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Awesome location.  The wood counter tops are fab...as are the cups and the coffee!   Great people working here too.  I was impressed the girl who made my cappuccino knew most of the people in there by name!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"While there are several locations, the location I tried was on the first floor of the Frost office building on Congress Ave, on a corner. It is small and sophisticated, and reminds me a lot of my favorite coffee shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan called Sweetwater Coffee. I don't drink coffee so I had the hot chocolate, which was made with real cocoa. When I complimented the wood bar, the barista told me that the bar, tables, and floor were all made from one pecan tree.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Excellent Vanilla Latte and Awesome experience!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Best Coffee Shops I have been at Houndstooth only twice but it is quickly becoming my go-to place when in downtown Austin.  The coffee shop is in the lobby of the iconic Frost tower, but is quite comfortable and not too corporate. There is even a nice outdoor sitting area.  The baristas are friendly and know what they are doing. The coffee is always exceptional. Their espresso machine is beautiful. This is clearly a shop run by people who know and love good coffee.  As always, I like to try a cortado or a macciato. It was so good that i had to ask for a second one. There are many good coffee shops in downtown Austin, Houndstooth is clearly one of the best.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Houndstooth is well lit, good coffee, and plays 90s and 2000s hip hop & rap classics by artists like DMX, Tupac, Nelly, etc.  Sound like your jam?  This came well recommended by a friend so went here twice during my short stint in ATX. They serve Counter Culture coffee, so it's as local as you can get.  Location is odd/tucked in, but this is 2015 and y'all have Google Maps, so I'm not worried about that.  My only hesitation here is no almond milk offerings, little snacks/pastries, and price ($4.60 for a latte).",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I went to have breakfast today but found out is a coffee shop. The coffee made up for not getting what I was looking for. I ordered a capuchino because I like strong coffee and a raspberry tea cake. Oh well, a different type of breakfast. Great atmosphere and service.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Came here each day we were in Austin. Great service and love their chai tea!,1
Coffee Shop 32,"I love this place--it's not nearly as difficult to find a seat as at the original location on Lamar, but they need to get a Roomba or something--it's kind of gross how much dirt has accumulated in the corners.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I'm a huge coffee fan.  Austin has a bunch of coffee shops so you can imagine my excitement and list of coffee shops for this trip. My love for coffee is not always the coffee alone. I actually love going to coffee shops, especially ones with lots of uniqueness and characters to it. Ones that don't try to hard and have down to earth baristas that can teach you a thing or two about coffee, like this Houndstooth location.  Hidden behind a bookstore, Houndstooth is a very tiny shop. We couldn't locate it from the main street. We were greeted by the most awesome girl. She had blonde hair, a great style, and super friendly. She moved from Oakland to Austin a couple years ago (hi girl!).  She was very helpful and helped add to our list of things to see/do. The coffee itself was great. The aroma was wonderful and taste great.  I recommend grabbing your cup of joe from this shop if you are in the area!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"First time ever coming here! It was a really nice place to catch up with some friends, and a very sophisticated looking location. I had the Japanese ice coffee which is a summer special and it was really good! The service was great, and the staff were very friendly and easy to make conversation with. I want to try hanging out at the Lamar location next time I get a chance, but this one is closer to the heart of downtown and UT!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Five Star Hotness, Austin, TX This is a very happy place for me.  I was working at a venue for SXSW across the street and the 18 hour work days were long. When there was anywhere between 5 -20 minutes of a break, you bet your bottom dollar I was here.  It's really quite simple if you ask me why!  Well, the clean lines of the coffee shop made my wannaknowmore about interior design heart skip a beat. The company around seemed to be all young professionals working comfortable on laptops or reading.  The coffee was full and rich - oh my gosh. There are plenty of options no matter what kind of coffee drinker you are.  Best part? The baristas. They were consistently kind - like genuinely kind and truly cared you got the right drink for you.  This is my new favorite coffee spot in Austin. What what!",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Nice spacious interior made mostly of wood which leads to a fairly calming atmosphere. I tried the El Pital hand brew. The taste was dark and smoky. Very smooth, like quaint slow drifting jazz.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"I work pretty close to this coffee shop, so whenever me and one of our co-workers want to grab a coffee and have a talk we go there. Their coffee is super strong and I really love it. In the summer I mostly had their iced tea which was very good as well. The place is also very cute and the staff is super friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 32,I'm not a coffee drinker but their hot chocolate is excellent. I like it with soy milk. Great ambiance too.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Caffeine Boost Huge fan of this Houndstooth location. The space is much larger, and the colors are warmer than its counterpart on N. Lamar, but you get the same, excellent coffee.  You can choose between the aeropress and the clever dripper as your method of choice, and you can still pick between two different beans. Gregory, the barista working at the time, was really friendly, and I also saw him patiently (and excitedly) explain the different coffee choices to others who came in. Kudos to you!  What I did love about this location is the atmosphere. It's very bright and open with plenty of seating. I came on a Saturday, which is typically less busy than the rest of the week since the usual business crowd aren't working.  There are only two cons to this location for me: 1) It's downtown, so you're gonna have to pay for parking. 2) They have keys for the bathrooms here - I hate it when coffee shops do this, it's like begging for germs to be spread since people don't always wash their hands. The baristas will touch these keys as well..I hope they get cleaned. This is me being a germaphobe.  As a stand alone shop, for sure one of the best in Austin. Prices are higher than other places in Austin, but you get quality.",1
Coffee Shop 32,5 check-ins Houndstooth. Can't really find a better cup of coffee. Great decor/atmosphere.  Tacodeli breakfast tacos if you get there early enough.  So really why wouldn't you go cop a cup??,1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Review Challenge, Keep Austin Weird Saw the consistently high ratings on the interwebz and decided to visit this place during SXSW and was blown away.  The location is good (downtown), coffee good, plus they make a very rare drink (that very few places out of Australia and NZ make) known as the ""Flat White"".  Would definitely make this my regular spot when I'm back in Austin for my yearly SXSW visit :)",1
Coffee Shop 32,2 check-ins Very neat coffee shop. Wonderful coffee. It is two steps away from being pretentious. I'm sure it will maintain the balance. Cool vibe.,1
Coffee Shop 32,Great coffee. I'm from Nashville and we had an off day on tour and we hit this shop up 2 times in 1 day!  The 1st time I got a Cortado and the 2nd I got a drip. The Cortado was on point!!  Killer espresso Machine!  Good vibes and good times at this spot.,1
Coffee Shop 32,"Wifi was fast and the coffee was delicious! Even though it was busy, I received my drink very quickly and was able to find a seat to sit and get some work done. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 32,Super tasty banana bread. Great atmosphere with a mix of business people and creative types. Try and get a seat outside on the terrace. Yum,1
Coffee Shop 32,"I stumbled upon this place while hiking to a venue for SXSW. The logo is so cute on the mugs. I loved how they had Stumptown coffee. The seating area consisted of a bench, bar area, and tables with short stools. Super friendly staff and good music.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Stereotypical pretentious, overpriced coffee place, full of yuppies. I got two ""medium"" iced lattes (they only do one size and it's very small and only has two shots), an extra shot in each, and a kind bar and the total came to over $16. Wtf??!! I was on a fifteen minute break from work and had already waited in a long line, so I just had to bite the bullet and pay. Also the main barista was completely ridiculous. Every time I asked him a question like ""Is that a medium?"" or ""How many shots come in it?"" he'd give me some condescending response (without even looking up at me) like ""I only do one size,"" ""I always do two shots,"" as if I should've researched all of the Houndstooth policies before coming in. Don't get me wrong, the espresso was good, but not at all worth the wait, the nauseating service, or the price. Also I'm really confused as to why it keeps getting described as ""cozy."" It's pretty basic, just normal tall tables and chairs. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I have no idea why it has four stars when there are a bunch of other good, drama-free cafes in the immediate area.",0
Coffee Shop 32,"Some of the friendliest baristas you'll find around here! Espresso is fantastic and they offer two different single origin coffees at a time. I got a cortado with their Tweed beans (Colombia) and the chocolatey notes became more distinct the longer I drank it. They sell Askinosie chocolate, a small bean-to-bar single origin chocolate, which is great for pairing. The coffee shop offers indoor and outdoor seating and readily accessible.  Also the bathroom keys use frothing pitchers for key chains which is pretty hilarious. Cappuccino and cortado",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge in 365 days I actually came to Houndstooth after the Hot Lava Obstacle Course event. I was curious about being a coffee geek. The event was called Coffee Geekery and I had to go. All I know about coffee was Folgers was crap and I bought anything was not Folgers or the cheap coffee for that matter. Yes I was aware there different types of coffee from different countries. But I didn't realize there was more to coffee than expected such as the aftertaste, the feeling, the balance, etc. Coffee sampling or cuppery is maybe what wine tasting is about. I did come aware of the taste of different coffees. It was a great education on the different types of coffee. Espresso machine.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins So far I haven't been to a Houndstooth Coffe location that I didn't like. This location is always clean and well lit, with excellent service and, of course, great coffee! I'm particularly a fan of their cold brew.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins First things first, I've been here for coffee nearly everyday I've worked in Austin. I love the environment, the location and the workers here. Coffee variety is pretty interesting, they have many unique drinks a place like Starbucks would lack.  My one complaint is that with so many unique drinks they also fall kinda short on some typical coffee flavored like hazelnut. On top of that, some of the specialty drinks can be a little pricier...  But it is at the base of the frost bank tower, one of the nicest buildings in Austin and near a lot of financial corporate organizations. My point is, people are willing to spend a little more money.  Overall I'd recommend this place. It's pretty great just not perfect for me Very nice setting right outside of houndstooth to sit and enjoy a coffee with a friend",1
Coffee Shop 32,"To me, this Houndstooth location sums up Austin perfectly. Having lived in and around Dallas/Fort Worth for the past five years, I had just started taking it as a given that a bank tower's ground floor coffee shop is a Starbucks. It's so refreshing to finally see an amazing local coffee shop in a great location.  Having only been to this location once and on a Friday, I don't know if my experience was typical. Given my experience with their location on Lamar, I have a feeling that this one stays really busy all day. If you want your pick of Tacodeli breakfast taco, get here early. When I was here just after 8, they had already sold out of most of them.  I tried the Japanese Iced Coffee which was the first time I have seen this type of iced coffee on a menu here in Texas. Houndstooth knocked it out of the park. I'm not a huge iced/cold brew coffee fan, but when it's 90+ outside, this will definitely be added to my coffee rotation.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"Wandered in off the street and glad I did. Quaint little spot with smiling staff, great tunes and even better coffee. Will make sure to stop by again on my next visit to the area. Great personable staff who care to make great drinks with a smile.",1
Coffee Shop 32,"2 check-ins When I read that Houndstooth beat out Patika for best coffee in Austin, I HAD to check them out. The service was good, but the coffee fell short of expectations. Don't get me wrong, their espresso is still much better than Austin's chain coffee shops. But with Patika just down the street, the only real reason I would visit Houndstooth again is its ample seating.",1
Coffee Shop 32,Love the attention to detail they put into each cup here. I keep trying new things and they are always wonderful. I've had a number of meetings here and it's a great spot to meet with friends. Location is ideal and parking is always super easy.,1
Coffee Shop 23,Great place!! Love a shop that has motorcycle love and caffeine!!  Baristas are solid!! Cassie made us a americano and latte that stands with some of the best cafes out there in America. Worth the visit!!,1
Coffee Shop 23,A friend referred me to this little coffee shop. It's cute and the staff was nice. The cold brew was strong and aaahhmanzing!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Great for people watching. Had a delicious decaf drip, but it was a bit thicker tasting. Hard to judge a place based on their decaf though. The employees definitely knew their regulars and liked connecting, the space was just not my vibe with all the bike work and motorcycle vibes",1
Coffee Shop 23,Cute coffee shop that doubles as a bike shop. Ice coffee was legit. The barista was super friendly and gave me a free donut. Winning!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Damn good seasonal cold brew, chill atmosphere, and good service. That's all I could ever want!",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Nice new space and great to have more seating. Excited for them to get their own bigger space, and the tables in the back and bar seating in front are a great improvement from the smaller (yet more intimate) previous space. Think the shared space with Cycleast is a great match and looking forward to visiting again. Also, free coffee with any bag purchase!",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Stopped in here on a whim because I'm always down for a cup of coffee.  This store sells bikes and coffee.  It looks like they were currently going through some remodeling or construction so it was a bit loud inside with the work going on.  I decided to try the Mexican Mocha which is always one of my favorite coffees and they did a great job with it.  There is parking in front of the store.  Hopefully when the remodeling and construction is done there will be seats inside and somewhere to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and possibly check out the bikes.  Right now there is a lot of dust so it is more of a grab and go.  If you are feeling like a cup of coffee after some La BBQ, DeeDee, Bufalina, etc, I would definitely recommend you give these guys a shot or better yet let them sell you a shot or 2 of espresso. window sign coffee bar Street sign",1
Coffee Shop 23,Came on a Saturday afternoon. Slow & quiet which was exactly what I was looking for. Cool atmosphere and great coffee. Got the dogspeed blend which was excellent! Worth visiting!,1

Coffee Shop 23,Walk from the four seasons is short but a bit sketch- that being said - do it! Coffee was delish and the chocolate (gluten free/vegan) donut was out of this world! Wasn't expecting such a good little treat!  No frills little joint reminds me of Seattle.. Not to mention the mugs here are insanely cute. Getting a few for the road. Love love love!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"The most hipster coffee you will find in all of Austin.  No seriously. Everything from the space, the walls, the decor to the barista and the regular patrons. This place has hipster steaming out of its ears. Everyone was friendly although the resident dog in a basket was not so happy with my friend.  Be aware this is not a hang out coffee spot. You grab your coffee, and you're out of here. The coffee is incredible. But this is not a dwellers spot.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"2 check-ins So... this is pretty much as hipster as you get. Across cesar chavez (on the south side.. the south side) you walk in this tiny store attached to a book(?)shop or something and you initially question whether you're in the right place.  Yes you are.  They serve espresso based drinks only, so if you're expecting some 47 flavors of cappafrappa sugar crap with ten million options of coffee flavored sugar, don't come here. If you genuinely like the taste of a perfect espresso pour and a cappuccino with the little heart design with it's cuteness only to be exceeded by it's taste, don't miss out.  So for the time you stand their awkwardly feeling judged and not quite hipster enough to belong there... the drink will be worth it.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"12 check-ins This is my favorite coffee in Austin. Super strong, smooth and tasty. It's the first coffee I've ever been able to drink black. No bitter after taste and the aroma is delightful.  Don't be discouraged by the small space, go on in and make a friend. Brew&Brew down the street serves their coffee too so you can sit and chill.  Try the vegan donut too, it's delicious!  They recently completed their Kickstarter goal and will be building a roasting facility and serving out of a bigger space.  Their merchandise is also very stylish so grab a shirt and camp mug!! See all photos from B C. for Flat Track Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 23,Good coffee & friendly barista who gave us several suggestions for things to explore in Austin.  Free coffee w/bag of beans purchase if you check in on Yelp- one souvenir down!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Delicious coffee, on par with Cuvee in my opinion (they have my favorite beans in town!). Reasonably priced, $3 for an Americano. The coffee is such high quality, an 8oz cup was perfect. Simple menu makes it easy to order. I had no trouble finding the place, since I mapped it with the Yelp app on my way, and saw the ""Coffee"" sign above the door. I planned to take my coffee to go, so I had no issue with the small seating area.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Love this place! We are new to Austin and have been working on exploring the city and trying out locally owned businesses. The entry is cute and quaint and the inside is perfect.  It is right in the middle of an up and coming neighborhood. We were able to park on the street right by the entrance but there is also a large parking lot right by the entrance if street parking is full. There is a small coffee bar inside that 1 or 2 people can sit at. Other than that, it is just a small espresso machine, am extremely friendly coffee maker and an iPad to check people out on. I love how simple it is.  This is definitely a place for coffee enthusiasts who don't need a bunch of syrup and flavoring put in there coffee. We had we both a Mexican mocha which was amazing. The flavoring was just right but it did not overpower the flavor of the actually espresso. The gentlemen working was so nice and was kind enough to discuss places we should make sure to go to and how to handle SXSW.  All in all we had a great experience. Sometimes these small local places can feel awkward and uncomfortable to anyone who isn't a regular, but this was the exact opposite. Side note: the caramel they had as a treat that you could buy was amazing. We will definitely be back.",1
Coffee Shop 23,Amazing friendly service. Great coffee. Great ingredients.  I'm out of town and they fixed my bike and drank coffee at the same time.  Overall bad ass. Best coffee in town hands down!!! And I drink 10 cups a day. I know my coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Coffee is legit, tacos are small yet scrumptions and they have a lovely shop dog to greet you.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Wow I'm obsessed! First of all, the location next to a bike shop is so cool, so Austin. the interior is really well-done, makes for a great Instagram if you're into that sort of thing. The barista was super friendly and if you pay in cash there's a 25¢ discount! I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was one of the best I have EVER had. And it was a good size too! I don't know how she did it, but the milk was almost foamy, even though it was iced. Sounds weird but I promise it was amazing. The espresso flavor really came through and I could tell it was quality coffee. It wasn't crowded and I feel like it's more of an underrated coffeeshop, so this may be my new place for when I really need some peace and quiet to do some work.",1

Coffee Shop 23,A little coffee shop on the east side.  Coffee is yummy! I got the Mexican Mocha has a little spicy kick in a good way recommended by Courtney.  I got mine iced. Small coffee bar with good seating and a bike shop attached.  Everyone is super friendly!  I will def be back.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Let me start by saying this place is THE FREAKING MECCA OF HIPSTER COFFEE SHOPS! I mean that in the best way possible. Every morning you can see hipsters making their pilgrimage to Flat Track. Bearded men and tattooed women alike bicycle, scooter, and hike by the droves to flat track for their daily dosage of caffeine; you can set your watch by it.  Their popularity is no coincidence neither. Flat Track has incredible attention to detail. They roast their own beans and the proof is in the pudding - they serve some of the best coffee in town. I typically order a cappuccino - their espresso is done well and their latte art is always on point.  My only complaint is that this place can sometimes feel a little too ""scene-y"". Its a tiny little shop and everyone seems to know one another. My suggestion is where a jean or leather jacket and strike up conversation with the barista real quick, before they realize you're not part of the club ;) .  But in all seriousness, the coffee is great. The people there are nice. I only wish it was a little bit larger space and felt more inviting.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"This isn't the type of place you would go to do homework or read a book (although you can), but rather a place to go sit, drink a coffee, and make conversation with anyone that walks through the door or the baristas of this intimate coffee shop. Small and hard to find, but once you do find it, you will be happy you did. Great almond milk lattes, and mini GF, vegan donuts to dunk! Not to mention, very pet-friendly, and there is usually a cute dog hanging out somewhere in the midst.",1
Coffee Shop 23,The concept is very east side Austin. Fixie shop + coffee roaster...very cool. Well-organized. Clean. Smells great. Coffee is OK. I have had regular coffee each time. Maybe the espresso is better. Keep up the gold vibe.,1
Coffee Shop 23,Great coffee and VEGAN DONUTS! YEA! Bring on the vegan stuff and you'll have me there! I'll definitely be back for some more coffee. Almond milk and soy milk are always a bonus!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Adorable teeny place, perfectly cute inside for everything you need in a coffee joint.  Cute inside, perfect decor, a little motorcycle attitude, really cute outside mural with bar seating and stools.  Lovely, warm service even though I was a tourist.  I had slightly better (and bigger) lattes elsewhere, but this was such a solid place, I do recommend if you're a coffee addict like I am, in Austin, and want to get out of the grind.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Don't blink as you're driving down Cesar Chavez or you'll miss Flat Track. The small storefront can easily be missed but the drinks are fantastic and always fresh, including the drip. I tried the Americano and was surprised. Small package, lots of punch. Almost like the Barista that served me. Good service, good coffee, reasonable prices. More than enough said.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Great vibe and setup. Get some coffee, get your bike fixed, make friends, get inspired. Order the mexican mocha if you like it on the sweeter side.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Tiny, ""minimalist"" coffee shop... No where to sit, except a bar with four stools.  Like the decor, though. Coffee was tasty. Barista was friendly and very hipster.  Not a good place to do work, though. Better for grab and go.  The grinds are made in-house!",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Things that matter to people looking for a coffee shop: coffee quality, coffee choices, seating, vibe, wifi.  My take...  Overall: love the taste of their espresso, cool industrial design, friendly owner. Limited seating. 8/10  -coffee quality: fantastic espresso. Mild/medium roast with a VERY smooth finish. No much bitterness at all. Disclaimer: I ordered an espresso with a small amount of hot water.  -coffee choices: limited. No fancy Starbucks  menu or syrups. Just espresso, cappuccino, Americano. Can get them on ice. But this isn't really a negative thing. They focus on espresso and do it well.  -seating: VERY limited. 5 metal bar stools at a single counter. This is the one reason it's not a 5star for me. After talking to one of the owners, I understand they don't intend to be a large, ""stay while"" kind of shop. More geared towards grab-n-go or, according to the owner, the opportunity for one-on-one convos with the few customers who do stick around. One single, two-outlet plug.  -wifi: nope. See seating notes, above, for why. One-man show for making espresso drinks. The only seating: 5 bar stools. And killer look.",1
Coffee Shop 23,Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try! I got the cold brew. It had a good flavor and didn't need any cream or sweetener in my opinion. The place is really small and easy to miss. It was a little intimidating inside because it seemed like everyone was a regular or knew eachother and I was the awkward tourist.. Good coffee though.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Let me start by saying YUM!!!  Was just cruising around the city when I came upon this INTIMATE SHOP!!!!!!!!  WOW! None of those Starbucks syrups in here, but that would have ruined the wonderful experience I had inside!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The lovely barista made me an energizing espresso that kept me going throughout the day!!!! The espresso was from Rwanda.  I had a lovely conversation with the barista about what she wanted for Christmas :) Needless to say, FlatTrack coffee is on my ""nice list!""  HO HO HO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 23,I went there today in search for a latte to go . There lattes were very small and I was needing a bit more caffeine . The barista suggested Cenote which I thought was very helpful and kind . She wanted to make sure I got what I needed . I'll go back and try their lattes when I need less caffeine .,1
Coffee Shop 23,"First to Review Flattrack Coffee continues on the track (pun #1, done) of microroasting in gentrified parts of town within the confines of simplicity, rustic branding, and a little bit of technology mixed in via social media.  They currently crank out two beans for patrons to drink, and the storefront is as low maintenance as it gets. Tucked on a side street right off of Cesar Chavez and I-35, no sign draws you in. You gotta be ""in the know"", which makes me feel all the more hip; unfortunately, I do not ride my bike into the Eastside. The storefront has a couple of stools and a brewing station, and that's about it--it does not need more. It provides enough space to have a great conversation.  The two bags in stock, for your home-brewing purposes: Colombia Finca Miranda and Rwanda Dukunde Kawa. The former lends itself to a vibrant, clean taste, not unlike citrus. The latter affords the drinker a more full-bodied cup, with more distinguished fruit nuances.  At less than $20 a bag, these beans will definitely get you going for all of the fantastic pricing, good service, and heartfelt roasting that comes along with purchasing a bag.  Oh, and I felt super hip buying one of their $5 hankies/bar towels. I don't know if I actually have a use for it in my household, but why the heck not? It is branded with their logo. Homebrewing. Thanks, Flattrack!",1
Coffee Shop 23,AWESOME coffee. The space is small with limited seating but the barista was friendly (and had a slowerblack tattoo -- legit!).  Excellent cold brew. Cold brew growlers available for $26!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Fantastic cappuccino - one of the best I've had in a long time. Flavorful and just the right amount of cream, smooth smooth smooth. They offer their coffee at The Yellow Jacket Social Club on Sundays -  I highly recommend you stop by, say hi to Matt and try their brew before you head inside for brunch. Great service, great coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 23,Place is small but killer coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Usually when a friend visits, they want barbecue or a steak.  When my coffee fanatic friend visited he insisted that we take him to Flat Track.  That's gotta be some good coffee.    Nestled in the back of a book and misc. wares store, Flat Track's no frills appearance is a testament unto themselves.  All you can do is order coffee.  And the coffee is great!    I'm not a coffee expert, and I do cringe a bit at paying over 3 bucks for a wee cup of joe, but this coffee is amazing stuff.  It's light in body, flavor and really smooth.  It's also pure rocket fuel.  3 sips and I feel like I could punch through a wall.  So it's my new post-boozy brunch spot.    They also sell their really awesome coffee beans, but I may lack the skills, equipment, and patience to brew it like they do.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"One of the best places to get espresso in Austin. I just wish that there were comfy corners, but hey, can't have it all sometimes.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Great espresso.  It compares favorably to Cafe Medici and Houndstooth, which to my palate are the best in town.  Flat Track roasts its own beans at a location in south Austin and it shows.  I believe the person in charge of roasting used to be a general manager at Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco.  You can also buy beans from them; you can't beat fresh roasted without any shipping delay.  They favor a medium roast, which I strongly prefer because it tends to better balance and present a wide range of flavors in the roast.  Some people prefer the flavors of a dark roast in their espresso, but do yourself a favor and give medium roasted beans a try at least once.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"This is the most velvety-smooth-down-your-throat latte with that satisfying, full, bold and true espresso flavor that I've ever had here in the States.  One of my coffee barista/connoisseur friends brought me here and introduced me to what New Wave coffee SHOULD and CAN taste like.  No bitter/burnt after taste at all - good brew shouldn't need sugar.  Genuine and personable staff who invest in the art of coffee - good people!  It's a very small shop - a few bar chairs and the rest is standing room.  Not your typical coffee shop where you go and bring your laptop and books, but I think that's part of the charm since the focus is primarily on making you that good coffee.    Whole milk is used for the hot steamed milk and do expect a cute little latte heart art:)  If you are new, there is no menu when you walk in.  Generally, I leave about $5 and a tip for a cup - talk to the barista to make sure.  I love taking my friends here because it's unique and one-of-a-kind, and not to mention right next door to Las Cruzes and Farewell Books.  I'll be back over and over again.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Listed in Coffee Best coffee in town.  If you want to work or need internet access head on down the street to Brew & Brew. Come here for good espresso and good conversation in a tiny space.  I recommend visiting the other fine establishments in this complex as well: Las Cruxes, Farewell, Shhmlatz, and Dress Smart.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Wow.  Wow.    Best coffee In Austin.....actually, best coffee in Texas.  pared down little place with the friendliest and most gorgeous staff.  Velvety smooth.  if you want a latte or cappuccino....please come here.  I absolutely adore this tiny gem.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Great service, tiny little place to grab a drink. Had a cappuccino with some cute foam art",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Best Coffee in Town? Check Babes? Double Check Babe-alicious owner with awesome hair and a great dog? Triple Check    Flat Track has it all. Tucked away in a strange, curated bookstore, this exceptional caffeination station serves up hands-down the best latte you can get on any block in Austin (the block has a few coffees places on it, with another having just sprouted up down the street, all of which pale in comparison to the energizing elixir the brewin' betches at the fabulous Flat Track perfectly produce). To brew their beans, they employ a nuclear physicist/mad scientist named Amanda who rides a motorcycle and has a pet alligator.    The bookstore--who's name I don't even know, so I like to pretend it is nameless for edginess' sake--will provide all the intellectual stimulation your brain can possibly absorb while you sip away at the best $%@&ing coffee this side of the Mason-Dixon. For all you boys out there: if you want to take your tinder date to a great spot pre day-bone, look no further than this locally-owned Austin classic.    Some people say it is hard to find, so let me make it easy for you: On the easterly-facing wall of the no-name bookstore mentioned erstwhile, there is a huge mural of a boy who has frozen to death reading David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. Flat Track is conveniently located to the left of this boys ear and immediately under his sombrero/derby cap.  See you there!",1
Coffee Shop 23,Great place for coffee to-go. There isn't much space to hang out. We came here for a quick caffeine fix.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Went on my own coffee tour of ATX. I'm pretty sure I did not hit every spot I should have, but Flat Track was doing donuts around the competition.  Great great espresso! Amazing cozy tiny little spot to chill for 30 minutes, chat up the incredibly kind and funny locals while enjoying your coffee!  We tried Houndstooth, Cuvee, Brew & Brew...Flat Track was by far the best and didnt even bother exploring more after we found it. Just kept coming back every morning to perfect pulls of espresso and great times with the locals. It is a tiny spot...I dont imagine I would have had the same experience sitting there if there were more than 8 people, but I am 100% certain the espresso would be that damn good every time!  I will miss you Flat Track!",1
Coffee Shop 23,Enjoyed a great brunch at Yellow Jacket Social Club and stumbled upon Flat Track in outdoor patio. Matt served up a cappuccino that was delish. (It was competing with some mean mimosas and Flat Track still came out on top.) Plan to head to Flat Track before my visit is over.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"This review is for the Flat Track inside of No Comply on 12th street.  The coffee is SO GOOD. I love the spare, minimalist, pared down menu. I've had espressos, americanos, and lattes here and it really is the best coffee I've had in Austin. The coffee never tastes burnt or harsh like it does other places. The baristas are always super nice to me and I love talking to them almost as much as I love the coffee. The baked goods look good, but I haven't sampled any. I have sampled the caramels, which are super good. A small latte will run you about $4. Not cheap, but way better than the cheap stuff. Also I have to confess that I love the aesthetic of their cups.  Almost no seating inside. This is not a place to come whittle away hours on the innernet. It is a great place to stop by, grab a cup, and go. The location inside of No Comply is really interesting, too, and if you were to linger by the window seats for a while I'm sure you'd see some interesting things.",1
Coffee Shop 23,This is the best espresso in town. Thanks to them for ruining everything else in town for me. Always great people hanging out and working. I spend to much time there.,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Flat Track is merely okay coffee. The baristas are always kind, but the quality of espresso is incredibly variable. I've had good shots and I've had shots that taste of grass and cigarettes. I've had quite a few of their whole beans which apparently are roasted by Barrett's, not themselves, which was interesting to hear. I've had solid Rawandan but also a burnt Kenyan AA. Consistency of quality is a hallmark of good espresso and cafés and Flat Track unfortunately misses more often than it hits. Their signage and space are beautiful, though. Flat Track is quintessentially Austin, which means, to a degree, it's success is contingent more upon cool than quality.",0
Coffee Shop 23,"Matt's a maestro. The best, most flavorful cup you can get in Texas or anywhere within 1000 miles of it. Ride your bike in.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Exceptional coffees, and knowledgable staff what more could you ask for. In short it's down right delicious and a fun place to visit.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"Listed in Alternatives to the Major Heavy Hitters Flat Track is for the person that enjoys coffee.  This is not a place to study, people watch.  They specialize in making the best coffee in Austin and nail it.  If you have a friend that is a coffee snob take them here, they will love you forever.  If you want to impress your date about how hip you are, get a short Americano and visit the connected bookstore  I have used it many times to make me appear more cultured than I really am, but I usually get exposed after they discover my Gucci Mane mixtape on Spotify.  Best coffee period.  Houndstooth is also really good.  It's Kobe or Lebron.  Take your pick, you won't go wrong with either.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"I really enjoyed Flat Track's coffee. They take pride in how they make coffee and desire for the customer to enjoy the flavor of the particular coffee beans. Just straight coffee and cream (if wanted). No sugar. Sip and savor, not down and gone.",1
Coffee Shop 23,"I was very disappointed when my boyfriend and I stopped by Flat Track this weekend. We both work in specialty coffee so we were pretty pumped about visiting Flat Track after all of the positive things we heard from friends/read online.  Unfortunately, our experience was just ok. I ordered an espresso and a cappuccino. The espresso was good, but when I got the cappuccino I took a sip and nearly spit it out. It was REALLY hot. Hotter than a latte should be. I'm guessing around 170-180 degrees. Needless to say my tongue was burnt and I was bummed. My boyfriends capp was not as hot, but still hotter than a capp should be.  I would go back again... maybe the barista was having an off day, had a bad night, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. But for now, I'm not ""wowed"" by my experience.",0
Coffee Shop 23,This coffee shop has great staff!,1
Coffee Shop 23,"Probably the best espresso I've had in Austin (Houndstooth and Patika finish very close behind.)  There espresso is extremely dark, rich, and woody without tasting the slightest bit burnt or bitter.  Serious espresso fans will love this place; all others, probably not so much.  This is exclusively an espresso bar, and their espresso is not just the main attraction, but the only attraction.  The space is very nice, but tiny.  It's also (perhaps intentionally?) very difficult to find.  They have no signs.  The mural on the side of the building is what pointed me in the right direction.  The nondescript entrance definitely makes it feel that much more special, like you're in on a fantastic little secret to which the rest of this too-hip-to-function neighborhood is oblivious.",1
Coffee Shop 23,a true gem. friendly people. great coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 23,Simply the very best cappuccino in Austin. Their method is great. True espresso snobs will love this place!,1
Coffee Shop 23,I can't believe this place only has four reviews so far. It's a bit hard to find but definitely worth the hunt. The coffee is some of the best I've had in town.,1
Coffee Shop 44,"Loved this place! Super cute! Very quaint. Their grilled sandwiches were amazing! Can't wait to come try their breakfast! Would recommend to anyone :-)  Not a lot of seating. Probably seats about 20 people, but I love small business like this. Here's some bar seating that looks out a window. Took a few photos so you can see how cute it is!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Really great spot. It is easy, fast, and has some of the best breakfast food out there.  They have a yeast based waffle with a special waffle press imported from Italy. They can make stuffed waffles with it and just makes life good.  We also got the big ass breakfast wrap, which stayed together like a champ until the last bite and was fantastic. We also got the smashed chickpea sandwich. Out of control good. I think my boyfriend at it about 10 seconds because he couldn't put it down.  Also great lattes coffee and fresh OJ - go here Big Ass Burrito, Waffle and Smashed Chickpea Sandwich",1
Coffee Shop 44,Such a cute little place. The breakfast was absolutely delicious. Definitely can't wait to go back and try more stuff,1
Coffee Shop 44,"I went against the grain and had a Cubano. Came in ciabatta bread instead of Cuban bread (edit: as stated in the menu) and one lonely pickle. The sandwich was huge, filling and decent, but not fantastic. Service was attentive and friendly.  I looked very jealously at the huge salad that was being enjoyed by the patron at one of the 3 (edit: 4, not 3) tables and then looked equally longingly at the waffle her lunch companion was devouring. Those items rated the 3 stars, my sandwich rated 2.  If I am in this neck of the woods again, I would try the salad but never the Cubano again. Cubana and TC",0
Coffee Shop 44,"Was looking for a place to have a ""healthy"" breakfast after eating tons of junk during a girl's weekend tip to Austin.  I found Mary's on Yelp and we headed over there - it's near UT so we were a little worried it might be crazy crowded with students but we were there at 9am on a Sunday so it wasn't bad.  It was getting sort'of busy by the time we left at around 9:45 but we walked right up and ordered.  I went with a banana peanut butter smoothie and ordered the red velvet waffle.  My friend ordered their sweet toast which consisted of wheat toast with cream cheese, sliced strawberries and honey.  My smoothie was good but had too much peanut butter for my taste.  The warm red velvet waffle was delicious with a dollop of sweet cream cheese and drizzle of chocolate and raspberry.  YUM.  It took a good 10-15 mins or so to get our food but it wasn't a terribly long wait.  I can see how they back up during busy times because there were about 10 people waiting when we left and if it took 10+ mins for each of their orders that can create a back-up!  I used the bathroom before we left and found a cute unisex bathroom down the hall that was neat and tidy.  Good location in a small shopping strip with some parking right in front.  They had some yummy sandwiches and other breakfast options that I'm sure are pretty good. Cute and tidy bathroom down the hall. Red velvet waffle. That's sweet cream cheese with chocolate and raspberry drizzle. Yep. Yum.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Brunch time!  Although being walking distance from UT campus, I never knew this place existed until a friend brought us here.  Driving or walking by, you can't miss their sign out front and their interior decor is just as interesting.  It's a small place with booths at the window, several small tables, and a couch.  What a place appropriate for Austin!  Their menu covers waffles, coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, tacos, and salads.  Seriously, all breakfast places should have a sampler dish available!  Their waffles looked pretty good so I ordered an Original Leige Waffle with chocolate chips mixed in and topped with bananas and strawberries.  Their online menu has a list of different waffles, but you really just make your own.  First impression when it came out was that it looks kind of small.  Don't worry, it isn't.  I definitely had to work my way through to the end and the fruit tasted fresh.  The waffle was a bit dense for me, so I might consider having the bananas mixed in or topped with a sauce the next time I get it.  The sandwiches also looked pretty good too, and you also get $2 off a breakfast sandwich when you check in!  Missed out on their Gelato Pops too, so another excuse to come back.  There's only one or two cooks, so the food will take a while to come out.  Make sure you're not in a rush.  I was the last of a group of 8 to order, and my waffle took about 30 minutes.  Nevertheless, service was great and so was the food.  If you find yourself on their website, take the time to read their heartwarming story! Original leige waffle Mix-ins: chocolate chip Toppings: strawberries and bananas",1
Coffee Shop 44,"This place is SO delicious! I recommend eating the Sliced Avocado, Queso Fresco, and fried egg sandwich!! Add bacon! The Pumpkin waffles are great too! Get This Sandwich!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 44,STAY AWAY - Rudest employees and Coffee here is absolutely dick. Can't believe they consider themselves a coffee shop. I laugh at new companies that waste time opening just to close their doors in 6 months time due to poor management.  -  REST IN PEACE.,0
Coffee Shop 44,"Very chill, soothing, cute environment! The food looks and tastes AMAZING. The staff there are super courteous and inviting. Definitely plan on coming again! Cream cheese, sliced strawberries and honey on an whole wheat bread! Also offered on a bagel!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Light and tasty sliced avocado sandwich! It was nothing fancy, actually quite a simple dish I could easily make at home but that's exactly what I liked about it-very homey and fresh. It's a great place to eat a light lunch!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Nice little spot (and I do mean little). Great breakfast sandwiches. I eat here about once a month, so I would consider myself a semi-regular, but not a regular-regular.  What would make this place 5 stars?  Better staffing/scheduling. Often only 1 person working during lunch rush, sometimes 2 people = slooowww service... I've learned to call in my order 15 min before I come, but for those of you who don't: there could be a long wait (15-30 min for a breakfast sandwich). The nice thing is that everything is made to order, which makes it delish... but that wait can kill someone's lunch break really quick.  Also, this seems petty (and it is), but I don't like that they are categorized as ""Miscellaneous Food Stores-Conv. Stores, Markets, Specialty Stores, and Vending"" under their Square/card processing services. It messes with my bonus points. Where I might normally get 2% or 5% back for using my card at a restaurant/dining establishment, I only get 1% here because they've categorized themselves as a food store/market. Boo to that.  Anyway... love the breakfast sandwiches, wish I could make it here once a week!",1
Coffee Shop 44,Waffles are totally out of control and the big ass breakfast wrap is one of the best things I've eaten for breakfast. Go here Big ass breakfast wrap and as much of the waffle that was left.,1
Coffee Shop 44,"Really charming place with fantastic service.  Sandwiches and salads are really fresh and good portioned.  I came here on two separate occasions to grab some healthy salads, and both times, I came away really satisfied.  The coffee here is good as well.  As for breakfast, they have the Belgian Waffles and Peanut Bitter Pig.  All are delicious!  I give this place a 4.6/5.0.  I think you should give it a try!",1
Coffee Shop 44,The big ass breakfast wrap is quite possibly the best breakfast burrito/taco I have EVER had. The flavors of every ingredient mix so well together and their salsa is just perfect for it. It is very filling and I highly advise adding the chicken to it. The liege waffles are also amazing and taste so fresh and are just the right combination of sugar and flour to make them not too grainy or too dry. One of the only places I have seen with this many combinations of waffles you can make as well at any given time and the price for quality of food and freshness is a steal!,1
Coffee Shop 44,"I woke up with an intense craving for a bagel, and after having my request denied at Republic of Sandwich because they do not serve breakfast past 11am (I contend that bagels are an all-day kind of food, but I digress), I decided to check out Mary's Cafe. It was cozy and quiet inside and had delightful Halloween decorations - the space alone made me want to come back to sit with some coffee and reading sometime when I feel overwhelmed with the hustle and bustle of other campus food options. I ordered a cream cheese, honey, and strawberry breakfast sandwich (on a bagel, of course) to go. I thought $7 seemed a bit steep, but I was delighted to unwrap a hefty sandwich practically overflowing with cream cheese and delicious, ripe strawberries that certainly recharged me for the rest of the day. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other tasty-sounding sandwiches.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Really great place for breakfast, coffee, and gelato pops!  Small restaurant with cute decor and a ""Mary"" wall.  Not great for large groups. Lots of parking since it's a shared lot with Jimmy Johns and other businesses.    Vanilla Latte and chocolate liege waffle were both so delicious! Would definitely return!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Best food, vegan options, fun pop vibe.   Very ""Gilmore Girls"" :)  I went with the owner's recommendation (avocado toast) and it was amazing. You gotta check out the Mary Wall, too.  An amazing tribute to his mom. I think I'll bring mine next time!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Updated review Visited Mary's again last week and got the chicken salad sandwich. It was still a hit! Brought some guests from out of town and they loved everything they had as well (breakfast sandwich and the other one got a bowl, with turkey, avocado, cheese, lettuce and a fried egg).  This place is still a hit and I look forward to bringing more people here!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"This locally owned cafe is super cute and convenient for those living in the area and needing a quick breakfast or lunch break. The menu consists of a variety of healthy and hearty options, and the staff will accommodate to your needs well. I originally came in with a Tastebud purchase, but because of a miscommunication between the two businesses, my voucher didn't work like it was supposed to. Nevertheless, the friendly manager(?) gave me all the food I ordered for free. Such nice people, especially since I ordered a smoothie, coffee, AND breakfast taco! The bacon, egg, and avocado breakfast taco the staff made me was delicious, warm, and fresh. The Jane smoothie was a healthy way to wash it down, and the coffee was a great kick start to the day. Decent prices for breakfast and lunch fare also. I plan to come back for some gelato pops sometime! My breakfast spread",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Decided to check this place out based on some other Yelp reviews and the fact that it was really close to campus. It's a small little hole in the wall. The day I stopped by there were a handful of people at the little tables and a single, very nice woman running the show.  I ordered a salad to go (Old City?) and was really impressed by how fast she was able to put it together for me. When I got home I opened the to-go box to find a lovely salad of mixed greens with slices of apples, pecans, dried cranberries and some bits of cheese. The dressing was tasty and a good addition to the salad. I love a good salad, like ""love it so much I want to marry it"" love. This was a good salad. Not the best I've had, but worth coming back.  The treats they have on offer were really hard to pass up. Seriously, saying no to a sweet waffle was the worst thing I did that day. Gelato pops!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"3 check-ins Listed in Austin Eats on a College Budget, Just A Spoonful of Sugar I just really like breakfast. And finding breakfast close to the UT campus is kinda hard...you got Torchy's, Chick Fil A, Kerbey, but I wanted something MORE.  Enter Mary's Pop Shop. It's a small, cute cafe located on the way other side of campus (drive if you can), and they're neighbors with Cornucopia. They offer those standard cafe drinks, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, and gelato!!  I had the Avocado, Queso Fresco, Fried Egg breakfast sandwich, which is exactly what the name says. For those of you who don't know what queso fresco is (me), it's a creamy, soft cheese that looks like egg whites with a light cheese flavor. This is excellent for me because I'm not a fan of sharp cheeses. It's a pretty decent and dare I say healthy (?) breakfast (also comes with two orange slices!) for the price (around $5). But wait! If you Yelp check-in you can have this delicious breakfast sandwich for only like $3 something. Look at you being all thrifty.  Now what to do with the $2 you saved? BUY A GELATO POP ($3). Hello, this place is Mary's POP shop, and who turns down gelato for breakfast? Their flavors rotate and they usually have one vegan option (they had passion fruit last time). I tried their Oatmeal Cookie gelato pop and my oh my, that pop was DELICIOUS. It tasted exactly like the name and no it's not healthy even it says oatmeal!! But who cares! It tasted like a cookie in gelato form.  I will definitely be returning. If I can find someone to drive me again. :)",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Listed in But first, coffee. Mission find gelato pops in Austin: success!  Mary's is a super cute & hip cafe located about a 5 minute drive out from campus. Their menu consists of everything - from breakfast tacos, to waffles, to coffees, and don't forget the gelato pops.  What I've tried: - Salted Caramel Iced Coffee (2/5): I always order salted caramel at every coffee shop if they have the option, but this was mainly syrup, not so much coffee. I probably wouldn't order coffee here again. - Peanut Butter Pig (4/5): Yum! Banana stuffed waffle topped with peanut butter, sliced bacon (!!), and sliced bananas - Berry Mary (5/5): I was told that people order this the most and I can definitely see why! This is blueberry stuffed waffle topped with sweetened cream cheese and sliced strawberries  They make everything in-house and the waffles on the spot which is a-awesome! I'm definitely going back to try the gelato pops because what's a better dessert in this hot Texas weather?  There's a private lot out in front so you won't have to worry about parking and plenty of seating inside (plus wifi!)  Also, if you care enough to check out the story behind the name of the cafe on the website -- truly touching!  See you often, Mary! Berry Mary Belgian Waffle",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Easily one of my favorite breakfast places in Austin. They have an array of healthy and not-so-healthy options. Avo/Queso sandwich is super tasty, fresh and simple. Lately, I've been getting the 'make your own breakfast sandwich' option. Super good as well -- especially the ciabatta bread! One of my friends I dragged along not too long ago had a salad and she said it was also tasty. Highly recommend their waffles if you have a sweet tooth. They have a lot of options and usually have some featured waffle special. Last time I went it was a churro waffle!  As far as price, I think it's super reasonable. A lot of the time people don't realize that small businesses don't have all the luxuries of larger restaurant chains. So don't except super cheap prices but instead expect reasonable prices that reflect the quality of their food. You can easily have a meal here for $10 - $12 max. Probably, less if you don't get extra stuff.  Wait times are on the long side. Again, a product of being a small business. It can especially get lengthy if they have more than a few people being served. It's a tiny place, and they usually only have two people working. They don't have a true kitchen so this also adds to the wait time. However, I think the food is completely worth the wait!  I only have two/three gripes with this place....  For one, I noticed that my order is made differently (and I'm not talking about taste) depending on who makes it. Sometimes my bread is toasted and some times the eggs are actually cooked over easy. Sometimes I get chips, sometimes I don't. Not a big deal. Just being nit picky.  Two, one of the guys working here is a bit stand offish and comes across a rude at times. Not a big deal as I'm not coming in for a social experience, but a little kindness goes a long way. And I'm not social by any means, so it's not like I'm trying to carry a conversation.... think I read in one of the reviews that this problem has been fixed.  Third, the hours can be VERY inconsistent. This probably one of the only major flaws with the place (it's not even that major). About 50% of time I've been here, it has been closed despite the displayed hours. Again, I do understand that it is a small business, but there needs to be some more consistency. It seems to happen often around lunchtime (which is when I usually come). I know that they sell out of stuff sometimes and they don't have a lot of employees. I highly recommend you call ahead to see if they're open (during non traditional breakfast hours).  All in all, exceptional food, plenty of options, quaint atmosphere, and reasonable prices.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Listed in frozen! This is a pretty cute place, and sort of in a very random location near campus - I never would have noticed it if my friend hadn't told me about it. It is sort of a random restaurant with sort of a 1960s diner feel. There is an entire wall covered with pictures of ""Mary's"", which I found to be a cute twist on the restaurant's name. I heard the story of who Mary is from my friend, and it's super touching - ask the owner next time you're in!  I tried the gelato here, and it was pretty good - they handmake all of their gelato in the store. The chocolate chocolate chip is rich and delicious. The mint chocolate chip and cappucino flavors are a little bit lacking in flavor. The gelato has a really ""sticky"", pull-apart texture, almost like eating cake batter, which I find to be interesting!  I'll be sure to be back to try the gelato pops & waffles and the various breakfast sandwiches (there is one involving cream cheese and strawberries, and it is definitely on my radar).  I'll be sure to stop by again some day. (: chocolate chocolate chip",1
Coffee Shop 44,"We've had this catered several times at my workplace and it always arrives promptly and they set up everything for you.  The breakfast tacos are my favorite, actually they look like cute mini burritos. They offer several options including a few with avocado in them, which is my favorite! Also, the salsa is super yummy as well.  The waffles (not sure exactly what they are called) are mini waffles with some sort of syrup baked into it. They are heaven!  I've also had their sandwiches and ice cream and everything has always been fresh and tasty! Check them out for sure! Egg, avocado, and cheese breakfast taco with their salsa",1
Coffee Shop 44,Didn't LOVE Mary's...didn't HATE it. Just underwhelmed at the service and food options.,0
Coffee Shop 44,"Tasty breakfast sandwiches and salads.  You can make your own.  I had a mixed grains sandwich with egg whites, chicken breast, red bell peppers, and avocado.  Very affordable for high quality breakfast goodies.  Fresh squeezed OJ.  Didn't get a chance to delve into their waffles, but maybe next go around.  Parking was tough in the strip mall, but found the rock star spot right in front.  Friendly service. Small but cozy eating area. Good music.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Great vibe, the music is relaxing acoustics. Just sets your morning up right for a positive day.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"This was the first time going from seeing other reviews.  1. Very friendly service. 2. Small quaint cozy restaurant 3. Sandwich was very good but my bacon was under cook. 4. The seasonal churro waffle was really good but again the bacon was very under cook. 5. Prices are good but they charge for everything.  Overall, this was a great experience but there is still room for improvement.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"3 check-ins We came here after eating at an Italian place with no gelato on the dessert menu.  Seriously?  Yelp to the rescue.  I think there were 8 or 10 different flavors of gelato.  And granted, this wasn't just your plain old raspberry, vanilla, chocolate, whatever.  This had character.  The raspberry was mixed with homemade ladyfingers.  Yum!  And the vanilla was mixed with their homemade chocolate chips.  There was even popcorn with the yummy stuff from Cornucopia next door.  I can't remember all of them, but they were delicious.  I decided on the Fruit Loop (raspberry with ladyfingers). It was delicious.    My date had the vanilla chocolate chip gelato (can't remember the fancy name) & one of their homemade chocolate banana waffles.  OMG was it good.    This place is still pretty new (open a couple of months) & their selection is growing. I think I'd like to try one of their breakfast options next time.  I'll be back! Waffle Fruit Loop Mary Tyler Moore - she has the best birthday :) See all photos from Terri J. for Mary's Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 44,"smells really great with the Belgian waffles ( Gaufre de Liège ) and all-day breakfast cooking, but they were busy and I didn't want to wait.  I would try to go at a quiet time next time ( like when school's out for summer! ) The menu looks really good.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"8 check-ins Listen, fellow yelpers, there is not one ""bad"" thing about this spot - WAIT!  They are closed on Sundays through July... that breaks my food lovin heart - but they're beyond awesome, other than that. Ken, the owner has got to be one of the hardest working, food love giving, awesome music playing, gelato pop making folks out there!   The menu is simple, but oh so tasty and really does have endless possibilities with just basic, fresh and tasty options to mix, match and combine.   The waffles are fresh made and oh so damn good.  They're Liège waffles and, until you have Liège waffles, you haven't had the best.  You can fill them or top them or BOTH with everything from nutella to blueberries to chocolate to pecans... and so much more! There's lovely espresso drinks, even one with Ken's made from scratch gelato in it... DECADENT! Breakfast sandwiches can be created to your liking, or simply chose one of the great concoctions they have assembled. Breakfast tacos are a plenty, as well. Lunch?  Oh, Mary's has got that covered, honey... there are grilled wraps that are mouth watering delish, as well as lovely salads. Oh, and that gelato I told you about that Ken makes?  Yeah... that is the stuff my kids fight over.  The gelato pops are just too srumdiddlyumptious to even think about not having... and having every flavor over time.   All in all, Mary's is my go to spot for any meal of they day and I know it'll be fresh, made from scratch and made with so much foodie love that the foodie angels sing praises from the parted clouds above. Mmmm warm waffle with Nutella. Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on multi grain bread. Oh my goodness yumminess!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"3 check-ins Listed in ""Oh Mama, You So Sweet!"", ""I Have Ethos, Have Some Pathos..."", The ""I Scream for Ice Cream"" list... So when I was a fat kid, I learned to do three things really well:  1. Make people laugh. 2. Field strip, clean, and reassemble a Colt Government M-1911 .45 ACP. 3. Sit & shoot a pencil out of my stomach, with unerring accuracy, up to seven feet.  The point is I'm deadly serious now about desserts & sweets, because I'm acutely aware of what I consume these days and how often I consume it. And also, fat kids may be all smiley and laughing around you, but what they really want to do is blow your brains out. This may be TMI.  But it does segue nicely to Mary's Pop Shop. Unfortunately when I was there, the actual ""gelato pop"" portion of the menu wasn't quite ready yet, although it should be in place by the time you read this. But there were four types of gelato available, with three kinds of giant gelato/cookie concoctions, which all looked good but exceeded my calorie calculations. So I went with a tarragon chicken salad sandwich. And it was a really good tarragon chicken salad sandwich. Huge breast chunks, grapes & pecans? Subtle mayo spicing & celery? Yeah, that works for me.    It also appears to be a one-man operation, with him doing everything, and his website story is touching. The shop itself is cool. The coffee smells great. I'm curious now about the morning ""Breakfast toast"" specials, and how slammed he'll be during peak hours. But what impressed me the most was when he took my money, gave me change, but then washed his hands, put on gloves, and made my tarragon chicken salad sandwich. You know stuff we take for granted? Don't.  So right now, I'm a fan of Mary's Pop Shop, and I haven't even tasted the gelato yet. My instinct here is to let the newness diffuse a bit, let the tweaks settle in, and give this place a chance to catch its breath. And then pop in for a gelato update. I'm calculating the moments. New Belgian Waffle, and a signature gelato pop, strawberry shortcake style... Chicken salad sandwich. Unexpectedly great!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"2 check-ins Mary's is a sweet little gem in North Campus. It's a pretty small establishment but definitely very homey and cute. I came on a Thursday with two friends for brunch and all three of us ordered the sliced avocado quest fresco with egg breakfast sandwich. We redeemed the Yelp offer of $2 off breakfast sandwiches and one friend and I added bacon and the second friend added sausage for $1. We all enjoyed the sandwiches, they were very fresh (in fact we could see the guy making it from start to finish behind the register). We originally came thinking we'd get one of their famous gelato pops for dessert, but alas we were informed that the freezer had broken the day before and many of their pops had melted. There were two flavors available but they didn't entice us enough to buy so we left without. We'll come again to try a pop next time!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Nice little place, come here for lunch sometimes. They have a great menu and awesome panini's, I usually go with the chicken pesto. Only downside is they're often short-staffed with only 1 or 2 people working, but that said they hustle for sure when it gets crowded. Nonetheless great little hidden gem here!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"It's a cute shop near the UT campus.  I got the peanut butter, banana, and chia seed breakfast sandwich with an earl grey tea. It's a simple sandwich that was well done. I think what I enjoyed about this place was the simplicity and variety of items they had on their menu.  The service was good! I went on an off hour, so it wasn't busy. It was just a quaint breakfast spot that filled me with good food. What more could I want before the end of an Austin trip?",1
Coffee Shop 44,"We stumbled across this place by chance.My friends and I sought shelter during one of the flash floods and came this little quaint breakfast shop. All wet and damped the server welcomed us in and had disney music playing in the background to really set the happy vibes.  I tried a bacon, avocado,  egg taco and their basic leige waffle (apparently what they are known for). The taco was made fresh, you could taste the egg being recently cooked as it came off the pan. The waffle was amazing. I am not too much of a fan of waffles but it's chewy goodness sent me back to the days when I was a little child experiencing my mothers  warm and soothing hot chocolate when I came back from primary school. I have now found a little gem worthy of five stars and a place in my heart.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"I've been eating here from the beginning.  Now well into his second year he has upgraded everything from the menu to adding staff. Fantastic food, friendly service, and the place is cute.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"The food is amazing and the service fantastic! I loved knowing that the owner took such pride his place he was actually working/running it today at lunch as a one man show. Your hard work and dedication show Sir, as I thoroughly enjoyed not only my food but the experience from when I walked in the door!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"We heard about this place in a news segment that focused on local eateries.  The overall experience was fantastic!    I ordered the breakfast sandwich with sliced avocado, queso fresco, and a fried egg with a coffee.  My mom ordered the turkey bacon wrap with iced tea and my dad ordered the peanut butter pig waffles and coffee.  We figured we covered a little something of everything.  When the food came out we quickly took tasting turns and everything was so yummy!    It's amazing that bacon would taste so good with bananas and peanut butter cream cheese on the waffles.  The bacon turkey wrap was full of flavor and the tortilla wrap wasn't rubbery or heavy tasting.  The breakfast sandwich had a perfectly cook egg, not too soft and runny and not to hard and crumbly, but just right.  The avocado and queso gave it a buttery type taste especially on the lightly toasted multi grain bread.  The coffee was delicious, I didn't even have to dress it up because of the flavor.  The iced tea was excellent and had a minty taste.  The servings are perfectly sized to make sure you leave room for gelato by the cup or a pop.  The peanut butter and jelly pop was very delicious.  Who knew frozen peanut butter and jelly could be so good?!    This is definitely a ""do again"" place! Sliced avocado, queso fresco, fried egg breakfast sandwich.

Coffee Shop 44,"2 check-ins I love Mary's and am so glad it's doing well. I live next door and still don't walk over as much as I'd like. I've had various versions of their create-your-own breakfast sandwiches, and frequently order the delicious chicken salad on a wrap during the lunch hour. They also make pretty great coffee beverages--I tend to get a dirty chai. Ironically, I haven't actually had their ""pops,"" but intend to do so soon. The guys that work the counter are always so chill and nice, and the space to wait or eat is quaint, cute, and clean. The prices are slightly more expensive than other similar places I've ventured, but it's worth it to eat freshly prepared items made daily with quality ingredients you know are handled with love.",1

Coffee Shop 44,"Love love love the local charm and adorable owner!  Great place to stop for a breakfast sandwich, gourmet coffee or waffle.  The choose your own breakfast sandwich is my favorite.  Some of the toppings include a variety of cheeses, avocado, hummus, bananas and peanut butter (yum)..etc.  All the pastries including the bagels, muffins, croissants, and breads come from Texas French Bread and are made fresh daily.

Coffee Shop 44,Super cute and comfortable neighborhood shop. Friendly staff with a great menu. By far the best Waffles in town. Simply delicious and not to be missed!!!,1
Coffee Shop 44,"I had the waffle and a chocolate heath bar gelato pop. The waffle didn't need butter or syrup - it was that good. And while proper gelato shouldn't have any cream, it was explained to me how little there was relative to the milk. Good enough to pass my Italian heritage gates and be declared worthy of the name 'gelato'.  I highly recommend Mary's Pop Shop!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"2 check-ins I was looking for a place to have a quick healthy breakfast in the UT area and found a gem.  Everything is made fresh where patrons can look on.  I had the recommended breakfast sandwich with avocado, queso fresco and fried egg in whole grain toast.  It was a perfect combination if textures, flavors and temperature.  It was served with fresh orange wedges.    I plan on trying their waffles on Sunday!  It was Devine!  The atmosphere is quaint and I enjoyed hearing the story of how Mary's came about.  Definitely pulled on my heart strings. Great customer service early in the morning! Interesting decor",1
Coffee Shop 44,Yum! Called in a sandwich this morning & it was perfect! So delicious & perfectly seasoned. I'm not sure how the egg was cooked but all eggs should be cooked that way. Can't wait to come back!,1
Coffee Shop 44,"I don't remember the last time I walked into a dessert shop and didn't order anything. That goes against my values. ""Life is short, eat dessert first""? THAT'S ME IN A QUOTE. But it happened at Mary's Pop Shop. I have pretty low standards when it comes to dessert, and I'll eat virtually anything sweet. I mean no disrespect, Mary, but this just wasn't worth the calories.  I sampled the sweet potato pie and the avocado chocolate, both underwhelming in taste. They only had 6 flavors, 2 of which were vanilla and chocolate. I think the bigger problem lies in the texture, which was icy rather than creamy. My friend shared his vegan Oreo with me, and it was actually pretty good, but of course lacked the richness that I like in my gelato.  Another friend had a birthday cake gelato pop, which is their main selling point. Alternating layers of cake and gelato molded into a shape of a popsicle sounds genius. Ngl, it looked adorable. But it was maybe 4 bites for $4. It can't be that laborious to justify a dollar per bite.  Am I missing something here? I wish I had gone to Dolce Neve...",0
Coffee Shop 44,"Was looking for something close to St David's hospital. As I'm here visiting a family member. Came here for breakfast. Small, quiet, very nice atmosphere. Food was great!

Everything was as fresh as can be. Will definitely be back. Great job Mary's!",1

Coffee Shop 44,"2 check-ins If you throw a few of my favorite things into one cafe, you have Mary's. Breakfast sandwiches served all day, waffles, wraps, and gelato pops? Very much win. The menu is simple overall but has plenty of options that are guaranteed to please just about anyone. I opted for the tarragon chicken salad wrap which was very well balanced and light yet filling. It came with a side of chips and salsa all for $7.99 (plus tax)! My only negative is that I wish it had a bit of sauce for stronger flavor but nothing a little sri racha can't fix. They definitely use fresh ingredients and put a lot of love into their food! The cafe itself is pretty small but has a cute interior. I'll definitely be back for the waffles and breakfast sandwiches. See you soon, Mary! Honey mustard chicken wrap (top), tarragon chicken salad wrap (bottom). All wraps $7.99 plus tax! Light but filling.. so good!",1

Coffee Shop 44,"It doesn't get better than Mary's Pop Shop.  I have eaten here at least five times since they opened and gotten a variety of items.  Their waffles are hands down the best thing you'll ever eat. So delicious!  Today I got a breakfast sandwich and couldn't be happier.  It's so nice to have a freshly made, healthy breakfast option.  My husband has eaten breakfast tacos and other breakfast sandwiches, and I recently got a salad for the first time.  Everything is worth the money you pay for it, and more!  The salad was fresh and flavorful.  In addition to the food, the coffee is top notch and the customer service is perfection.  You can feel the dedication and love put into each meal or drink you purchase.  You're always greeted with a smile and fun music.  I'm thrilled to work so close to such a great place.

I have now had 2 meals here in the last 2 weeks, a breakfast taco with yummy avocado, and a tarragon chicken salad sandwich which was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS!

Coffee Shop 44,"One thing I love about Mary's: Their Tarragon Chicken Salad Wrap & make sure to add their high-quality queso to go with the chips & you've got your self an experience worth going back for. It's hands down been one of the best lunch items I've had in Austin when you need something quickly prepared but still healthy. I think I've had it about 10 times in just a couple months, & I'm not ashamed!  The inside of Mary's Café is so cute & chic. It's obvious the owner Kenny is significantly dedicated to up-keeping the place & its menu items at its finest. If you want to eat at a unique cafe or grab a delicious dessert with a variety of options made with local ingredients, all served by an owner who goes above & beyond to please the customer, you have to choose Mary's. It would be hard to leave disappointed. I can easily see it becoming a huge success story and a token addition to Austin's palette of memorable eateries. Can't wait to eat there again! :)",1

Coffee Shop 44,"Mary's is one of those hidden gems that everyone in Austin should be talking about.  It only opened a few months ago, but the staff has already tapped into something special and our taste buds and arteries are smiling for it.  What is it exactly?  Well, a little bit of everything.  This is one of those joints that seems to do everything right.  I have never had gelato this good anywhere before.  The chocolate is my favorite of the regular flavors.  The owner offers seasonal options as well which rotates on a fairly regular basis.  The pumpkin in the Fall was out of this world.  In addition, there are a great number of toppings that you can add to your gelato.  The coffee and espresso is as good as anywhere else in the city and compliment the gelato very nicely.  The wraps are tremendous.  The vegetables are extremely fresh, the eggs cooked to perfection and the use of correct sauces with each wrap make every option a correct one.  It really makes you wonder how Jimmy Johns next door could even stay in business.  Once everyone working in the area learns about Mary's, I bet ole' Jimmy moves to another side of town because right now Mary is kicking his ass.  Lastly are the pops themselves.  I had no idea what to expect since my experience has only been with store bought pops.  Comparing what Mary's sells to what you can pick up at HEB is like comparing fine dining to fast-food.  The pops are like a work of art with different layers of culinary pleasure to satisfy,  I've had the peanut butter and the strawberry.  I think they both made me moan in public like I was Meg Ryan.  The owner is a great guy who is very cordial and helpful when trying to make your selections.  He always puts on gloves when making your food and throws them away as soon as he's done.  How often do you get to see that?  Finally, the story behind Mary's is pretty amazing.  I won't ruin it for you here, so I enourage you to stop by, order a wrap, grab one of the pamphlets that tells the story, kick back, read and then top it off with a pop/gelato and cup of coffee.  Your taste buds will be happy that you did.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Poor guy was the only one there making food on a Sunday. He ended up doing absolutely wonderful, doing everything as fast as he could! It was great customer service! Not to mention the waffles and smoothies were super delicious! Oh and there gelato pops were quite scrumptious. We will definitely be coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Excellent food and coffee. I like that they use ghiradelli chocolate in the iced mocha. The gentleman behind the counter, though very busy from the time I stepped in, was very helpful and courteous, and had a smile on his face the entire time. It was a pleasure stopping in on my way to San Antonio, and it's right off the interstate!",1

We'll priced and they deliver!",1
Coffee Shop 44,6 check-ins They have catered for our office twice and every time has been delicious. Everyone has raved about the fresh salad and wraps. Its a perfect meal for lunch time and the cherry on top is the gelato.,1
Coffee Shop 44,"I need to caveat this with saying that I really want to give this place a second chance.  I feel like I may have just ordered incorrectly.  I went into the cafe planning to order the Chicken Salad Sandwich and ended up getting sucked into the Cubano.  Unfortunately, the Cubano turned out to be a poor choice.  The bread was toasted poorly and it was rock hard (as in that raw feeling on the top of your mouth after you eat hard).  The meat was good but the pickles were not bread & butter pickles.  A proper Cubano (at least how I always like/eat it) needs the bread & butter pickles to add the sweet component to the sandwich.  Instead, the sandwich included dill pickles that just did not work with the rest of the sandwich.  I also ordered the Nutella Strawberry Gelato pop...as awesome as it sounds, it basically tasted like a flat half-chocolate covered strawberry ice cream pop...not nearly as enticing for the price.  All in all, I can understand the hype as it is a typical Austin place set near UT and although I am not ruling out another chance, the first time was definitely a miss.",0
Coffee Shop 44,"Updated review 5 check-ins Fantastic...again! I finally found my way over on that side of town. Well, actually I drove 20 minutes out of my way to go to Mary's Pop Shop. I had a hankering for some true gelato. When I got there, I conveniently remembered that I had not had breakfast yet. So I decided to have the breakfast sandwich with fresh sliced avocado, tomato, crumbled feta cheese, fried egg on toast. I love how everything Ken, the owner and chef, makes is so fresh. Gosh, that sandwich was so good. Remembering that I had come in for some gelato, (of course after I ate the entire sandwich) I decided to get the gingersnap cookie with cappuccino gelato sandwich. I ate it as I drove away, happily,with the Rittenhouse salad, sitting next to me, that I was going to have for dinner. So, Yep, I pretty much ate breakfast lunch and dinner with Mary's pop shop. The cookie was amazing, The cappuccino gelato in the cookie sandwich was smooth and delicious. Eating while driving, was not the smartest thing I've done. But, dang, it was so good. When I got home I put the Rittenhouse salad in the refrigerator and went to a couple of appointments. Later that evening, I had my Rittenhouse salad. The homemade balsamic vinaigrette is fresh and perfect. The nice fresh mescaline greens with the candied nuts and cranberries mixed with the homemade balsamic vinaigrette was the perfect ending to my Sunday. I think I'm going to try to figure out a way to be on that side of town this week for a gelato pop. I can't get enough of this place. There's just something about fresh, homemade, inspiring food that beckons me to return. Sliced avocado queso fresco and a fried egg--amazing!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 44,Great fresh salad! I also had a delicious vanilla latte. I recommend giving this place a try. I will definitely come back to try one of the sandwiches.,1
Coffee Shop 44,"2 check-ins Delicious waffles,  breakfast sandwiches, tacos! Everything fresh! Totally recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Stopped in today to grab some breakfast. The place could definitely use some work asthetically, but it doesn't look dirty or anything.  I got a make your own breakfast sandwich. The flavors weren't terrible but I wouldn't really call that a scrambled egg. However, for the price I definitely would go elsewhere.  My gf got the sausage, red pepper, and egg sandwich on an everything bagel.  However, they were out of sausage (also out of waffle dough) (waffle dough?) due to the weather in the north east, so they replaced it with bacon. She thought the sandwich was ok but she hated the bacon. It wasn't cooked very well. It seems like they are cooking everything on a panini press from what I can tell. I assume that is why the bacon and scrambled egg wasn't cooked well.  Maybe we just need to go back and try the waffle and the gelato since it seems like that is more what they are going for.",0
Coffee Shop 44,"2 check-ins Watch out Lick; you have some new stiff competition in north Austin. Today I came in and enjoyed a tall, fresh-tasting red-eye coffee, and delicious avocado gelato and my beautiful girlfriend had the all natural strawberry gelato. Good friends, good fun, this spot makes my five star frequent spot in the #atx. The push pops have such a nostalgia tie to my childhood. AJ loves Mary's.... He also loves lamp So fun The menu is cute and easy to read. See all photos from Brandon H. for Mary's Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 44,"I've worked in the food service and fine dining industry for years. Saw a promotion for Mary's on an app called Tastebud, where I paid 6.50 for a good voucher of 10.00, thinking it would be a close cool new spot to try out (girlfriend and I live around the corner). They accepted my voucher and I bough an addition 5$ worth of food on top of the voucher and through in 2$ in the tip jar. 30 min had gone by with the shop not even that busy, maybe 10 people in the little shop. I went up to the front to address the clerk, a guy with short curly hair, to ask him very politely if the sandwich was almost finished, he gave me the biggest fake, bull smile, and said really slowly OK. Later when I went outside to continue to wait, I hear him talking aloud all the guests and his co-worker about how this a#% hole uses a coupon and has the nerve to ask what's taking so long. Last straw, didn't even eat the sandwich because he probably spit in my food. Don't eat this food unless you have an hour to spare. Not a pleasant experience.",0
Coffee Shop 44,2 check-ins Everything on the menu is amazing. The gelato frappé's are so delicious and my breakfast sandwich smell phenomenal and The gelato pops are so refreshing.,1
Coffee Shop 44,"The food was definitely tasty and fresh. A cute cafe spot on the outskirts of downtown. Sadly the freezer was just being replaced, so I was not able to try the acclaimed gelato pops, which was a shame seeing as I made this off-path excursion for this very reason. If a local or staying near the campus, definitely try it, but if from out of town aka: visiting from out of state, would probably give it a miss if staying in the city center without a car.",1
Coffee Shop 44,This place is fantastic. The quality of the food for the price is outstanding. Best waffles I've ever had. The owner is very friendly too. Definitely one of the best locally owned breakfast places in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 44,We went for the grand opening recently and had a great time! The staff was super friendly and everything we had tasted great! I can't wait to take my boys back for another fun treat!,1
Coffee Shop 44,"First to Review Had the vanilla gelato and tarragon chicken salad and both were excellent.  The owner has a background in catering and you can tell that this isn't your normal run of the mill joint, the food really matters to him. The vanilla gelato had a wonderful creamy flavor and the toppings just made it that much better!  Definitely recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 44,One of my favorite places for lunch and coffee - definitely try the red pepper hummus wrap followed by an amazing gelato pop.,1
Coffee Shop 44,"3 check-ins Delicious Belgian waffles, smoothies and waffles. The mix ins are awesome. U recommend chocolate chips and pecans with Nutella , strawberries and whipped cream on top :) Belgian Sugar Waffles with Reese's Pieces and Strawberries. So good.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"I ate here yesterday afternoon, and man was it delicious!!! I had the fried egg, queso fresco, avocado breakfast sandwich. It was filled with mouthwatering goodness. The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. Although I was already full from my sandwich, I tried a few bites of pecan waffle with nutella AND a chocolate covered salted caramel popsicle. Both were really good. Definitely going to start coming here more frequently!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"Breakfast tacos are fantastic, waffles are delicious and different and the coffee is great.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"The chicken bacon ranch wrap was wonderful, but next time I'll order dessert first!  The Sweet Belgian Waffles are phenomenal!  Great place, ideal location, and friendly service.  We'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"The salads are 5star down town steak house quality.  The price is super reasonable for the freshness and size!!  A great lunch stop...I can't wait to try their breakfast, too!! Yummy Fresh, delicious, friendly, truly local Austin, quality, clean, and worth every penny!!!",1
Coffee Shop 44,"I've only had desserts here, but I look forward to trying more. I would get one of their pop's or their chocolate covered waffles. If the rest of their items are as delicious as those, I wouldn't be afraid to try anything on the menu. The story behind this establishment is inspiring and I would take the time to read the framed document.",1
Coffee Shop 44,"The hours are wrong, the site says 7 but they always open late. Make sure to arrive at 8am if you don't want to waste your time.",0
Coffee Shop 44,"Glad to see a new place for great, carefully made local coffee here; and with gelato treats and very fresh salads, toasts and sandwiches to add to that! The owner is friendly and clearly cares about the food, the place is clean and cute. Excellent Austin addition with Philly roots!",1
Coffee Shop 44,Our kids love it! Sweet treats from sweet folks. Can't wait to try the salads next. Looks like they are made to order and even the dressing is from scratch.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Austin Essentials, Can They Kick It?, Austin Time Warp/Freak Show Anderson's Coffee is one of those little places, growing steadily more rare, that represents not only someone's livelihood but his passion as well. Step into this place, with its soft and creaky wood-plank floor, and be welcomed into Mr. Anderson's heart and spiritual home.  Anything you bring home from Anderson's will be permeated with the aroma of the fine coffee they've been roasting there for the last 20 years at least. Besides coffee and loose-leaf tea by the pound, Anderson's carries temptations in many other guises as well. So what if you've never used or needed a teapot in your life. How can you pass up the one shaped like a hunting octopus? Or the bars of best Belgian chocolate, the twelve flavors of marmalade, the cookies from another land, the fire-engine red French press?  I hit Anderson's right after payday and stock up on coffee for the month. The trip takes up more than my lunch hour, and many other more convenient places now have similarly excellent fresh-roasted coffee for a little cheaper.  But none of those places is Anderson's. Always for me the trip is worth the time.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Can't beat a 16oz cup of freshly brewed coffee for $1. This place, this place is fabulous.  I came here to get some coffee by the lb and absolutely fell in love. This is the cutest little coffee place. First, when you walk in you are greeted by the delicious smell of fresh coffee and the smiling faces of the employees. The employees were very helpful and knowledgable about the different coffees offered. They have lots of chocolate available, the cutest mugs and espresso cups, and lots of other things to look at/buy on your stop in. Not to mention they are born and raised in Austin!:)via love buying local.  If I could change one thing-the only thing, it would be that they had a cute little area to sit outside and enjoy the a cup of coffee. Still gets 5 stars though!  Stop into Andersons, you will be glad you did ;)",1
Coffee Shop 2,I've been living in Austin for 25 years and when I discovered Anderson's Coffee I've been hooked ever since. They offer the freshest roasted coffee in Central Texas. Any time my friends and family ask where I buy my coffee I recommend they go to Anderson's.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"This is as vintage Austin as it gets.  See folks, before the hipsters moved to town, times were simpler and people were courteous.  When you walked into a joint, you were greeted with a hearty smile and a friendly howdy.  This my friends, is Anderson's. Great prices, great service, great product.",1
Coffee Shop 2,The wife an I haven't had Starbucks since we discovered Anderson Coffee. Best coffee I've ever had.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Where has this place been my whole ATX life?! Oh, wait...it's been right here, where it's been since 1972 (I believe that's what they told me.) Yet another gem of central Austin tucked away in a corner just waiting to be discovered and henceforth treasured as one of the best parts of this city. I'm currently a little hopped up on their Flores roast - which is delicious - so I'm going to try not to ramble. Let me just bullet point this bad boy...  - Great location! A little out of the way so you're not on a busy street, but in a really cute little shopping center with its own parking lot so it's easy to park & walk around the other stores.  - The store itself is adorable. So many coffee cups, y'all. French presses, fancy coffee goodies, biscotti, you get the idea. They also have tea & accoutrements like tea pots, but I'm a coffee girl and I don't know much about all that.  - $1 cup of coffee. Let that sink in a second. They brew one regular and one decaf roast each day and sell it for a buck a cup. This alone makes it worth stopping by.  - Excellent selection of fresh roasted coffee. I'm told they roast on Mondays and Thursdays so no matter when you go in you're getting the freshy-fresh. So. Many. Choices. Their menu board is well-organized & labeled. If you know what you like you can easily find it including fair trade & organic. Also...  - Awesome staff! Everyone was so nice & very helpful as well as extremely knowledgable. They can help you choose the best coffee for a given application (like, ""I want to be kickstarted in the morning and I use a French press."") They can also grind your coffee the ideal way for your brewing method of choice.  I kind of already can't wait to go back! I was on a mission today & needed to get my loot and get back to work, but I will be back because this is now my coffee purveyor of choice!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This is where I buy my coffee in Austin. The staff are knowledgeable and fantastically friendly. They have a varied and seasonal selection of the worlds best coffee beans roasted to perfection. Fair-trade and organic easily labeled, if that's your thing. A massive selection of candy from all over the world and drip coffee sold by the cup -- you get a cup free if you buy a pound of coffee.  They're super competitively priced. I can't stress that enough. You cannot find better single origin whole beans in Austin for cheaper. However they do it, keep doing it. You've got a customer for life. In a town inundated with $2 shots of espresso. Anderson's is a blue-collar breath of fresh air.  Which leads me to my favorite part -- there's no espresso machine in sight. None. They don't have one.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Shop Till You Drop!, A Trip to Texas I love Anderson's! They have a great selection and when you walk in the whole store just smells wonderful, it is the smell of years of roasted coffee permeating the old wood. The worst thing about Anderson's is the small parking lot, but you can usually find something. Since moving away from Texas whenever I visit Austin I make sure to swing by and get a few pounds of coffee to take home, a little taste of home. They also have a wide selection of teas and various brewing paraphernalia (cups, travel mugs, brewing systems, etc.).",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I wish I could visit this place earlier so that I don't waste time on trying different mediocre beans in regular grocery stores. The staff there are very friendly and helpful, and they made a good recommendation depending on your preference. I like the beans that I got for my first visit.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I started working at a salon around the corner and one of my new clients worked at a coffee place called andersons! I looooooove coffee and on those slow days, a walk to get a cup of joe is exactly what I need. So I decided to go give their coffee a shot since I was almost out of my home stash and needed an afternoon pick me up. The shop is adorable with a large selection of coffee to buy by the pound and some available to buy a cup. I bought both and they were both awesome. Couple days later I came in for another cup and didn't have a dollar (yeah, for once, a cup of coffee at an appropriate price) so they let me have the coffee and I promised to pay next time. I love that kind of neighborhood customer service and trust. I'd give 6 stars if I could.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"As long as I've lived in Austin (since the early 80's), I've loved Anderson's. There's just no other place like it anywhere, hands down. First, the smell when you walk in the door is simply amazing. Is it because they've been in the same location since 1972? Then there are the people. Always pleasant, always knowledgeable. And the customers. It's always kind of quiet when I'm in line. Sort of a ""respect the coffee"" atmosphere. And where else can you go where they know how to grind beans for an AeroPress, no questions asked? In sum, Anderson's is on the top of my list when I'm asked ""what do you like about Austin?""",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Well hidden so I want to shout out what a wonderful little roaster and store this find is. They have everything that has to do with coffee, and right next to Russels Bistro or we would not have found them.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Excellent litlte roaster and blender.  I drank their Jakarta Blend for the duration of my month in Austin.  However, if you are looking for a place to get a cup of coffee and dig in for a while, this is really not it--Anderson's is much more a coffee purveyor than a coffee shop, though they do have two blends available by the cup each day.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"3 check-ins Upscale coffee roaster in an upscale neighborhood. The shop is small, but packed everything needed to enjoy a fragrant cup of coffee or tea. The employees are friendly and will take the time to answer your coffee questions. They usually have one drip coffee of the day for purchase and about 8-10 variety of beans to choose from. You can purchase the beans in 1/2lb. increments. They also have a variety of teas, biscuits and chocolates to choose from. I'm totally addicted to the salty  caramel chocolate balls.  Anderson's also has the best selection of manual and automatic coffee makers in the area, including French presses, drip funnels, and everything in between. My current coffee obsession is a light roast washed Ethiopian brewed using a Chemex and Anderson's has these filters!  Anderson's is a good roaster for you if you prefer darker roasts. Even their light roast is pretty dark to me.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This place is legit. The smells! Oooooh the smells! They have awesome coffee, a wide assortment, knowledgeable staff, and a charming store. I make a monthly pilgrimage to Anderson's to get my fix.  Also Cyrus, the mustachioed clerk, is one of the coolest and nicest dudes I've ever met.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Great variety and expert advise, the people here are just great, they are customer focused and very pleasant. Their variety in coffees from around the world was a great find in ATX, I moved here from Panama in 2007 and I was able to find coffee from back home several times but after trying some other darker roast I discovered my taste buds craved something more bold than the usual stuff I used to buy. They have great gifts for coffee and tea drinkers, amazing little sets and mugs and you can even sample their daily brews which they always have a few out. Parking is not the best, it's next to a few restaurants and it's mostly sidewalk/parallel parking but worth the wait and visit. Will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 2,The coffee is delicious and worth the trip.  I buy a few pounds at a time and use it in metal reusable Keurig cups.  I highly recommend it.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Ok--there are a lot of choices for coffee. Starbucks was my favorite when I lived in NYC.  When I moved to Austin, a wonderful friend suggested Anderson's. It is privately owned. They roast their beans on premise. The House Blend is always a grand choice--but my new favorite is Organic Flores. Truly an excellent cup of coffee.  BTW, if you want to pop in for a cup of coffee, you serve yourself--and it is $1.00. Yes one dollar!  They are also are wonderful in recommending different appliances for coffee brewing at home & are able to give you all the pros and cons.  They carry charming coffee mugs which make wonderful gifts--along with a pound of their exquisite coffee.  Best coffee I have ever had anywhere.  Why not give them a try--and support a really fine local Austin business",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I've been in Austin for one year, and this is the place for coffee. A cup of brewed coffee sells for $1, and their beans range from $11-13/lb. Not only are the prices competitive, these are by far the best beans I've tasted. The staff is always helpful. I cannot say enough good things about Anderson's.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"32 check-ins $1 for 16oz cup of daily brew.  Wide assortment of great coffee from all over the world at reasonable prices.  5 minute walk from work.  All adds up to a 5 star business imo.  PS If you walk in for a cup of daily brew and the crew is busy, just leave a bunch on the counter and you can be on your way.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Some of the best coffee you can buy locally IMO. It's locally owned and they have a great tea selection also. You can pick up a wide array of coffee makers, from chemex to french press to drip coffee makers. It's a very charming shop, with wafts of coffee aromas drifting out of the front doors. The interior is all wooden, and feels timeless and nostalgic, the kind of place that wouldn't be surprising to see in another 30 years, completely unchanged.  You won't be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 2,Best coffee beans in town!  I recommend the Dark Sumatra.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"We used to live in PDX, (Portland OR!) and now in ATX, very different places, actually. But a common thread, along with the obsessive love of clubs, pubs, and music is the coffee.  The best coffee available in PDX is Stumptown Coffee, also an old name for Portland.  When we were there Stumptown could only be found in a little hole-in-the-wall coffee mill on Division Street. People would line up out the door to get a bag of fresh roasted java.  Austin's equivalent, far as we are concerned, is Anderson Coffee on W. 38th.  Yep, Mozart's is darn good, but hasn't the variety and range of Anderson's fresh milled and roasted beans.  The quality is top-flight, with numerous varieties represented from most continents that grow coffee, particularly shade-grown Central and South American.  Price ranges between 11.99/lb and $14.99 for top premium.  The small shop, with its old, rough wood-grained floors, stained dark (coffee stains?) is not a place to hang out and dawdle over a mug, but to pick out confections of chocolate, imported candies and other treats, and nice little gifts for special occasions.  And to sample some great coffee and take a pound or two home! My only wish is that Anderson's, or somebody nearby, would open a hot chocolate bar to complement the fresh roasted aroma eminating from the roastery!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I remember shopping at Anderson's for fresh coffee from all over the world in the late 1970s when I first came to study at The University of Texas at Austin. Since returning to Austin in late summer, 2013 I have enjoyed Anderson's yet again. The quality and variety of the coffee is amazing (and inspiring!). This company is perhaps one of the earliest to take coffee truly seriously. Other treats in the shop are English and Scottish biscuits and similar treats, specialty candies, mugs, and a wide range of delicious teas. NOTE: if you don't live in Austin you can still have goods from Anderson's shipped - contact the store (I've done this for birthday and other presents in years past).",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This is a gem of a place.  The coffee beans are prime.  They aren't like the nasty stale Central Market coffee beans that just sit in those bulk dispensers for who knows how long.    When you walk into the store, it's like entering what I would imagine would be coffee heaven.  The aromas just wafting into your nostrils are so tantalizing.  Yes, I'm breaking out the big words for this review.  They have all sorts of coffee beans and tea leaves, plus an assortment of candy and chocolate.  Personally, I like the caramel sea salt chocolates they sell in small bags at the counter.    I usually order a pound of house blend, which you can't go wrong with, plus a pound of their special coffee bean of my choosing.  I like to ask the bean aficionados about the different coffee beans just to listen to them talk passionately about their beans and the different notes of flavor they have.  It's really impressive to me how much they know their coffees and are quite serious about them.  They are always so friendly and helpful, even when they are busy busy on Saturdays.  I usually go early Saturdays to miss the crowd and the crazy parking.  All in all, I can't say enough good things about this little hole-in-the-wall coffee place.  They also do sell a cup of coffee of whatever they're brewing that day for just a measly buck.  Mmm-mm-mmm!",1
Coffee Shop 2,9 check-ins Great little local coffee roaster. Come and order as little or as much as you'd like. Whole bean or ground to whatever specification you prefer. I come here every couple of weeks or so to check out their rotating 3-4 varieties. I've come across some amazing beans and the staff are generally friendly and helpful. The store is full of anything and everything coffee related as well as a bunch of over-priced treats. Check it out.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Great coffee shop for fair trade organic! The Kenyan is fantastic and you can buy a cup for $1! The staff is knowledgeable and polite and will help you achieve coffee nirvana!  The shop also has coffee makers, pots, and sell various teas.  Love it!  Parking can be a pain at various high traffic hours.  See their coffee in action at Russell's next door!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I can't speak about their coffee, because quite frankly, it didn't go very far. I won't bore you with over the top exaggeratedly pretentious opinions about the ""wafting smells"" that permeate this store.  I entered with a smile on my face and a courteous hello, only to be ignored by the worker.  Okay, I let it go and browsed the store looking for mugs/creamers and eyeballed their selection of teas.  Nothing stood out to me as exclusive, just the typical brands you'd find at any local grocery store.  The difference is, Anderson's coffee charges double for it to cover the cost of their rent.  Their tiny ceramic creamers were $5....uhhh...really?      On top of being disappointed in their selection, their disgruntled workers were an obvious sign of epic failure.  There were a total of three workers, NONE of them greeted us or acknowledged our presence.  Last time I checked I didn't own a cloak of invisible shield.  A simple smile and hello would have sufficed, but apparently that required effort.  Yeah....yeah.....I get it, you're the victim of low wages, exploitation and you have to put up with entitled snooty hags that frequent the store.  I'll never know how good your coffee is because now, I simply don't care to.  I'll drink my ""stale"" Central Market coffee any day than come to this place.",0
Coffee Shop 2,"Anderson's has been my coffee purveyor of choice for 28 years. They are masters in the art of bean selection, precise roasting, and grinding beans to your specifications (assuming you choose not to grind them yourself.) They also offer a superior selection of loose teas, fine chocolates, imported jams, and biscuits (cookies) to accompany your beverage of choice. They carry a variety of brewing systems and a wide array cups and mugs -- from the sophisticated to the whimsical. A visit to their retail store is a sensory indulgence. Their mail order service is fast via their website or phone. Many of the finest restaurants in Austin rely on Anderson's for coffee that is unsurpassed in quality. I do too.",1
Coffee Shop 2,Everything about this place is top notch- from the service to the coffee selection. One of our favorite weekend errands is stopping by to pick up our coffee for the week.,1

Coffee Shop 2,"2 check-ins I love this place. I love the people. I love their coffee and delectable treats.  It took me a while to find it, but will never leave now that I'm here. Honestly, I bring my own coffee everywhere I go now. Only 2 restaurants in Austin serve coffee good enough for my taste, so I bring my Anderson's roasts with me everywhere.  I personally stick to decafs, and have tried 3 different varieties. The French roast is a staple favorite. The Sumoan was really good as well. The House blend I didn't find as dark roasted as I like my coffee.  But honestly, other than personal preference, there isn't a single coffee not worth it's weight. The parking lot can get hectic at times, but I can always find a space on the street or in the lot eventually.  The people here are fantastic. Very laid back and helpful. Just try one of the two coffees they have brewed on the counter, or ask about one on the board. Specify how much, and what type of filter you use. And if you need it ground or not. Takes no more than 10 min, even when it's busy.   Oh and I hate sharing which treats are my favorite, but I promise you can't go wrong for a snack or gift for a chocolate and coffee lover. It's heaven, honestly it is.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Had to check this place out due to having the common name and all. I tried their local house blend Anderson coffee and bought some loose fancy Jasmine tea that was very fragrant. The store was full of cute coffee mugs, tea pots and gifts for both kinds of enthusiasts. It had an old mom and pop shop feel to it. They also serve up all kinds of drinks to go and feature a different coffee blend each day with free samples. Great alternative to starbucks. Definitely recommend checking this place out.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Take your time, be patient, enjoy the aroma of Austin's 43 year old coffee, tea, chocolate experience.

Coffee Shop 2,"Been shopping local here for years and realized I needed to say how good it is. Won't repeat the many other reviewers so adding a special note of what happened yesterday.  The owner, Jamie Anderson, took time to go over the different coffee makers, how to make a great cup of coffee, listened to my story and recommended  a perfect process for my lifestyle.  Best of all when I said I needed to go off and think about all this before I buy...he was cool and understood that.  Went back later that day and purchased. Having a cup now. Perfect.  Have to add - love those old hardwood floors.  Best db",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Gimme Caffeine!, Stocking Stuffers or Cheap Gifts I think I'm breaking up with Starbucks.  Years ago, I remember getting a cup of coffee at Anderson's but it did not impress me for some odd reason. I guess that was before I had grown up taste buds. Today, I stopped in to find Hubby a ""unique"" coffee scoop for his stocking since he is the brew master at our house.  After a thorough search for weeks, I found it here. On my way to pay for the only unique coffee scoop in the city of Austin, I sampled their coffee of the day.  It was a rich and mellow Mocha Java.  Wow.  Where is the bitterness?  Like I taste at Starbucks, God love 'em.  (And apparently She does since billions of people buy their coffee and goodies every day.)    Anderson's is a fantasyland for the coffee and tea lover.  My head spun around the neat and colorful shop taking in the mugs, cups, boxes of wonderful teas, fresh roasted coffees, packages and tins of cookies and candy, t-shirts, and coffee and tea accessories.  Simply put, it's a head shop for the caffeine addict.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"their coffee is awesome, their service is great and the atmosphere is very unique and comfortable ....... no chain store feel here",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This place is so amazing! It's not a coffee house, where you can lounge around for endless hours on your laptop sipping a frappuccino. It's a place where you go to buy coffee by the pound or the half pound. They sell coffee by the cup, for a quite reasonable price of a dollar a cup! Score! I got the Guatemalan roast, which is earthy and crisp. The store has all kinds of accessories for your coffee and tea drinking needs- things like wild French presses, tea pots, chocolates to serve with your tea, finger foods, you name it. The coffee selection is out of this world! They must have had 20 different blends of coffees from lands that I've only heard of. They break down their menu by geographic region, which is pretty cool! The prices are quite reasonable, considering the quality of the beans and the roast. The store is clean, and the staff is quite friendly and helpful! Parking was a breeze, as they have their own private lot, and there's a restaurant next door where they proudly serve Anderson's coffee, so if you wanna lounge around and sip your joe, you can do it next door. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 2,Updated review 4 check-ins Anderson coffee knows  coffee. They have been the brewing here in Jefferson Square since the 1970s.  As Austin's first and oldest gourmet coffee house they know a lot about coffee. When you open the door the natural wood floors only smelled like aged coffee. The staff knows about every coffee beans that Mr. Anderson roast.  They have tons of Gourmet coffee supplies. Anderson coffee are delightful,1
Coffee Shop 2,"74 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" I was in a warm and fuzzy meeting recently and the facilitator was going around the room prompting us for concerns. After several despondent financial and relationship stories it came to me, and my only issue and truthful response was I needed to get to Anderson's because I was low on coffee. Since I don't spend more than I make and actively work on my relationships, I just don't have a lot of angst to share.  Anderson's is one of those places that make Austin Austin. Staff seem to come and go, but their quality of beans, blends, and roasts have been consistent for me and their prices are remarkably modest.  I'm not a connoisseur, I can't discourse on the legacy of Peet, but I can brew some freshly ground Alfred's Blend that's just superb. I always keep their premium low-caffeine blend on hand.  Incidentally, I have nothing against caps and latts at Starbucks, I just get my personal unfettered coffee at Anderson's. In my office building's community kitchen, where there are always pots of normal coffee, I'll brew some Anderson blends occasionally just to see the quizzical RCA dog-like expressions from the unsuspecting Folgerites. The Anderson coffees go quickly, btw. I confess I amuse easily.",1
Coffee Shop 2,I am certainly no coffee aficionado but after stopping into Anderson's today I can certainly see the charm why someone could become one. The vibe of this place is fantastic and the staff is very helpful and willing to go out of their way to give you their opinions and their guidance one topics that not everybody knows everything about. If you want to order go to Starbucks if you want to experience a coffee come to Anderson's.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Coffee, the drug of choice That smell is coffee. In fact, that smell is some of the greatest coffee in Austin. I'm a fan of the Sumatran, but everything I've had has been delicious.  The service is fast, friendly, and attentive. The woman I work with discusses the coffee with me while I stare, dumbfounded, at the chalkboard of options and in the meantime served all the regular customers who run in and out with ""a pound of the MokaJava, whole (bean, unground)."" Other customers had clearly set aside to come over and get the coffee for special occasions, like dinner parties. There's also a lot of coffee and tea accessories, vanilla beans, cups, grinders, tea cookies and the like. While you're in, try the brewed samples and get a cup to go.

Coffee Shop 2,Cool store. Lots of neat candies and coffee makers and tea things. A cup is only a dollar! Coffee was good.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Yelp=Therapy Let me be upfront about something: I don't drink coffee.    But I have a very close relationship with two of the world's biggest coffee snobs.  These normally laid back, down-to-earth folks noses go straight into the air in regards to coffee.  They have been known to shriek things such as, ""No, no you can't do that!!!!  You will bruise the beans!!!""  Or ""Ooooh noooo, we don't DO flavored coffee,"" with a look of disdain.  They cringe at the thought of buying pre-ground beans and they lament the fact that their car's cup holders don't accommodate the carafe (yes carafe) of freshly brewed coffee that travels with them everywhere they go.  Pretentious much?  I'd say so.    Something else they are adamant about is buying their coffee from Anderson's.  As a kid, weekend activities such as softball games, birthday parties, and Girl Scout campouts were scheduled around trips to Anderson's (they are closed on Sundays so we had to make it on a Saturday, even if it was a very busy Saturday).  You would think growing up in this environment, some coffee knowledge would have seeped through to me, but nope, I don't even know how to brew a cup.  In fact, I'm quite intimidated by coffee and shy away from coffee shops.  I get nervous trying to order, afraid that I'll make some mistake.    One day I realized I needed to buy some coffee because I had house guests coming.  I went straight to Anderson's, and though I had some anxiety about ordering the wrong thing, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and best of all, not the least bit pretentious (ahem, mom & dad!).  Walking in the door, it smells absolutely divine and there are all sorts of little knick-knacks.    Quite simply, the best coffee in Austin.  I just hope I don't come across as high falutin now when I say, ""Oh, I only get my coffee from Anderson's.""",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Updated review I've moved out of the country... yes, out of the country. And I'm still having some of this coffee shipped to me. I'm doing it right now... just watch me!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"The owners are so friendly and efficient. I appreciate how quick they move when I place my order and how knowledgable they are about the coffee. It's also a great place to run in and pay $1 for an excellent cup of coffee. All you have to do is run inside, place your dollar on the counter, make your coffee, and hop back in the car! The only downside to that is when there isn't much parking but that isn't too often.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"When I lived in Austin, Anderson's was my go-to place for coffee and all manner of tasty tidbits.  The changes of the seasons brought out different goodies.  The somewhat rustic ambiance and the smell of coffee always delighted me.  But the best thing was the delightful freshly roasted coffees.    I moved from Austin (we all make mistakes) and coffee just wasn't the same any more.  A year ago, I returned for a visit.  Walking into Anderson's was a pure delight!  I suddenly realized that the reason I hadn't enjoyed coffee in years was because I hadn't had Anderson's coffee in years.  Now when I visit Austin, there are two experiences I seek out - dinner at La Fonda San Miguel, and shopping at Anderson's.  Together, they let me know that I'm REALLY back in Austin.  Since that visit, I've been ordering from them on-line.  This week, I ordered on Monday, and my order was delivered to me in Dallas on Tuesday - and that wasn't with overnight delivery!  Their coffee, their service and their very reasonable prices make Anderson's my favorite!",1

I received some ground coffee as a gift and decided to pay it forward by doing the same. I told them I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, but mentioned the type of coffee-maker each drinker had.  The perusal of mugs would be enough to bring me back. Oh, to have the time to come back and smell it all in.  I'm excited to give the gifts I bought today and I'm excited to come back for more.

Coffee Shop 2,"As part of my rehab, I have to admit ""I am an addict!""  To coffee that is...  As someone always in search of my next fix, how have I only just discovered this awesome place!?!  After getting brunch with a friend nearby the strong aroma of my addiction wafted by me kicking my physical dependence into high gear. The source came from a seemingly small house up the street with its doors open...ah you sneaky SOBs letting your coffee smells unto the street, drawing in the masses like moths to flames, zombies to brains, or emo teens to vampires...  The staff is really friendly and super knowledgable, they were able to take my obscure tastes and random descriptors into a blend I love!  And they grind your beans for you right there just the way you want them. The small entrance suddenly opens up into a large two room store with beans, sweets, and goodies everywhere. This local store has high quality beans from around the globe and several organic options. Like a head shop for potheads, this place is lined wall to wall with coffee paraphernalia, french press, espresso, and an array of gadgets I didn't even recognize.  Bottom Line: I drive across town to get my coffee here",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Best place for a cup of coffee I am so happy to have Anderson's in my life.  I don't know if it is the quality of beans or Anderson's roasting process, but the coffee I brew with these beans is the most full flavored coffee I've ever had.  They consistently produce a product worth buying.  I recommend branching out to try many of their beans, b/c they always deliver an excellent cup.  The other huge plus: their coffee is reasonably priced.  I like to try local roasters when I travel.  I've seen beans up to $16 per pound.  Around Austin, the going rate seems to be $12 a pound.  But at Anderson's, you'll find most beans for a couple of dollars cheaper, although they have started carrying a featured bean that is usually $12 per pound.  I make it a point NOT to buy the feature because one of the things I value so much about Anderson's is their lower price for a higher quality product.  The staff are also very helpful and friendly.  I was recently considering giving a gift of a ChemEx.  I got a thorough explanation of how it produces a better cup of coffee and all my questions were answered patiently.  I decided not to price compare, because I truly appreciated the service.    Thank you Anderson's for producing such a quality product for a reasonable price.  Please don't ever change.",1

Coffee Shop 2,"6 check-ins Anderson's is the best coffee I have tried in Austin or anywhere.  I started buying coffee from them several years ago and have been impressed by the consistency and quality of their product.  It is a place where you want to go when you are buying fresh beans.  Do not judge them by the brewed coffee they have in the store.  It is often too strong and not well brewed.  It doesn't do justice to the quality of their beans.    Over the years I have pointed coffee loving friends to this store and everyone who has tried it loves their coffee.  Once when we were out of coffee and didn't want to make the drive to Anderson's (about 15-20 minutes from my house) we picked up some of the higher quality coffee from HEB that was about the same price as what we bought at Anderson's.  We brought it home and brewed it up.  I couldn't believe how bad it was in comparison to what we were used to drinking.  We poured it out, threw it in the trash and made a trip.  Stop by, support a local Austin business and enjoy some great coffee.  Note that they will also ship to customers out of town.  Here is a bonus:  Try brewing your coffee in an Aeropress.  You can pick one up at Anderson's or on-line at Amazon.  It is the best way we have found to make their great coffee taste even better.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Just to walk in the door and breathe through your nose.  The shop is small, and the smell of freshly ground coffee permeates every corner. Ahhh.  Anderson Coffee has a great selection of coffee beans.  Their prices are reasonable.  The staff are friendly, helpful, and fast.  Oh, and they have  inexpensive coffee by the cup.  What's not to like?",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Oh, Anderson's, how I love thee!!  After a near fight with a line-cutting, blond bobble-head at the Starbuck's drive-in, I decided it was time to walk the walk and support my local store.  I admit it, I'm lazy and I love a drive-thru so I first searched for one by me.  Not a single one that's not a chain. So, I bit the bullet and got out of the car at Anderson's. OOOOHH, the AROMA!!  The daily $1.00 coffee was Italian Roast and it was HEAVENLY!!!!  Got an lb. ground and took it home.  Happy me the next morning!  Oh, and it lasts almost twice and long because it's so lovely, and strong that I use less!   And did I mention it wasTWO DOLLARS less a pound than SB!!!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This is an old school establishment than hasn't caught up with the times.  I haven't tasted a single coffee that I liked.  Their tea selections are limited as well as their coffee selections. Has anyone told them that companies are selling 4 dollar a cup coffee at the Dogtooth Coffee Cafe and their customers don't care if the price is outrageous.  The uptown, trendy market doesn't seem to appeal to this establishment. A BMW, Ferrari passby, that's for sure.  Buy online at Stumptowncoffee.com if you want to taste $60 a pound coffee or $20 a pound coffee.",0
Coffee Shop 2,"This place has a strange smell when you walk in.  It's 3 parts fresh-roasted coffee, 1 part lichen, and 1 part poop.  Your guess is as good as mine.  I really don't care, though, since this place has the best value in to-go coffee that I've seen in the city.  A 12 oz cup of Starbucks costs $1.50, I believe; Whole Foods and Central Market costs closer to $2.  At Anderson's, a to-go cup of coffee costs $1 even, and it's better than most of the coffee at the above-mentioned places.  Supposedly, their in-house roasted coffee is an even better value, but I have yet to buy it because my piece-of-crap coffeemaker couldn't really do it justice.  Someday...  The quaint but attractive shop is located near the original Kerbey Lane, which sometimes makes it challenging to find parking.  But I promise the effort is worth it.  Stop in, drop a Washington, and enjoy a cup of Joe.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Thank you YELP. I would have never darkened the door of this establishment had I not come across the reviews here. I've been by this store 1000's of times, I'm sure...but, there was nothing about the store front that ever made me know I'd love what was going on inside.  I LOVE coffee...I just do. Why didn't I know about this place?  I rated it a 4, but may come back to give it a 5 one day when I have more time and experience with it. I stopped in quickly this morning just to check it out and get that $1 cup of coffee that everyone here was raving about. Too cool....really good coffee, in decent take away cups (I ABHOR good coffee in white stryofoam) - and how cute was the little dish of sugar cubes with the golden ""pick-them-up-thingie""?!  I checked out all the cups (LOVE coffee cups...they have to be the right size, weight, shape...yep, I'm anal) and they had quite a selection! So many neat things to see...and fun to browse. It smelled wonderful - and I carefully noted the staff (considering the varying reviews).  I'll have to go back and buy some beans. I'll write another review at that time. I'm looking forward to it!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I have been buying coffee here for years and it does not get any fresher or better., and their prices are very competitive. Occasionally I buy elsewhere because I haven't been able to get over to Anderson's and am I always reminded (by my spouse) that the coffee isn't as good. I have to concur, however, with a relatively recent review that criticized one of the staff. I, myself, had a very surly encounter last week with someone with whom I don't usually interact.. She was the exception, not the rule, thankfully. But a customer service business like this should have zero tolerance for any staff with a scowl on their face.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Anderson's Coffee has been the absolute best thing we have found since we moved to Austin!!!  Our morning coffee is so important, and they fixed us up with a custom blend of sumatra beans that we cannot live without now!

If you have issues with coffee, stop in and let them advise you, and recommend a blend that will start your day off perfectly!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 2,A great replacement for my Peet's coffee! Friends recommended this bean joint before I even moved here. The employees will help guide you in bean selection if you ask.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Wow, what a find!  For a person who goes all over town to coffee shops and has been living in Hyde Park and Cherrywood for the past 3 years, finding this EXCELLENT coffee roaster in my backyard is like a dream.  No, not literally in my backyard.  Anderson's Coffee Company has apparently been around for quite awhile.    We found it right on Kerbey Lane off of old 38th street in a fancy strip mall.  The place smelled great upon walking in.  You walk straight to the back of the store where a huge chalkboard details the many varieties of coffee available for purchase.  Being relatively clueless when it comes to coffee types, I tried to describe what I was looking for to the red-aproned attendant.  He suggested their Sulowesi Kolossi, which sounded interesting and ended up being wonderful.  Considering that their prices are ~$10 a pound, there is no excuse for buying your coffee from the grocery store any longer.  Anderson's makes some of the best coffee I've ever had and is easy to get in and out of quickly.  Give it a shot!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Listed in Born to Shop, It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion This was a very lovely little shop, one I will have to return to when i have more time to shop.  A great selection of teas and coffees, and of... chocolates and biscuits! Everyone was friendly and the whole place had that wonderful coffee aroma!  I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"My very first coffee came from Anderson's in 1978 and I've never looked back! They were ""doing"" coffee before coffee was cool...or, should it be, before coffee was hot?  Jamie Anderson learned his roasting skills from the paterfamilias of the American coffee  movement, that is, Alfred Peet, way back in the early '70s. For those who don't know, Mr. Peet taught lots of people the roasting art, and a few of his disciples migrated to Seattle after some time in Berkeley, to sell Peet's coffee in that town under the name Starbucks.  Anderson's doesn't dive too deeply into the wacky world of single origin/estate beans, sticking to a proven variety of classic classics, and they just do those better than just about anyone...with 40 years experience in this deep, rich cup, they were doing it before most of today's coffee hot rods were even born. The best part is, well, the second best part after the quality, is the price...shop around. I live in Portland where the ultra hip Stumptown runs 12-20 per pound...and up. And it's never, ever as good as Anderson's where the top coffees go for maybe 8.95 or 9.95 max. I think you can still get some varieties for 7.95! Stumptown, y'all need to go back to school, take a big slice of humble pie, and start over!  Austin, if you like great coffee, get to Anderson's. It's just that simple. Regardless of what you hear or read, NO ONE in town does this better.",1
Coffee Shop 2,As Austin becomes more and more of a destination for coffee aficionados more and more locations for getting great coffee are sprouting up around campus and downtown areas. While Anderson's product quality is still top tier I'd expect them to step up their customer service to keep shopping there a pleasant experience. Two stars reflects the recent downward trend in service I've experienced. It all came to a head when I got a flat out no to a simple request from one of the bean clerks. A tallish short dark haired slender fellow who barely acknowledged me as a customer waiting for service. FWIW apparently their coffee bags are too precious to waste on a 1/4 pound of ground coffee. Maybe I'll bring my own paper bag next time to avoid being treated like an ass hole for a small request. However I don't think I should have to.,0
Coffee Shop 2,wanted a very good cup of coffee on a Saturday afternoon and Anderson's was a place that I had confidence in... have been getting lousy coffee at trendy high ranked yelpy spots as of late and wanted better... Anderson's is better! Appreciate their long history serving Austin's coffee community.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"How am I just finding out about Anderson's?? It's like a dream in there (except you could never actually dream in there because you'd be so buzzed on coffee). And everyone is extremely helpful and friendly. Also, the service is crazy fast.  If you like coffee, you should definitely check this place out. Heads up though, parking can be kinda crazy on a Saturday morning due to all the cafes around there.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I am a native Austinite, and my mother and I have been devotees of Anderson's Coffee for more than two decades. We both love the Sulawesi and Sumatra coffees, but every holiday season we buy the Holiday Blend because it is just that good.  This is not a ""cafe""--it's just a simple store to buy coffee and tea and accessories. If you want to sit and drink Anderson's Coffee, Russell's is right next door and uses Anderson's in their coffee beverages.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"In this ever changing world it's incredibly comforting to have the constancy of Anderson's coffee.  They've never bothered to expand - having a shop on every corner has fortunately never been their mantra..  When one enters the store, one if overwhelmed by the wonderful aroma emanating from those roasted beans.  My favorite coffee is their Dark Sumatra - it's very bold but never bitter - I start almost every morning of my waking life with at least two cups.  On occasion, when they've been out of the Dark Sumatra, the staff has provided me alternatives which have also been quite pleasing.  Everyone that works there is very knowledgeable and most accommodating.   And when I've been unable to pick up coffee during regular hours, they've arranged for me to pick it up at Russell' s Bakery next store.   How many business do you know that will do that?  Trendy coffee shops with their overpriced prissy drinks and mediocre beans will come and go, but thankfully Anderson's is here for the long haul.",1
Coffee Shop 2,Great coffee in bulk. And it's like only a BUCK for a cup of it! Great tasty tidbits. Great atmosphere. YUMMMM. Such an austin icon.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"I do not like to think of myself as a SNOB.  Or maybe I do?  I have been asking myself that lately?  All I know is that I am very careful about trying things I love.  Because once I tasted the ""Premo"", I have a REAL hard time settling for anything less.  For example, a few years ago I went in to Andersons, bought an AEROPRESS (Awesome!) and a pound of beans.    Went home and experimented with my new coffee pump and I had cup after cup of the best coffee of my life.  I called my wife, tweaking out on caffeine, ""OH MY GOODNESS THIS COFFEE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!   AHHHWWW I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS COFFEE IS  BAWWWAAAHHH!!!""  Now 3 years have passed by and I have this to say.  The Aeropress is mind blowing.  I always order an Americano when I am buying a cup of coffee from a local establishment, and I have had maybe three cups that are in the same dimension as what I can get out of that AEROPRESS.  Absolutely amazing!    While I used to think that it was the AEROPRESS that made any coffee amazing, I have learned that the AEROPRESS can only bring coffee to its full potential.  I have tried coffee beans from many places and NO BODY has coffee like Andersons.  It is so good that I will be at the grocery store, standing in front of the Coffee, completely out at home and my eyes will be swelling up with tears  looking at the sorry ass beans.  Looking and looking at all of the sorry bags of coffee. I used to really like some of the more expensive bags, but they all fall way short of Andersons.    So I tell myself ""SELF, if you buy coffee here, you wont make a point to stop by andersons, and every time you make a cup with theses crappy beans you will disappointed.  Go with out, and get to Andersons ASAP.""  So that is what I do.  I love Andersons coffee so much that I will go without coffee for several days until I can get the good stuff.  I love coffee, but now that I can have the best, that is what I want.  The best or bust.  If there is better coffee out there, I will try it.  Trust me I am looking!  But as of the last three years Andersons is the winner.  Java Panture and Italian Expresso is what i get the most often, but it is all good.  Also, the decaf is so good!  I used to think of decaf coffee as dirty brown water, or a pointless waste of time, but this Decaf is a delicious treat.  Okay so I am a snob about what I am passionate about.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Anderson's has turned me into a coffee snob.  I cannot drink 'regular' coffee anymore.  My favorite blend is the Guatamala Antigua. I stop by to pick up 2 pounds of my favorite once a month.   Not only do they have great coffees, but a wonderful tea selection as well.  Oh and dont forget to try some of the artisan chocolates.. the sea salt carmels are addictive!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I grew up in Austin (anyone else? Other than my old high school Latin teacher? I'm starting to feel like we're an endangered species) but only dropped into this place for the first time about three years ago.  Live in Oregon now, which has its fair share of coffee houses, but every time I go back to visit the parents, I literally will buy a dozen bags of the House Blend. This is the only coffee I drink. If only for the cornucopia of Roasted Bean Smells when I open up my suitcase... sigh, heaven...  The other 5-star reviews don't lie, people!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"A sign that their coffee might just be good is when your mother asks you if you've brought any more of 'that coffee from that place' every time you visit. And she's talking about the 60/40 caffeine blend because her doctor told her to cut back, and as a rule, she absolutely hates decaf. But she likes Jamie Anderson's blend.  Me? I'm rather partial to the Red Sea Blend and Alfred's Blend.  The price is right, too, if you're used to buying bulk beans and not Folger's or Sanka. His coffee runs $9-$11 a pound. That's by and by cheaper than most of Central Market's stuff just down the road.  I've never had the customer service problems that have been described by others on this board. I can believe that they occasionally exist as it's a small business and not all small businesses subscribe to a doormat customer service policy.  But I usually have Mr. Anderson in his apron and bowtie serving me. Or some cute young guy serving up my beans. It's not unusual, even on a busy Saturday morning, for me to be asked three or four times if I've been helped while I'm in the middle of getting my order filled already. That's good customer service to me.  My only complaint is that I wish they'd carry more fair trade beans.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This is the best smell in Austin, Texas. Take your florists, salons, or restaurants... it's even better than tanning skin at Barton Creek... fine olfactory experiences all... take every one of them, and well you'd have a major stink if you put them all together. SINGULARLY, though, Anderson Coffee is The Incredible Austin Smell. Give me a candle, a spray, something. I want to be wrapped in the scent. (And now that the nose part of myself has expressed itself, perhaps inappropriately...)  Here goes: - Really top-notch, so-fresh-it-bubbles, roasted coffee. - I am addicted to the Fancy Jasmine green tea they carry. - Their collection of chocolates is hard to beat. - Head on over if you're looking for cool tea pots and coffee accessories.  One of the reviewers mentioned they're not the nicest staff. Customer service is a big deal, but I've never had them be rude to me. Are they sunshiney-give-me-a-big-hug? No. But I don't get the ""hipper-than-thou"" attitude too many of this town's establishments dish out. (That's right, Thundercloud. I'm looking at you.) These people know their stuff. They what they do well. I can't fault them.  I've been going to Anderson's for years. They've never let me down. They were doing the roasted beans thing way before the mermaid moved in. It is the sort of business that makes this city great.  If you like coffee, you owe it to yourself to pick up some of theirs and take it home with you. You won't be sorry.",1
Coffee Shop 2,I've been going to Anderson's since I was a toddler with my mom.  It is one of my absolute favorite places in Austin. The rich coffee smell is AWESOME.  I don't buy my coffee anywhere else. The Dark Sumatra is the best.  I recently discovered you can call in your order and then pick it up - saves me 10 minutes.  I've never found a reason to complain about the staff - they've always been incredibly nice people.  I really cannot say enough good things about Anderson's Coffee.,1

The staff are knowledgable and passionate about their excellent product, as well as attentive and good humored; we joked & laughed the entire time we were in there. Add to that the wide collection of brewing accessories, jams, jellies, biscuits, and candies... and Anderson's is now on my monthly shopping calendar. We walked out of there with some candies I haven't seen since my childhood, a pound of organic Sumatran coffee (which is excellent, by the way) and some English shortbread biscuits my parents used to serve for high tea. I love Anderson's, and I LOVE AUSTIN!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Great place that has been an Austin tradition for years.  The place that taught me that all coffee was not Folgers.  Yes, one or two of the staff have been crabby a time or two, but they have been generally knowledgeable and friendly over the 20-odd years I've been going there.  Actually, sorry, I must comment further on this issue.  Folks, this is what you get sometimes when you deal with small businesses staffed by real people who are not trained into absolute subservience.  If you don't like the way you are treated and it bothers you sooooo much, then tell the management.  Mr. Anderson has been there almost every time I've been, he's your guy.  Or, just ignore it.  The Kenya AA is my favorite, Arabian Mocha is also darn tasty.  I've mucked around with a few of their loose leaf teas, no complaints.

They have a great little store with all of the coffee accessories you can imagine and some very nice chocolates and sweets.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I really love Anderson's! Their coffee is fantastic & I love shopping there. The past 2 years i was out of Austin and tried out a wide range of good coffees-Portland's Stumptown, Chicago's Intelligentsia, and NC's Counterculture. All are good well-regarded brews. In fact, i truly wondered, after some time without it,  how Anderson's would measure up. Fortunately, the answer is that Anderson's continues to meet and exceed my expectations, with great taste and quality. yum!  Anderson's coffee has several roasts rated highly as a ""cup of excellence"". Moreover, compared to the other coffees out there, Anderson's is  far more economical. Counterculture, Stumptown and Intelligentsia all sell 12oz bags of beans for over $12 whereas at Anderson's, a full 16oz is still less than $10. For a couple who goes through a large amount of coffee each month, this is important, and appreciated.  Anderson's sells many Fair Trade and Organic coffees.  A few years ago, Anderson's started offering coffee by the cup. When i was there today, i was happy to see they still offer it. A real treat, the coffee costs just $1 and is delicious, putting Pike's place to shame!  My favorite is the Red Sea Blend, but i really love trying all the different types. Recently, i've been enjoying the Nicaraguan. The staff at Anderson's is friendly, the store is inviting and intriguing. You can buy coffee filters, cool mugs, tshirts, grinders, specialty candies, and all types of coffee makers and paraphernalia.  oh yeah, Anderson's stocks a nice variety of teas and tea paraphernalia  mmm, coffee!  ps: the Holiday Blend is da bomb!  pps: i've now tried the decaf, and the 40/60 blend. Also good, and i can't tell it's decaf",1
Coffee Shop 2,"We've been drinking the coffee purchased here for over year and I've been impressed with their variety, freshness and taste. I like the java blend and the vieneese blend.

Coffee Shop 2,"I've been a coffee drinker since I was 15. Before that I would occasionally have a small cup from the pot my mom brewed with Anderson's coffee beans (loaded with sugar of course). I can't remember drinking any other coffee in my life. I'm 22 years old now and have always started my day with Anderson's coffee. I've been to coffee shops all around town and there is no substitute. My favorite's the colombian, so I always get a pound of that plus another pound of a random roast I feel like trying. I'm about to move to Oregon and will probably start having them mail me my coffee. It's that good.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"I love the coffee here and I love the staff.  I never drank coffee until about six years ago, and I got started or ""hooked"" on it by Starbucks caramel frappucino.  Well, I've moved on since then and now that I work right by this place, this is where I go to get my caffeine.    It's $1 for a cup of good tasting coffee.  The first time that I went in there, it was explained to me that the drinks that they sell there are coffee and decaf.  That's it.  There's one size.  If you want a creamer, they have half and half.  Do you prefer soy milk in your coffee?  Bring your own or go somewhere else.  I've come a long way since Starbucks.  I can't believe that I really drank that stuff.  Thank you Anderson's.  Thank you so much.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"There's a reason why so many of the restaurants in town get their coffee from Anderson's - it's awesome. Tons of choices, something for everyone! I make a point of going by every other week for my espresso, and usually get other stuff as well. I love to support this Austin-based business!",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Gourmand perfection. The Smell, which has been the same Smell for decades, is divine! Delicious roasted coffee, chocolate, tea, all warmed together in an intimate wood floored, wood shelved 2 room store, located in the charming Jefferson Square shopping complex. Their coffee is delicious, too.",1
Coffee Shop 2,"Only place my partner and I go to buy our coffee.  Their Italian espresso is delectable.  The smell and the taste are beyond any other coffee I have tried.  Great staff, and I highly recommend this place for buying your coffee.  It is not a sit down place, but Russells next door serves Anderson coffee :)",1
Coffee Shop 2,"This is a really cool place to buy coffee and tea related products.  This review ONLY covers the brewed coffee.  I thought, what a bargain at $1!  Unfortunately, no whole milk to put in the coffee - only half and half.  The coffee was bitter and way to strong.  I dumped it on the street on the way to my car, and was disappointed that this mecca was so disappointing.",0
Coffee Shop 2,Fantastic place to buy coffee beans.,1
Coffee Shop 2,"Just walking into this fine establishment is a privilege and a treat. The wood floors, the amazing smell of roasted beans, and colorful display of coffee and tea accessories make this place a real delight. They have a great selection of a multitude of roasts, a helpful staff, and incredibly fair prices. It's a basic place but one of my favorite places to shop in the world.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Very cite little coffee shop with some of the best Costa Rican coffee. It was walking distance to my airbnb in Clarksville, great walk in a a very nice neighborhood.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Great Places to Read, Study, and Ingest Some Goodness., Yelping in 2016, Audacious Austin What a lovely coffee shop in Austin! It's not a Starbucks, but it has class, amazing coffee, service, and comfort.  I was able to sit at the counter without ever getting bumped and enjoyed my almond latte while reading my kindle.  It wasn't too loud, and it was a place I could lose track of time. It was lovely - - I hope to return to this lovely establishment the next time I'm here. Decaffeinated almond milk latte. ..yummy!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Really enjoyed my visit here at Caffe Medici. My cappuccino was smooth and delicious. This place is also spacious and even has a second floor. Love the decor and the ambiance. The backwall benches with wooden small tables were a nice touch. There are a few tables outside, but with the heat during the summer in Austin, it may be better to stay in the air conditioned area.  Cheers! Nice place. Spacious too. See all photos from Edwin R. for Caffé Medici",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Quick Eats, I Love You So Matcha, Keep Austin Weird I was taken here by a colleague who knew I appreciated the third-wave coffee generation. Caffé Medici serves espresso from Spyhouse Coffee Roasters (from Minneapolis) and their house coffee is Wild Gift Coffee, a local coffee roaster in Austin. They do French pressed coffee, cafe au lait, iced coffee, toddy, and the usual espresso drinks. In addition, they also serve iced tea, hot tea, and hot chocolate. And if that wasn't enough, they have beer on tap.  I love the interior. It's lofty and there's lots of seating. My favorite has to be the coffee bar, where the baristas work their magic while you sit around the bar and relax. I love all the wood everywhere, from the floors to the walls to the tables and chairs. It's gives off a very warm and cozy atmosphere.  I ordered a latte and a walnut scone. Both were really good and the perfect pick-me-up for a long work day. If you're in downtown Austin and need some a good cup of Joe, stop by Caffé Medici.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Definitely was not expecting to like this spot as much as I did and I'm glad my fellow Texas CM pal, Luci ,recommended this spot to me!  Situated in the heart of downtown, you can find plenty of cheap parking nearby so you won't have to dread walking a few blocks to get here. In all seriousness... walking in ATX is never a bad thing and I love the views of downtown.  This double decker coffee house not only has seating downstairs but a few community and small tables upstairs. The drinks were good and was very happy about the availability of Hibiscus Iced Tea and their coffee variations.  The ordering of your coffee at this spot is a little different than most but it's very easy to catch on for us newbies that visit.  You'll want to walk towards the very back, past the first coffee bar you see. Once you order your drinks, your name will be called at the front coffee bar and then voila! A drink with your name on it (not literally, it's not starbucks) will be ready for you.  If you need wifi they have it and yes it's free.  Drinks were very reasonable and the environment was superrrr chill. I honestly was impressed with their music and got caught away when they started playing 80s music. Points for playing Eurythmics btw.  Austin's coffee scene has always been superb and I'm glad to have another spot on my rotation. The staff was great and very personable which makes me want to go back on my next visit.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Texas, 2016 Reviews, ATX, Hangout spots, When in need of caffeine... We stopped by Caffe Medici for some much needed caffeine and to while away a half hour or so before heading to see the famous bats.  I liked the space and the iced coffee I ordered was delicious. The wait can be a bit long since they clearly try to perfect your order and perfection sometimes should not be rushed. If you were in a hurry, this could be very frustrating. However, as mentioned, we were trying to kill as much time as possible. Therefore, the friendly barista's pace was not something that made us impatient.  We sat upstairs and tried to watch the traffic on Congress. It was not overly interesting, but this afforded us an opportunity to relax and not rush (which was what we mostly did during our Austin visit).  Caffe Medici gave us a chance to slow down, reenergize with amazing coffee and that was much appreciated. Until next time! Looking down Congress",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Consistence!  This place is probably one of the most consistent coffee places I've been too.  I consistently order a soy cafe au lait, and it is always delicious, and always tastes the same.  The service is always consistently friendly too, and I see a lot of the same faces working there.  I will consistently return as much as I can, given my finances and their consistent, yet justifiable in quality, higher prices.  Peace and love to Cafe Medici on Congress",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Macchiato on point, served with a sliver of wafel. Interior is open and perfect for taking a breather to people watch. Plenty of seating options as there is a second floor. Will definitely come back if ever I'm in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Good bottled kombucha. Outdoor seating. Friendly staff. Great place to study or work.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"I come to this Caffe Medici every time I come to Austin and need a place to kill a few hours downtown, not only is the coffee amazing but the service is great, and there is always plenty of seating / outlets upstairs to get some work done.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Needed a place to unwind for an hour and spend time with a book. I ordered a vanilla latte and the flavors with rich and bold. Even the foamy head was tasty and I typically am disappointed anytime there is foam on my drink. The staff was pleasant and seemed to know the regulars well. In comparison to Starbucks...I received about four ounces less than I would get at Starbucks for the same price BUT....the taste buds didn't mind. This was the best coffee drink I've had in quite awhile. The location also allowed me to people watch a bit....and when in Austin that is a must! I highly recommend Cafe Medici and would return without hesitation. I found art in my coffee!,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Something has happened to this place over the last few months.  They used to boast pretty good espresso's and coffee products in general, and the last few times they have unfortunately had coffee makers there who seemed to take the namesake of the place to heart (you know the Medici's in Florence and their reputation ....) and inflict sub par coffee on you.  The last Sunday was nuts when they apparently did not have the coffee they listed but made a french press that was the color of dishwater and I wish it was dishwater, because it might have had better flavor.    I guess what was annoying was that this was a generally pretty standard place before and we took friends there leading to my rep taking a hit! not cool.  But will give it a shot again in say 30 days and see what's up. Coffee or dishwater?",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Had to go here given the history of the Medici family in Florence and see if their cappuccinos would live up to the name. I was pleasantly surprised! Delicious creamy cap and if you get it to stay they give you a piece of a stoop waffle (king of random given its a Belgium dessert not Italian, but not going to complain) which is a nice plus. The name brought me back to Italy! I miss Florence but the quality of their espresso helped! Delicious creamy cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Don't come here if you're in a rush. It felt like forever before my order came up and it wasn't even busy. You order at the cashier and the barista area is in the middle of the shop with a bar area surrounding it. We posted up there and waited and waited before my latte was called out. It felt like forever and since the person I was having a meeting with had ordered drip coffee, it was certainly annoying that I had to wait so long to have my drink... our meeting was almost over at that point!  Nevertheless, the latte was quite good and the shop had a nice atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Incredible coffee joint. If you're looking to relax in the middle of a big city, come here! There's tons of seating, the building is very open, and there's an upstairs loft with lots of seating too. The baristas were super friendly and the brew was beyond words. We got an iced mocha and a hot vanilla macchiato. The vanilla they use is off the charts, tastes like real, pure vanilla bean!! Great, great spot. The ONLY criticism I have is the drinks are a little pricey, it was $5.20 for a medium mocha! But worth it.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Best of Austin Great place to sit and study or work or hang out with friends!  Seating upstairs and downstairs!  Delicious pastries and Tacodeli tacos!  Great coffee - in particular, I love their cappuccino and cortado!  Very modern and sleek interior!    On Congress, so good luck parking!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"this coffee shop was a bit confusing at first, you order at the cashier but the barista was in a totally separate area. I still cant figure out how the order gets transferred but I may have missed the computer or system but needless to say I ordered a latte and it was amazing. I ordered a latte w Sugar Free Vanilla and it was very tasty, light and had a cute design created with the foam.  there is good seating downstairs as well as an upstairs area with extra seating. The place gets busy around the 9 and 10 am hour.  They serve these breakfast tacos which were amazing! I had the egg, potato and cheese w salsa verde, they are the perfect size for breakfast! Latte and it's yummy!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins Caffe Medici is a great downtown cafe hangout spot.  Whether you want to catch up on some work in their naturally lit comfortable spacious second floor loft, or chill with friends.  Their coffee is great.  The espresso drinks are made from an exclusive Cuvee blend.  They utilize Temple beans for their French Press coffees, and Ruby for special pour overs.  In the morning they have a selection of Tacodeli breakfast tacos to choose from.  Or, a few baked goods, which includes gluten free items from my favorite Blackbird Bakery. I managed to grab their last muffin of the morning.   They also have beers on tap and a happy hour from 4-7pm (if I remember right).  During happy hour they have a special happy hour coffee drink blended with a milk stout nitro.  For those non beer drinks, they did have East Austin Cider available in cans.  This is one of many great coffee options downtown.  The do some beautiful coffee art as well here, even for the to go orders.  Just walk to the back register to order your drink, and then wait at the coffee bar for your order to come up. Two floors for seatting Pastry section - Gluten Free Blackbird Bakery and Tacodeli breakfast tacos See all photos from Mindy H. for Caffé Medici",1
Coffee Shop 8,Trendy coffee shop with local and organic products. They have beer on tap too. My only suggestion is that it would be useful if they had napkins/sugar/straws upstairs too. Latte,1
Coffee Shop 8,"The perfect coffee bar.  These guys are serious about their craft and always welcoming.  In a city with lots of coffee choices Medici stands out.  Consistent, excellent espresso and great coffees.    And it's open early.  An Austin original!  Open at 6am on weekdays.    Pros: - Dynamite coffee and espresso - You are always welcome by a friendly and knowledgeable staff - Breakfast tacos from Taco Deli and excellent pastries  Cons: - I can't not mention parking downtown - Who doesn't need more electric plugs...  Treat yourself and enjoy this wonderful shop.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I don't drink coffee, only tea so take this review as you wish. I ordered a hot chai latte and it was not good at all. I didn't even finish most of it. Maybe the coffee is better, but avoid ordering the chai latte. I noticed people who ordered lattes had pretty latte foam art - that was cool.",0
Coffee Shop 8,The staff is always super friendly and I love that their mocha latte's aren't too sweet and they make the chocolate sauce in house.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Very different from the Guadalupe Caffe Medici. It feels much lighter, cleaner, and modern at this location - definitely matches the surrounding downtown neighborhood. The interior design was beautifully done.  The bakery case was stocked with cookies, cakes, and sandwiches from local bakeries. The baristas were knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations. They use Cuvee coffee here which makes a delicious latte.  There were plenty of tables and outlets for people to get comfortable with their coffee date, their textbooks, or their laptops. This location is quieter and much less busy than Guadalupe, understandably as it's not right off campus and parking in downtown is tougher. Raspberry Italian soda",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Jackpot ! Came to downtown before my flight out. Needed a good coffee some place with wifi to get some work done. Easy parking, nice and clean, two story with modern design and friendly staff and gooooodd coffee.. Not that many choices to eat so don't come here hungry.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"As an avid espresso drinker, it's always a nice surprise when a coffee shop delights you with the perfect drink.  Caffe Medici did just that with their espresso macchiato.  The crema was perfectly reinforced with an exact dollop of foam harmonizing the idea macchiato.  As a bonus, the atmosphere was smart and clean encouraging a productive afternoon.  The chairs were comfortable, wifi was fast and staff super friendly.  Thank you for breathing new life into the coffee shop business. a perfectly made espresso macchiato",1
Coffee Shop 8,This place is a TWO AT BEST. On Saturday there was a average crowd and they had one person making every single drink which took FOREVER. I felt bad for the barista she plugged away while another staff member worked a register across from the coffee bar... WHY? Terrible system that stresses the employee and pisses off the customer.,0
Coffee Shop 8,"Officially, my favorite coffee place in Austin! Their vanilla latte tastes so amazing, even with skim milk! Their coffee is very high quality. The decor is also very nice... Sleek and modern. Love it!!!! Delicious latte! Makes me happy and awake :)",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Our favorite coffee shop in Austin! The coffee here is legit. We had the latte and macchiato. Both had excellent flavor (a bright, smooth espresso taste.) I don't really understand the other reviews that didn't like the coffee here. I thought it was excellent.  Beyond the coffee itself, the shop is airy, clean, and well designed. There's a variety of seating available.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins The servers had a pomp and self worth greater than or equal to Medici royalty.  Each subtle sarcastic comment I wedged in response to this was quickly volleyed back with no remorse.  This small coffee shop on congress is full of narcissistic attitude from the business lounge casually dressed handsome clientele poised on couches showcasing engaging conversations aware of the leather to the hipper than thou pretty and independently stylish women behind the counter.    The espresso was good but all this unfriendly self importance isn't the way I want to think of Austin.  Unfortunately with its urban development, Austin is still as weird as Tom Cruise - a polished product out to win it all with the sacrifice of a soul.  Maybe they should change the name of this coffee shop to ""cafe of the black eyed children.""  Coffee and pastries offered in a sleek clean space that has the feel of an expensive car dealership.",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Great location in Austin. Quiet, relaxed atmosphere. Very good coffee, cappuccino and espresso drinks. I recommend the iced Americano. Creating a proper espresso based drink takes time, and they do it right. So sit back, relax and enjoy... Cheers!",1
Coffee Shop 8,This is a cute modern coffee house located in downtown Austin. Nice place to sit and chat with a friend or study. Lots of available seating space which is nice. I ordered a chai latte. It was much spicier than I was expecting but still lovely.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Lots of space, modern looking interior, comfortable place in downtown. Ordered an iced latte; the milk overwhelmed the espresso a bit, still satisfying quality. Need to try other drinks to make a valid evaluation of the coffee here.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Best latte I've had. Maybe ever. Plus nice staff and chilled atmosphere (at least on Sunday morning).,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Upon walking in I was greeted by a very pretty barista, although I'm bummed I forgot her name - short blonde hair, GORGEOUS smile- bc I wanted to give her credit. I LOVE espressos in the afternoon, but had never heard of ristretto and the other word. Anyways I asked about a ristretto and instead of looking at me with the Coffee-Snob look you can get at other high end cafès (albeit usually in Dallas -_-) she was very sweet and explained everything in an unrushed courteous manner. I ordered a double of the special they had going, it was robust yet suttle and smooth. Very delicious! I told her we were walking all over Austin (warm day) to do the Day of Gluttony (24 restaurants in 24 hours) and she was gracious enough to provide a topo chico on the side! Topo makes everything better..... 5 star.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Hands down best coffee I've found in Austin. I've had a cortado, cappuccino, and a latte. As well as a couple of pour overs...not all at once mind you, I don't have a death wish. Ha. Medici's does all of them wonderfully. The baristas are incredibly friendly. Customers range from the hipster types, students, to people in suits, as well as families...a good sign in my opinion, as quality coffee draws all types of people. There are plenty of places to sit, both upstairs and downstairs. Also, highly recommend the croissants (especially almond), they're amazing. Heaven.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Wonderful cafe with a generously spacious interior, decent wifi, and most importantly, coffee with full-bodied flavor and verve. We also loved the design and branding.  I miss this place now that I'm back home in California.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins If I lived in Austin, I think I would go here every single day.  We stumbled upon Medici while exploring the downtown area and, being in need of a caffeine fix, decided to stop in. The space itself is great. I loved the open feel and adequate seating space. There are few things worse than a good coffee shop that doesn't have anywhere to sit! The setup was a little unique, with orders being taken at one counter towards the back, while drinks are prepared at a larger central bar. I actually think this is a good idea as it probably reduces congestion during peak times as people wait for their drinks.  I was craving iced coffee so I kept it pretty simple. I was not at all disappointed. I usually drink hot coffee black, but iced coffee with cream and sugar due to its inherent bitterness. This iced coffee was barely bitter at all, and did not require much of anything to be added. Because of this I am assuming it is cold-brewed, which makes a huge difference.  My friend ordered a mocha, which I tasted and also found to be delicious. It was made to be just barely sweet, which is perfect.  On top of the great coffee, the service was also quick and everyone we encountered was friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This is a lovely spot with great seating. Check out the upstairs area which is clean, airy, and you get that perched-up-top feeling. Decent amount of electrical outlets.  I like the breakfast burritos they sell. Good stuff.  Bathrooms were clean and well-appointed. I enjoyed using them.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Take Someone for Coffee Upon entering Medichi, I automatically loved the look and feel of this cafe. The ambiance was very laid-back. There was a lot of natural light, and I loved the clean appearance of the cafe. There is definitely a LOT of seating at this location; there's plenty of room downstairs, with an upstairs lounge, as well as a small front patio.  The service was great, although I felt like the barista wasn't as friendly. The speed of the cashier was efficient, but it took 25 minutes just to get a latte, granted it was a Sunday morning (Perhaps it's a little busier during a brunch hour).  I ordered a cappuccino, and I was impressed with the velvety milk and delicious espresso. Not bitter at all! Not to mention, the barista made some beautiful latte art. I didn't get a chance to try any of the snacks, pastries, or breakfast tacos, but it all looked great! Definitely a good spot for coffee and a quick snack or breakfast.  The location of this cafe was very accessible and a great spot in downtown. Unfortunately, you have to rely on street parking to get there. A view from the upstairs lounge area. A lovely cappuccino!",1
Coffee Shop 8,2 check-ins Nice atmosphere and convenient downtown location with decently priced and artfully crafted coffee. Recommended. Austin has some great coffee options. This is one.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"This is definitely my go-to spot whenever I'm downtown and looking for a nice coffee venue to do my work. They commonly host musicians to play while you're enjoying coffee and taking in the downtown views.  Their coffee is great although it doesn't stand out as much when compared to other coffee shops in Austin ( Summermoon anyone? ) but I truly enjoy the atmosphere they provide. There is additional seating upstairs and for the most part, it's never too crowded when you go there which is also another reason why I like this spot.  Definitely would recommend this spot.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Best iced coffee I've had in my life - amazing flavor. It was perfectly chilled with just the right amount of ice added. And they use crushed ice. Yes, crushed ice!",1
Coffee Shop 8,I swing by here before work for a morning coffee or latte.  They have plenty of plugs and plenty of seating.  Never seems to be terribly crowded.  The drinks are as good as most other coffee shops.  Prices are what I'd expect at a coffee shop in the middle of downtown.,1
Coffee Shop 8,Nice cafe. Rude employee ruined experience.  Visiting from out of town. Stopped in to have a drink on a hot summer day.  Greeted by an unfriendly employee who was rude and derogatory.  Attitude was absolutely unnecessary and inexcusable for a customer service driven store.  Would be hesitant to return to this cafe in any circumstance.  Where is the zero star option?,0
Coffee Shop 8,"Shout out to Santiago for paying it forward! Last week my friend Lindsay invited me to meet her for coffee as I was leaving the gym. I didn't have my wallet with me as I was planning on simply going to and from working out. She said she got me except for when it was time to pay, her card only allowed for payment of half of the total! She was having ""bank issues"" so could not transfer any money either. Santiago turned a slightly embarrassing moment into an act of kindness by telling her not to worry about the rest. He did not act annoyed nor cancel the order & even went to the back to grab us some stickers we asked for with the order. Way to go on the customer service front! Will definitely remember this and be back (with my wallet ;-)",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Hands down, best Chai Tea Latte that I've ever had and I'm so sad that I won't be able to get it back home in New York City.

I loved my drink, the selection of breakfast tacos and the gorgeous interior decor.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Great, local Austin coffee shop.  Stopped in here on a visit to Austin because I wanted to check out a local coffee shop. The interior was clean and spacious and there is outdoor seating as well. Was hoping to try some Tacodeli tacos but they had run out by 10:30-11ish. The iced coffee was fantastic. I ordered a chocolate croissant which was not the best I've had (too much chocolate) but overall this is a great little coffee shop that is worth checking out.",1
Coffee Shop 8,I come here every Sunday an i get so much work done. The coffee is on point and the service is even better. A perfect place to get work done and unwind.  On Sundays morning there are little people mainly the regulars.  i would say try there chi but get it dirty.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Been visiting Austin for the week, this has been the best espresso I've found. The barista wasn't measuring out grams like other shops do, he wasn't using an automated tamper, nothing fancy, just experienced hand at the machine. The shot was served quickly, with a side of cookie and sparkling water. The shot started out with a subtle crisp sweetness, the lovely bittersweet mark of a great blend of beans. The crema was present but not overwhelming. Good temperature.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I am a drip coffee drinker and really appreciate a good cup of simple coffee. I was in town for a conference and sampled both Houndstooth and Medici.  No question, Medici had the better coffee. And a downright great cup of drip compared to any coffee shop.  I had a cup a day every morning I was in town and would recommend it to others downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Subpar service with a smile.  Coffee is decent but the unwelcome presence is not cool,0
Coffee Shop 8,"They take paypal here which is why originally came, to take advantage of a couple 8 dollar coupons.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but the espresso I had was good and strong.    They've got a few sandwiches to choose from that are ready made and pretty tasty.  The curry chicken salad and provolone pesto turkey were both good in a pinch for lunch.    The place is clean, quick and modern.  Check them out! And energy bars They have sandwiches!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"yeap, I am a fan...cool open loft feel space with a chill vibe. You can cool off on a hot day which while I stay in Austin was everyday. The staff is sweet. Perfect spot to relax and red a book for a while while listening to good vibes in the background.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Nice place - good music, comfy couches for lounging plus some sturdy spaces for working and meeting... nice little patio, too.  I love the cortado... one of my favorite coffee drinks but hard to find.  (Starbucks says it's the same as the espresso macchiato, but definitely not.)  Knowledgeable and friendly staff... Maybe I just wish they had a bit more seating, and I think that the layout of the place can get a little weird (have to walk to the back in order to place an order).  I've never had any of the food here... but a nice place to stop for coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Do you wanna enjoy a great coffee in a european style cafe, so you are on a right spot. This is a great and lovely place to be and you will enjoy your experience with no doubt",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Espresso.. Just because it is overloaded with caffeine doesn't make it good. It was sour, no depth in flavor. The aroma was ok, but no richness, texture... all the important parts were missing. Even the hole-in-the-wall corner cafe in Rome had better espresso.  One more thing.. I really felt uncomfortable to give tips at the register when the payment screen was presented to me to write tips and sign. I usually don't mind leaving some tips, but this was too aggressive. I will not go back.",0
Coffee Shop 8,"Hands down, the best coffee in Austin. I ordered a small latte with almond milk, plus an extra shot. The latte was rich and silky. The space is posh. Customers order from the register counter, but wait for their drinks at a large, separate espresso bar. I ordered my drink to go, but will definitely be back to enjoy the ambience and the upstairs loft. Thanks for the quality espresso!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I feel like Texas is an espresso state. Single origin drip coffee doesn't seem to have made its way here yet. I was in town and wanted coffee, and Caffe Medici just called out to me when I looked on yelp, even if it was a bit out of the way.  So we took our chances.  As soon as I saw cyclists hanging out on the patio outside with their nice bikes on a Sunday morning, I had high hopes for this place. The drip coffee (pourover via clever brew) was very nice, though I'm not sure if it's the bean itself or the brew that made a cup that soured unpleasantly as it cooled.  The ambiance and decor in here is amazing. Upstairs has tables and ample floor outlets (so jealous!) and downstairs an espresso bar - an actual bar that serves espresso, and giant windows for natural lighting.  We remarked that our grades in college would've been so much better if we had a space like this to get work done. It's everything I look for in a work environment, except that the tables upstairs are a bit small.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Hey this is just a warning about their sxsw schedule! They're currently closed til March 16. :(  Gotta go to campus or west Lynn til then! Don't bother fighting the traffic these next few days just to find it temporarily closed.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"7 check-ins Listed in Coffee Shops in Austin As a student, I prefer this Medici to the one next to campus. This place is much better lit, has enough outlets for everyone upstairs, and most importantly this place isn't crowded during work hours (around 9am-5pm).  Every time I come here (about twice a week), I am able to find a table and an outlet to get a few hours of work done. That's more than I can say about the other Medici!  The coffee, like all Medicis, can be better, but that's the cost of a great working area. The noise level is also pretty high here because of all the meetings taking place and the open layout so I recommend bringing headphones.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Yet another Yelp-sourced score in Austin!!!  I'm pretty open about my coffee snobbery, and have come to terms with how it negatively impacts my life. It's rare that I'm satisfied, no less impressed, with an espresso drink. Unless I walk in to a place like Cafe Medici, and have my taste buds rocked by an awesome cappuccino!  The whole experience here is exactly as it should be. Ordering is quick and easy, they have tasty snacks if you find yourself getting ""hangry,"" and the baristas are on prominent display as they work their magic. The coffee is expertly made and perfectly presented, whether you order in-house or to-go. The flavored are rich, chocolaty, and free of bitterness. The milk is velvety and full of love, as the heart on the top of your cap will tell you.  Bravo for creating such a fun, accessible, and delicious downtown coffee spot as this. You'll be seeing a lot of me on this trip, you wonderful baristas, you! To-go is still awesome! Lots of love in this cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I think I would live here if I could.  For a coffee shop, it's got it all - great espresso, friendly baristas, and amazing space. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it is so downtown it can be hard to find a parking space.  Anyway, out of all the coffee places I've been to in Austin, Caffe Medici is in the top 5. They grind a special Cuvee blend which they have dialed in to perfection and will graciously make into a fabulous espresso drink of your choosing. It is also one of the few places I will go for a cortado because their making of it is impeccable.  Caffe Medici changed my mind about espresso, because it was one of the first places I went to that made it taste good.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge, The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Caffé Medici, you're pretty cute.  I really like their hot chocolate. It's everything hot chocolate should be. It's rich without being overpowering and it's smooth. The raspberry Italian soda is also pretty tasty - it's light and refreshing and I imagine it would be quite good on a hot summer's day. I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on their coffee drinks.  The atmosphere is very open. I feel like I can have a quiet conversation here and no one will care, but I can also come here to get work done, if necessary. The upstairs seems to be a quieter spot to allow for more focused working while the downstairs lounge and bar offers a better setting for conversation.  You order at the counter in the back and pick up your drinks at the bar in the center. They also have a rewards card - for every ten drinks you buy, you get one free. I don't have a rewards card, but my friend does and he makes great use of it.  Now that I'm no longer a student, I have little reason to visit coffee shops except for meeting friends. My friend really enjoys coming here since he is still a student, and sometimes I get to tag along. (Gotta get out of the house sometime, you know?)  Parking can be tricky since it's downtown, so I recommend walking, taking the bus, or riding your bike. Parking isn't impossible, but depending on what's going on downtown on any given night, it can be a pain. (I don't mind since I enjoy walking downtown, but I know that's not for everyone.)  I'm not a coffee shop connoisseur, but this place is welcoming, the drinks are good, and the service is excellent. Hot chocolate",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Sweet (and quick!) service. Almond milk is an option, chill music, power plugs, and air conditioning! Had an iced almond milk chai that was pretty damn good (good balance of spices), and got some work done before my flight out of town. Just what I needed!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"This is a very good place to get some work done in downtown Austin. Honestly, I didn't try the coffee as I had just had some elsewhere. But the hubster said it was good.  I really liked the modern decor and want those green chairs!!!! Where can I get them???  Seemed like a great meeting/working place for many of the customers that came in.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Caffe Medici has an interesting set up--they have a bar area in the center of the shop with another area to order coffee near the back of the first floor. There is also a second floor with plenty of area to find an area to sit down if the first floor is filled up. I've personally preferred sitting on their couch or sitting at one of the tables near the big glass window on the first floor--it's nice to occasionally ""people watch"" (promise I'm not a creeper!)  The service here is impeccable--I once didn't use a Paypal app correctly here so I could use the discount they were offering. They were kind enough to credit back me the amount swiftly and get everything straightened out. The prices here are slightly higher than other coffee shops but with the premium price, you get what you pay for.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"Staff was very friendly.  The barista gave a good description of the products I was interested in so I'd say he was knowledgeable.  Not a very busy place in the evening on a weekday.  There is a nice place to sit outside and watch all the tourists and locals stroll, jog and bike by as its situated close to the capital.  House coffee is pretty good, about a medium roast.  Wouldn't mind having a cup every day.  Would be great with a bread type pastry, like a bagel but not a doughnut.  The chai-tea, while fresh wasn't full of flavor, Starbucks has a better one if you're looking for something with a strong flavor. House coffee is good, about a medium roast.

Coffee Shop 8,"My quest for a decent cup of coffee in downtown Austin was starting to feel like ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.""  Every place I found on Yelp either wasn't open or wasn't there. Then I happened upon this little gem.  I had possibly the best latte of my life!  And I am a person who really knows and appreciates good coffee.  Sure it took a while to get my latte. When I tasted the magnificent concoction I realized the wait was due to the effort the barista put into achieving the perfect taste and temperature.  And He even put a foam heart on top. Delicious latte and blueberry muffin!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"If they were 10 stars instead  of 5 , I will rate this place a 10. Best cappuccino I had in many years, also I ate a delicious croissant that I know it was homemade.  Been in many cafes in USA and abroad. So far the best in Austin and one of the best I had before.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins Listed in Awesome Austin Got a mocha with skim milk and I was surprised at how light it tasted. I couldn't taste the heaviness of the chocolate syrup, which enlightened me because sometimes some places make it so that it masks the taste of the latte, which destroys the whole point of getting a coffee. So delicious and worth the money.  This branch is a great cafe. A lot of open space and light so it makes it the perfect place to do work or study or to meet you with a friend.  The baristas are also very friendly and knowledgeable. Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation!",1
Coffee Shop 8,I've worked at 4 coffee shops. This was seriously one of the best damn cups of coffee I have had in a long time.  The barista even made a little heart shape into the foam. Worth the price and the hassle of finding a place to park downtown.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"This location has more of a cold atmosphere to it, for sure.  I work in a cold office environment already and would love an escape wen I sneak away for some caffeine.  The quality of the brew is just as good as the other location, and I understand it's in an industrial building and not an old house like the Clarksville location, but I'm a bit sad that I can't tuck away in it and feel cozy.  I do like all the natural light.  On a side note, the inside reminds me sooo much of my days spent in Insomnia on the drag in high school and college. It's the less dingy, smoke free, and friendlier version of the same floor plan.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"3 check-ins Listed in Mmm, I got that suhweet tooth!, Texan Treasures, coffeecoffeecoffee, Austin, TX I had the opportunity to work out of this fantastic coffee shop recently. Located on the the southern side of Congress St., I still felt like I was in the downtown area but was able find parking fairly easily!  The sound system here is incredible and whomever was manning the playlist while I was there did a great job of picking some pretty jazz for my ears. There was a point when I looked around thinking there was a live band playing in a corner of the shop!  Once you walk in, don't go to the coffee bar to order -rather go to the back to a small desk with pastries and a cash registrar to place your order. I've had their mocha, straight up regular coffee, and a shot os espresso. Every drink hit my caffeine heart and had beautiful crema to top.  One day I worked from the lower level at the coffee bar and the next I worked from upstairs. The natural lighting in both settings paired with strong caffeine did my body good!",1
Coffee Shop 8,"2 check-ins Finding a coffeeshop in which you can actually work is a bit tricky - is it too loud or conversely, is it pin-drop silent? What about seating arrangements? And will the baristas act put out if you overstay your welcome?  I'm happy to report that Caffé Medici turned out to be the perfect space for our needs. It's a popular meeting place for many in the downtown area, so talking while we worked didn't feel disruptive as the scene is already a buzz-y one. I especially liked the high chair seating around the perimeter of the central coffee bar - sometimes, it's just easier to work next to each other instead of sharing a computer screen across a table. There's also an upstairs area if you're seeking a slightly more subdued atmosphere!  Coffee is outstanding - the latte was smooth and robust; just the right temperature. If you're hungry, the menu isn't extensive but they do stock Greek yogurt, buttery croissants and several varieties of tacos.  I have a feeling I'll be visiting this smart and stylish coffeehouse on the regular.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Conveniently located in downtown Austin. It's small but cute and most importantly the coffee is great. I love their cappuccino. The staff are very kind and friendly. There are seats outside also which is a plus.,1
Coffee Shop 8,"Excellent cappuccino brought me back three days in a row - smooth, caramely and maybe even a hint of smokiness?  Friendly servers but a bit disorganized/seemingly understaffed at times (water and cream dispensers empty; orders made not as they were placed); not as jazzed about the iced coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 8,Nice chill environment and good strong toddy. Nice place to take a break from the heat. :),1
Coffee Shop 8,"Cannot express my delight more for this place. Medici is the definition of impeccable from quality of coffee and espresso to the staff that work / manage the downtown location.   My experience here is exactly the same daily. Ordering is quick and seamless, fantastic snacks available,  and the baristas are well trained and execute very well on all drinks.  Regular coffee is french pressed, whether you order in-house or to-go.  They do have pour over if your looking for something more exotic.  The espresso is custom roasted from Curvee, a local roaster, and it is fantastic.  If you love bold favor and superior quality in your coffee this is the place to visit.    Thank you to the Austonian folks for creating such a great downtown coffee experience. Always look forward to seeing all your happy faces.",1
Coffee Shop 8,"I really am a fan of this place. It's near my office downtown--near enough for me to walk over--so I'll often meet a friend for tea on my lunch break. Sometimes I go alone and just sit in the outside café area and get some sun.  The jasmine green tea is delicious, hot or iced.",1
Coffee Shop 8,This location differs from its sister near campus. The design is even sleeker and the clientele is holding out-of-office meetings or reading leisurely (rather than for class). Same delicious coffee/espresso and knowledgable baristas. Sat on the patio which faces Congress!,1

Coffee Shop 8,"Listed in Eating in Austin I absolutely adore it! Granted, I always order my customary latte, so this review, in all honesty, will only concern that drink and CM ambiance, but the two are consistently amazing.  Trendy, minimalist, but laid-back feel of CM seamlessly weaves itself into what Austin is becoming. Add scrumptious coffee, and CM has a life-long fan in yours truly.  From what I read, food is not their forte, so I will have to check this upon my future visit. But, thus far, CM has been a pretty amazing spot to grab a cup of delightfully yummy espresso and milk, kick back on their patio or the mezzanine and people watch to one's heart's content.",1

Coffee Shop 8,"Pretentious but excellent coffee.  It's like a coffee bar.  The coffee was really good, and there's a lot of floor space so you're not cramped.  No one is sitting on their stupid laptops either.  It's like a real coffee shop for once.",1

Coffee Shop 8,"This place is cool! I'm visiting from out of town and it just so happens they serve Temple Coffee Roasters from Sacramento (where I'm from)! They get an extra star for that, but they do the coffee justice! Great atmosphere and cool baristas. I'd be a regular if I was local!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"What an awesome place! I have recently started to work from home more and really needed to get out of the house and off my couch. I started looking around for coffee shops and Flightpath popped up, right down the street from my house!  I decided to give it a shot today, and I can definitely say, I will be here a lot more in the coming weeks. Between the incredibly nice barista, to the loads of tables and power outlets.  I will say, this place fills up fast (Monday between 9:30am and 2pm) but it shouldn't be a major issue.  They have solid internet and more then enough food/snack/drink choices.  I would highly suggest this place for anyone trying to find a new office or place to relax.",1

Coffee Shop 25,"If you can find a spot, Flighpath is a great study place! Plenty of configurations of different tables located in both the front and back of the coffeehouse, as well as outdoor seating outside (which should be nicer and have less mosquitoes now that the weather is cooling down!)  Also, lots of outlets, big plus. Parking is super limited in the tiny lot up front, but there's plenty of street parking nearby and you can just walk over.  I highly recommend the New Orleans Iced -- it's really strong and really really good. They don't allow outside food, so you have to settle for their packaged snacks and a small display case of prepare food from other vendors.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Good place to study, however it can be really full on weekends. Their tomato soup was really good and filling and it was only 3 dollars! Tomato soups can tend to be salty for me depending on the restaurants but the one here was very savory and the soup and tea helped my throat since I had strep throat. Weird yellow lighting for pictures, but quiet atmosphere and can get a lot fo stuff done. Not a necessarily cute coffeeshop bu perfect for when you need to concentrate Tomato soup and raspberry hot tea",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Listed in So you're going to Austin.. I completely got my coffee-snob on here. Flightpath's coffee is amazing. We stopped in on a blazing hot summer day and before I could wipe the sweat off my brow the barista prepared our iced drinks. Wow, that was fast. Press that ice to your forehead and chill out, man. My iced mocha was sooooo good! It was just the right blend of coffee and chocolate thank you very much. And my coffee-snob-honey's drink was also really good. It tasted all the right vanilla and bold and cream. I'm literally craving some more of that delicious bev as I write this.  Anyways, the vibe is not over the top hipster but it's an eclectic alternative feel. Outside, the woodsy wrap around area is expansive. Didn't see that coming. I'm impressed. And now my man needs to go get his carpenter on and build me some.  His cup of joe should get him going on that. See all photos from Paisley B. for Flightpath Coffeehouse",1
Coffee Shop 25,"2 check-ins My go to coffee shop for getting some serious work done. They have a wide array of seating (couches, an assortment of chairs, and patio seating outside), and usually there are several empty spots available. To add, all of the spots are well within reach of an outlet or two, which is perfect for my not-so-portable laptop that requires nearly constant charging. When there isn't enough room for me to selfishly take up an entire table with books, laptops, and supplies,  there have always been friendly people that don't mind at all to share a table.  My coffee of choice has been their cafe au lait, which has never ever let me down, and the baristas that serve it to me with full friendliness make the experience even better each time I return. It may seem super random, but one of my favorite things about this place is that they don't have a standard set of coffee mugs. Each time I order, I am surprised by the new mug my order is served in, and I really love scoping out the variety of mugs other customers are sporting whenever I am zoning out from actually doing work.  They have a nice little selection of snacks and great discounts on refills for those who are in for some more serious lengths of time. I highly recommend checking this not-so-little shop out!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"This place is the shit. It's huge so you're bound to find a table to sit at (unless it's extra busy). I always get the New Orleans iced coffee, it's made with sweetened condensed milk and it's perfect. They also have a ton of snacks, coffee and beer, everything. They even have green tea kit kats (not gonna lie, i'm a sucker for those). Parking is tough to find but it's Austin so I don't know why anyone was expecting anything different. The employees are super nice. Make sure to check this place out!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Awesome coffee shop with tons of space to work or study in a calm cool environment. Had a creamy and well balanced Cafe Au Lait, and a super tasty sesame bagel that tasted very fresh. Will definitely be returning.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Wow, this is probably the most spacious and studying-friendly coffee shop I have found in the Austin area. Not only is there casual seating in the front foyer, but behind the bar there is additional seating along with a large number of outlets for your devices, and beyond that, there is a good amount of outdoor seating - both a bar that overlooks Duval as well as picnic tables and even more outlets.  I think what impresses me most about this place is just how accommodating it is for large numbers of people, along with the fact that it just has so much personality. Outside, there are hanging lights with CD's as the backing, and a painted mural of outerspace. The tables are decorated with small designs and drawings which is super cute.  The interior features a large, body-sized mirror and two bathrooms, and the two 'rooms' of tables are separated by a statement window-wall piece. It gives off a very hipster vibe inside with the colors and low lighting - perfect for getting work done.  Beyond just the general ambience, Flighthouse has parking in the back in addition to the spaces on Duval, and the staff was extremely friendly and immediately made me feel welcomed.  I tried the latte - which is interestingly served in a tall clear glass, despite being a warm drink. I wouldn't say it's my favorite latte ever, but it was really good. Not too rich on the coffee flavor, and a good balance of milk and foam.  I have a lot of good things to say about this place and will definitely return - it may even become a regular spot of mine! Outdoor space! Cute drawings on the outdoor picnic tables Hot latte in a tall glass - interesting",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Local spacious coffee house. It has very interesting decors, The inside seems plain but if you look up the ceiling, you'll be mind-blowed.

Lots of pastries and some sandwhiches, pizza, quiche and finger snacks. They have the whole shelf for interesting imported desserts!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Amazing menu, their dirty chai is really delicious. The only thing is, and it's really a pro and a con depending on when you get there, is that it's a cafe designed for sit down studying. I've studied there 2-3 times and it's great, but going there you can never be sure about there being a seat available. Also parking is very limited, you have to park quite far away from the cafe and walk there. I enjoy going there but sometimes just thinking about how difficult parking and finding a seat is, I opt for another coffeshop.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"2 check-ins This place is wonderful. We came here because the Beware trailer was closed and I'm very pleased that we did.  I liked the decor inside and ample seating outside.

It had a definite brownie flavor going on, that's going to make anyone smile.  I look forward to my next visit.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"I love this place despite the lack of parking out front! (it's Austin, what can we expect right?) I had an iced soy latte this morning and it was so delicious, just the right balance of coffee and milk for me personally. Their coffee is relatively cheap compared to other hipster coffeehouses that are becoming popular around austin, which is another great plus especially for college students like myself. I walked in to find tons of tables and chairs for studying and working alone or with friends. And, my favorite part, there were outlets everywhere! Even near the couches in the front of the shop. The baristas are so sweet as well. I am definitely going to make this a regular spot for the rest of the summer and all throughout the coming semesters! I can't wait to try the rest of the drinks on the menu. Excuse the snapchat quality, but I really enjoyed this iced soy latte today! Just the right amount of coffee and milk.",1

I think the back area is quieter than the front and most people in the back were working and not chatting. I can't say much about their snacks and drinks since I only got a latte which just tasted like a regular latte. Parking is very limited! Also it's not freezing cold inside so that's a plus. Mocha latte",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Listed in Coffee & Tea, Baked Goods and Zen Places This coffeehouse has some major swag and it just reps the Austin vibe. I don't know how to explain it but this coffeehouse is not meant for the tourist trap. Hell to the na- it's a genuine shop located in a true Austin neighborhood and not some Congress Blvd hype or downtown spot attracting everyone and their mothers.  Parking is scarce and most likely you'll need to park in the neighborhoods.  Once you walk in the feel is very warming and you'll find plenty of spots. Honestly I was shocked how huge this coffeeshop is. Almost like a Alice in Wonderland moment. To top it off they even have outdoor seating and a porch.  They have a great drink menu and the staff was on point. I digged how their drinks are based on the amount of espresso shots.  If I'm ever back in the neighborhood I'll make sure to swing by and get my work done.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"5 stars = staff 5 stars = atmosphere 4 stars = food/snack selection 3 stars = coffee  The three cafés I frequent the most are Flightpath, Epoch, and Houndstooth. I feel the most warm & fuzzies for Flightpath because they have the absolute friendliest and down-to-earth staff. I genuinely enjoy interacting with the baristas who are always cheerful and welcoming. I often walk here for a quick work break and it always made a pleasant interlude.  I always take my coffee to go but it seems like a good place to study/work.  The crowd that frequents Flightpath always seems engrossed in their stuff so I don't feel like I'm being watched as I come and go (unlike at Houndstooth where it feels very much like a ""see and be seen"" type of place). And they have a mouthwatering assortment of snacks to satisfy any craving you might have.  The one bad thing is that their coffee is not the best. It's definitely not terrible but it's the worst of the three. (Houndstooth has seriously stellar coffee and Epoch is decent but sometimes served with a side of hipster.) I love the lowkey ambiance and lovely baristas though, which I think makes up for it some.  I do like the Carrollton (I think it's called). It's a frozen blended coffee drink. A little icy but refreshing and yummy on a hot day.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Flightpath is a Coffeehouse that you don't hear about often. They aren't too hip, super centrally located, or pretentious, but they do have velvet paintings on the ceiling, LOOK UP.  They cater to a lot of the UT study crowd and the remote workers, because they have tons of seating. Don't be too shy to grab a four-top table with someone already working at it.  They have an assortment of food/drinks beside coffee, too. Eastside pies, juices, and breakfast tacos all make the list. Get there early for the tacos, because they sell out pretty fast.",1

The smoothie was really good, I was impressed with the taste!! The tacos were just as good as last time.  The front area of the coffeehouse is the ""louder"" section and the back is more quiet and focused. There are also plenty of tables outside under a roof. Plugs are available from almost every table and the wi-fi doesn't disappoint!  The only reason I don't rate this coffeehouse 5-stars is because of how poor the parking is. Granted, it seems to be a problem in Austin in general but it's still a hassle.",1

I have never come to a coffee house and had my latte served in a glass.  It's wonderful! I tried my husband's coffee. Very robust. The atmosphere is laid back. You can tell people come here to study, work, and research a lot. If I lived around this area, it would be my daily coffee spot. Beautiful chai tea latte. Tastes great too.

Coffee Shop 25,"Came here late on a Tuesday night...place was fairly empty so there was a plethora of seating options, inside and out. The inside had large tables with room for 4 people or a person, a drink, a laptop, stack of books, and a notebook which is what most people had on their tables. Plenty of space.  This place is quiet! If you are looking for a quiet study spot, this is it. If you're looking for a place to chat or play a board game...then I'd recommend coming here on a cooler day to sit out on the patio. It is a smoking patio, so be aware of that, but it's decent size so you can get away for the most part. Patio seating are picnic tables, large and small. Really cool decor.  The service was great. The barista was really nice, easy to talk to, ready to make a suggestion when I needed to decide between drinks. This time round, I had the New Orleans iced. Very tasty and refreshing. I meant to try the espresso but time slipped away from me while I was catching up with my friend. I'll be sure to try again soon and update.",1

You can park somewhere around the shop. When I went, I just parked street.  There are plenty of seats and tables. Only downside is that this place seems to be pretty popular. Often times it may be hard to find a free table. It's okay, you can always share a table with someone else :) Most of these tables can seat 4 people. A couple of the tables are a bit bigger. There are some couches in the front room. Outdoor seating is available. Most of the outdoor tables can seat 1-2 people. The bathroom was pretty clean. No complaints there.  Wifi is pretty decent. Obviously, the more people using it, the worse it gets, but it's pretty decent.  The staff was pretty friendly and helpful. I would also recommend the cold brew. Pretty darn good!  Overall, it was a great place to hangout, study. The noise-level is pretty low so you don't have to worry about blaringly loud music or really loud people.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Cool vibe coffee shop. Lots of seating available and lots of outlets. An excellent place to bring your laptop and do some work.  Also, the coffee is great. You can get really cheap refills on coffee (iced or hot) which I love as an inherently cheap person. We ordered a mocha as well which was delicious, smooth, and chocolatey.  I have no complaints about this place. It delivers everything you want in a coffee shop. Also Biscuits and Groovy is next to it, so if you get hungry, just walk on over.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"2 check-ins Wow.  Excellent place! 1) Staff--great friendly ladies serving me. Offered a generous free sample of their iced coffee with milk and sweetener. Convinced me to order that. 2) work space--ample and very hip. Formica!!  Many, many Formica tables. A huge back room. Plentiful outdoor seating in the shade. 3) Snacks--a good selection including raw and GF bars by a local place (Bearded Brothers--can you get any more Austin? No. You cannot!) 4) Coffee--the New Orleans I tried was cool, strong, sweet, refreshing, with a bit of vanilla (?) flavoring. I wish that I had had time to hang out here. Next time! Local energy bar and New Orleans iced coffee on one of their many Formica tables",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Service here is so friendly and they really try to make your stay memorable. My drip coffee was very good, although it could have been a little hotter. The chocolate chip scone was delicious and I loved their selection of european snacks. They have a chill outdoor seating area and the inside is cozy and perfect to spend an idle afternoon reading or a busy morning working. Good for working or relaxing Super friendly vibe and awesome coffee",1
Coffee Shop 25,"I love a coffeeshop that has kind baristas, comfortable seats, large tables, and good music. This place has all of that. They also have an assortment of good snacks and tacos in the morning. There is even a covered outside area and a quiet area in the back. These people know what they are doing. Definitely a great place to post up for a while and get a bunch of work done.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"I had to come here because a friend had mentioned it was a great place to study. As an old Epoch regular, I had to give it a try. There is so much space. It is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  Very nice and hidden coffee shop. Yummy drinks.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"5 check-ins Listed in 2015 Yelp 100 Challenge, The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! As I sit here, sipping my tart cherry melon kombucha and munching on some jalapeño kettle chips, I'm reminded of two of the worst dates I ever went on. Remember La Condesa guy? Yeah, like that guy, but a different type of awful.  A few years ago, I went on my first online date. I wasn't sure how I felt about online dating, but I promised some friends I was going to give it a shot. Luckily for me, the first guy that agreed to meet was only free on the night of my birthday. I explained that my parents were coming into town and I'd be running a marathon that weekend, so I couldn't stay out late or do anything crazy. He suggested Flightpath because it was close to his house and you can never go wrong meeting at a coffee shop.  We met up, get in line to order, and he orders and pays for his drink and then looks at me expectantly. He tells me to order. I am all about equality - I am always willing to pay for my own drink and I split the bill several times in the future on other dates. But this was different - there was no discussion beforehand. He didn't ask if we should split the bill. He just assumed. And on my birthday. If it had been on any other day, fine, but this was my birthday. I paid the $2.50 for my hot chocolate and then he commented on the fact that it was my birthday. The barista then told me she would have given it to me for free if she had known. Oh, well. I appreciated her kindness, but my date's kindness was sorely lacking.  The date was boring and I left after an hour or so to meet my parents. I had an easy out and I was thankful. I didn't have much interest in any further dates, but I figured I wasn't being fair. I hadn't talked with him for very long and I left early - maybe things would have gotten better once he loosened up? Maybe he was nervous?  I am far too nice sometimes.  I agreed to a second date - we met at Flightpath to get coffee and then we were going to get some beer and some food and make a night of it. We order our coffee separately, of course, and then walk to Duval market to get some beer. While he is paying for the beer, something amazing happens. He knocks his coffee over and it spills everywhere. All over the counter, all over him, some on the cashier - it was a coffee fountain that never stopped. I immediately started laughing - how could I not? I laughed so hard I was crying and my date was becoming increasingly more flustered. Now a line was forming and he was trying to hastily soak up the coffee with thin napkins, well aware that he was holding up the line. The more I watched him struggle, the more I laughed. He was now clearly annoyed with my laughter because he was embarrassed, but why couldn't he see how funny this was?  We left and ordered pizza - even though I mentioned I did not like pizza - and headed to pick it up. He made me pay, stating that he purchased the alcohol. Alcohol I wasn't even going to drink. (I drank very rarely those days and he picked a beer I didn't like, so I wasn't really planning on drinking anything.) Now I was annoyed. What the hell kind of date suggests we do all this stuff and then just springs the payment on the other person? He suggested East Side Pies and while I am very glad it led me to discover a type of pizza I'll actually eat, I was beyond irritated that we get there, walk up to the counter, pick up the pizza, and then he tells me, ""You have to pay for it."" Um, what? This wasn't my idea, I told you I didn't like pizza, and you didn't ask me if I would pay for it prior to us ordering! If he had asked, I wouldn't have been so irritated, but if he had asked, I would have suggested that we cook something together so I didn't spend over $20 on something I didn't even want to eat. (And he only spent $8 on the beer that only he was going to drink. Clearly a man who believes in fairness.)  There were no further dates because I was done with that douche.  On the other hand, I am not done with Flightpath. Flightpath has been nothing but sweet to me. They make an amazing hot chocolate and I can't wait to order it once the weather cools down a little more. The people working behind the counter have always been so friendly to me and I love that. I've always found a spot to sit and I love their covered patio. And the outlets - outlets everywhere! Outlets for everyone!  That guy was a total tool, but he did introduce me to Flightpath and East Side Pies, so it wasn't a total waste.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"I loved the place. Basically a magnificent place to engorge in studying for exams. One of the most alluring factors is the ability to open up a tab for coffee. That to me seems unheard of, so as I engaged in my readings it was amazing just to order continuous amounts of the decadent chai lattes in a seamless manner. The staff knew how to handle a lot of people and were amazingly friendly. They asked me what I was working on and when I closed my tab as to whether I completed it or not. It was the little gestures that earned this place the 5 stars. The wifi was also super fast which led to some procrastination but only helps the restaurant. I will be visiting again soon.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Just a fantastic coffeehouse who's exterior doesn't do the inside justice.  Warm, inviting atmosphere and a lot of space...you won't feel crowded at this place.  Houndstooth by comparison has all the charm of a new york subway at rush hour. I can only speak to the black coffee and a soy latte (for my wife) and both were great.  The lady who helped me was fantastic as well and treated me like a local.  I will miss this place when I'm back in Georgia.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"2 check-ins I love flightpath!!  I've been to a handful of the local coffeeshops around Austin, and this is by far my favorite. I like how affordable their beverages are ($1.75 for a small coffee, compared to over $3 at other places), the variety of snacks and food they have to offer, and the general character inside.  The only downside is parking, since there are only a few spots in the lot and you have to park a block away if you're going to stay, but the atmosphere and affordability is worth the short walk from 50th.  Another plus is having East Side Pies pizza available. It's a little pricey compared to their other offerings, over $3.50 a slice, but also some of my favorite pizza in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I think it's fair to say this one is overrun by students, but that makes for a quiet and concentrated atmosphere that I enjoy feeding off of. I have peace enough to read the Chronicle cover to cover, and sometimes leave a poem in my copy, hoping that some whimsy might loosen up one of these tense folks. The company is really the only con, contrary to what I said above, I know, but no one shows a sense of place here and interactions between strangers are limited, which can aggravate the seating issue (mentioned in other reviews) because most tables can seat up to 4 but are occupied by 1-2. I grabbed a vacant middle seat on the couch once and neither the person on my right nor left said one word. As for the coffee, I can speak to the greatness of the Double Americano/Topo Chico, which I have ordered five times. $4.25 with the cash discount. It's worth mentioning that they have a nice selection of bottled drinks and packaged goods that you can peruse without holding up the line. The baristas are nice always, especially when you have exact change. Another note on service: it is fast. My order is pretty straightforward, but the menu isn't for purists. There's an array of milk and syrup options, so they have to whip up some crazy shit. The people ahead of me today added to their order twice, and also forgot to mention that it was to-go, ugh, but I still waited less than 5 mins. Go team!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Stellar cold brew. Super spacious and quiet. Plenty of tables, chairs, outlets. Awesome patio. And they serve beer and wine!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"26 check-ins Flightpath has quickly become one of my favorite coffee shops to study at. What differentiates this coffee shop from others is the background music. I have realized that the music here is not nearly as loud as it is at other local coffee shops. This makes studying exponentially easier.  The furniture and ambience have an urban and hipster vibe, but so do most local Austin coffee shops. However, I do like how spacious the floor plan is. It allows for more tables/couches and therefore, more room for studying or socializing.  My favorite drink is the New Orleans Iced, which has a sweet mocha flavor to it. All of the food are from local vendors like Tacodeli and East Side Pizza. Overall, I always find the food to be quite delectable.",1
Coffee Shop 25,Great place to study and get some work done. Pretty popular and few tables available when I arrived. Park on the residential streets as a very limited parking space for the site. I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on the brews. Had the breakfast tacos which were decent enough to last me till I got a bowl of pho later.,1
Coffee Shop 25,Funky! Coffee was good.  Prices are good.  Ambiance was nice.   The place is huge with lots of tables inside.  There are almost no parking areas and I didn't see many places to put a bike but it's a pretty good shop with lots of offerings.   The only thing I didn't like was the dirty bathrooms and dim lighting.  Nice ppl and friendly cashier!,1
Coffee Shop 25,"So first of all, the staff was super sweet and ridiculously welcoming. They clearly make an effort to connect with their clientele, and it was charming. I had the New Orleans iced, which just seems to be a Vietnamese iced coffee, but it was awesome. A bit on the sweet side for an every day drink, but perfect when you're craving it.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"41 check-ins Listed in Austin Cafes, Austin Brunch Look, contrary to what my attitude may suggest, I don't hate people. Really, I don't! I just don't want to talk to them. And I'd rather not hear them talking, either. Flightpath, or rather, an introvert's oasis, is the first coffee house I've ever encountered that encourages this preference.  Even though there is plenty of seating (including couches,) it's usually pretty full. I've had to do the initially awkward ""can I share this table with you if I promise to be quiet?"" thing more than once. But that's the beauty of the coffeehouse: it can be crowded and quiet at the same time! My favorite seats in the house are up front where the windows are. The back tends to be a little on the warm side, and natural lighting is nil.  As for the coffee,  I love love love their vanilla latte. I don't know what they do differently, or if it's actually nothing special and I'm just enamored because I love the atmosphere so much, but whatever. It's great and I don't care why.  Oh yeah, and if you do happen to be of the extroverted persuasion, there is a large back patio perfect for talking/socializing/hanging out/whatever you strange people like to do.",1

If you're a person like me who needs to camp out at a table its great! I wish it was 24/7 like Bennu though.  I do have one complaint, today September 7. 2015 is Labor Day and of course I called in to see if they were open. The lady on the phone was very rude. She picked up and said ""Yes we're open"". Look, I understand you might be getting the same call all day, but its your job to be a good customer service rep. Do your job.",1

The regular iced coffee is at a price that can't be beat and the cold brew coffee has such delicious flavor it is worth splurging for. The people working are always so friendly and I can bring my dog and sit outside. What more does one need?!,1

Coffee Shop 25,"Almost 5 stars! I REALLY love this place. It's the only coffee shop in town that gets my creative juices flowing and makes me extremely productive. I work remotely, so I come here about 1-3x a week and sometimes stay for as long as 7-8 hours. I *always* get my work done here! and I know other people have that ""Flightpath Syndrome"" too cause it's usually the same old regulars coming in and out.  Awesome indoor & outdoor seating - and plenty of it! Lots of outlets to plug into + fun, eclectic lighting + mismatched tabletops. Really warm, positive vibes! They also serve the best chai latte in town. Most of the baristas are friendly, except for that one that looks like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark... Not sure how she fits into the awesome staff there - she's got a nasty attitude and is always rude.    The only other downside I would note is parking, but it's not terrible. There are about 4 spots up front and another 4-5 in the back, but you can always park in the neighborhood which is literally 20 feet away.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Stumbled upon this coffeehouse while in town from Dallas for ACL (10/10/15). My friend ordered a regular drip coffee and I ordered the New Orleans ice coffee. Both were delicious. I'm pretty sure I could drink a gallon of the New Orleans iced coffee. Yummm. I returned again on 12/7/15 while in town. Ordered both a large drip & New Orleans iced for myself...fuel for my drive back to Dallas. The staff on both visits were extremely friendly & helpful. Took the time to give me samples to help me decide. Made me feel like they were glad to serve me. Great customer service. I took my coffee to go on both visits, but the indoor seating and order patio both look like they would be comfortable for staying awhile. I seriously wish this place was in Dallas. I'll definitely be back on my next visit to Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"2 check-ins Sure, this place is just another trendy coffeehouse located in central Austin. Sure, there's nothing that sets this place apart from the rest but I still like coffeehouses & I still like this place. From its quirky artwork to its lamps made from old junk, it's definitely worth checking out if you're in search of a good cup of joe in the Hyde Park area. I discovered this place while laid off during the Government shutdown & if I lived in the area I'd be a frequent customer. What gives this place 4 stars is the attitude of the barrista when asking for a tea recommendation. I know that she ""wasn't a doctor"", but as a former barrista I know you're supposed to be able to describe your products. Luckily my experience helped me pick the right tea but it still irks me... Anywho, complaints aside I am still a fan of this quaint coffee shop & I highly recommend if you're in search of a caffeine jolt in Hyde Park! Even the pillars look fun! #Godzilla2014",1
Coffee Shop 25,"I felt like this place was larger than I expected to see from the outside, but even so, seating was VERY LIMITED. I went during hell week, so there were mainly students all studying and sipping on coffee! There's outside seating (where I sat), but it's open to smokers and I was unfortunately caught with someone who was smoking the entire 3 hours I sat there studying. (Smoking outdoors only) Coffee was good! I got a Chai latte (large) for under $5 which I consider a decent price! Lady who took my order seemed to be the owner or manager and was super friendly! Will be back (hopefully at a less crowded time) to try other foods and coffees! Sadly, there is limited parking, although I was lucky to get a seat right in front of the cafe. Otherwise, you would probably have to go across the street or somewhere further and walk some.",1

Coffee Shop 25,"2 check-ins Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure I LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's been around since it really was in the Mueller flightpath (forever ago.. ie - they have a myspace fan page vs. facebook and a hotmail email address vs. gmail)... but I digress.    Truly vintage vibe w/ 50's furniture & fixtures, **excellent** espresso drinks... which is what it's about, right?  Lots of little nooks for working and a ""quieter"" area in the back and a ""not-as-quiet"" area up front... plus the talkers and smokers on the 2 outdoor area. Outlets galore... table sharing OK, but there are lots of little places for 1 or 2 people and you don't feel guilty for being a hog.  They have pizza (East Side Pies), quiche, pre-made sandwiches, burritos & some other real food... plus fun imported chocolates & odd nibbles... then all of the heathy fruit & nut bars & cold drinks, just in case you are staying all day long and can't live on sugar and caffeine alone. (...meaning you are over 30).  Parking is a pain, but there is alley access - just don't tell people b/c I don't want to lose my good spot. I love the wall of ""to do"" things and I always get excited (usually post-espresso) of what an awesome city Austin is and how many cool things there are to do.  I love that I saw four different bike events and 2 triathlons mixed in w/ all the random liberal festivals, good causes and band gigs...  I am in denial that they are so close to my house or I may quit my job, go back to get my PhD and hang out there for 2-3 years. Wall of Austin-y To Do things...",1

Coffee Shop 25,This coffeehouse in Hyde Park rocks! The staff is super friendly and remembers their customers. The atmosphere is pretty chill and has great outdoor seating. Im a hge fan of their espresso to complement the greatest pastry of all time: THE CHOCOLATE CHIP SCONE  READ AGAIN: CHOCOLATY CHIPITY SCONEY.

Coffee Shop 25,"Flightpath is the quintessential spot to study, read, write, draw, or whatever other quiet thing you're into.  First of all, the coffee is good.  It's not a Third-Wave kind of place, but the drip is good and they also make a strange New Orleans-style drink with Chicory.  They have beers, kombucha, teas, etc.  Pizzas are sustainably sourced from some local pizza spot and they have plenty of snacks as well.  The back room is generally very quiet and has loads of tables and chairs.  During big test-taking-seasons (May and December), the place can be pretty packed, but still a good noise level.  Nobody cares if you stay there all day - the employees won't give you bad looks and the people around you are likely doing the same thing.  I've spent 12 hours straight here and, besides feeling like I was going to die from hatred of my project, I was glad I had a place like this.  The front room is more friendly to a few people sitting around and talking and the outdoor areas are obviously open to as much talking and beers as you want.    Power outlets a plenty, with power strips nearby.  Wi-Fi is good - better than you'd expect for a place full of laptops.",1

In terms of open-late coffee houses in the campus area, Flightpath wins:  - large, comfy tables that you can take up all for yourself and not feel like a jerk for (lots of solo parties here so you don't feel too bad), but at the same time share  without feeling awkward if someone comes in and asks if they can sit across from you  - outlets everywhere, even outside  - inside has a large space divided by window panels, maybe I'm too trusting (in fact, yes this is probably it) but the transparency made me feel really comfortable leaving my laptop and using the restroom right around the corner (always the trust struggle when you go to work alone)  - note: very quiet, I don't know if i would go here for anything other than work  - they have good coffee on drip, and their cake slices are reasonably priced ($4 vs. $6+ you usually see)  Four stars because parking is insane, and you need to go during a less busy window to find a table/seat inside because while the seating is large and comfy, it is a smaller space compared to the other late night coffee houses (which is what makes it nice because it can never get too packed like the rest of them and they retain their quality seating), it will pack up real quick.",1

If you need a budget friendly mid day pick me while studying or working - they have lots of treats.  I never have an issue finding a place to sit and their WiFi is reliable. They have several couches and chairs & an outside patio - this place is also great for a friend date.

Coffee Shop 25,"I am sad to have to give this 1 star. I really like this cafe. However, today we had a terrible experience.   I came with a friend with a service dog (tagged as service animal)  Two separate staff told her she couldn't bring a dog in. She explained that it was a service animal. First staff wasn't comfortable but accepted it. The second staff came over and told us to leave or go out on the patio. When informed that it was a service dog, he loudly asked her what her disability was.    I pulled him aside and informed him that it's not a legal question to ask. He rolled his eyes. Then said well, customers see the dog and want to bring their dogs in.   I told him it's not cool to ask that. He said ""it's not cool to bring a dog in here""    After that we got the cold shoulder from the staff.

Coffee Shop 25,"I was visiting from San Francisco and popped into Flightpath while I was waiting for my biscuits up the block. Cold brew was on-point, staff was friendly, and there was so much space to sit and hang out.  I came not expecting much, but I left feeling lucky.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"Flightpath is awesome for studying!  I really like the chai latte and the pizza (they have margherita pizza which is awesome). They also have a ton of snack selections.  When I moved to Austin a year ago, I was trying to look for a great study place . I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad - a college with tons of coffee shops nearby and lots of students studying.  Flightpath has that type of culture, just a place where people are just trying to study but are also really chill.  I'm more productive here than I am anywhere else.  The baristas have really, really good taste in music.  Sometimes they play entire albums, which I appreciate especially when it's good. Sometimes they play a good mix of music.  They played modest mouse, which made me really happy!",1
Coffee Shop 25,"15 check-ins Tons quieter than Bennu, tries less than Epoch but is still just as cool, and pretty cozy with its warm, colored lighting and thick little retro tables. About time I wrote a review for Flightpath--it's about 30 seconds from my house, has some terrific italian sodas, and I spent a good couple of seconds admiring the paintings hanging on the ceiling and wondering if they would ever fall.  There wasn't anything that stood out too much that made it much more different from other coffeeshops, except maybe I felt like it was a former diner (thanks, retro furniture). The barista was very nice both times I've been here, as opposed to some chilly reviews that I've seen, and said thank you to me twice. Wow!!! Just kidding. I anticipate returning often.",1
Coffee Shop 25,"The coffee here isn't that great and the lighting is really poor. Also, it seemed like they don't clean the tables too often so it gets kind of dirty sometimes.  P.S. don't sit outside because so many birds fly in and out of there! Also, the outside is really really dirty/messy too",0
Coffee Shop 25,"This place will always be special to me. First ever beer in austin. It was June 19, 2005. Three days after graduating my local school. An acquaintance bought me a Woodchuck cider. Never tried the coffee, the decor has changed, and the neighborhood is way different. But no matter how much it changes I'll always remember Flight path. I need to return and try the other offerings.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"This place is one of Austin's best kept secrets, and my go-to place for high quality, fresh roasted coffee beans at a reasonable price. The staff is super friendly and passionate about coffee while being entirely unpretentious. Although you can buy the beans at Central Market, they are fresher (and cheaper) straight from the roastery. And you can ask them about their favorites roasted earlier in the week!  By the way, this is not a counter service coffee shop, but a roastery that sells coffee beans. Make sure you grab a free sample behind the bar!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Such a cool place. I love that we got to go behind the bar and make up cups of coffee just like we were family or friends. I got the milk out of the fridge and the hanging chipped coffee cup off the wall. It just made it feel so inviting. They have the roasting going on out in the open so you can see what's up, smell beans and talk coffee with the other coffee nerds. We grabbed a couple of bags to bring home. Both smelled really unique and I am dying to put them in my mouth :) The coffee we tried when we were there was the Nicaragua. It was bright without being overly acidic and tasted like something you would want to drink with a good book and a cat in your lap. Think comfort food coffee. We will be back next time we are in town for sure. Roasting",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Totally love the concept and the coffee! We had a meeting close by and my girlfriend brought me in here as I said I needed another injection of caffeine. Walked in and saw a great coffee machine and syrups in a coffee bar style design on the right but no Baristas.  Left hand side I saw people behind the counter working and having fun. Pounds of coffee in bags and the hustle and bustle that caffeine gives me.  My girlfriend went behind the counter and i was so confused cause I didn't think we were allowed. She poured me some coffee and I loved it. We started talking to the people there and I noticed there was a yelp check in offer to buy some coffee. So I did! Columbian and a lighter roast that the guy said I can continue to drink all day long:)  They don't sell the cups of coffee...this is a roaster and wholesale or just distributor in reality. They sell their coffee to other places in Austin. Coffee was great, people were great, I loved the concept and if I'm in the neighborhood...I will always stop on for my free cup of coffee (leave a tip or buy a pound!)  Thanks Joe and everyone else who took time to tell us about Third Coast Coffee Fix yourself a sampling of some amazing coffee",1
Coffee Shop 70,"This local business is an absolute gem! Looooove their fresh-roasted beans! Also, everyone I've ever talked to from Third Coast has been incredibly friendly and helpful. I'm consistently impressed at the high quality, genuine customer service they provide!  My husband and I love their new Coyona Natural. It's a lighter medium roast that has a really unique flavor that I've never found anywhere else. It's a must-try for coffee nerds and anyone who wants to have a super yum cuppa jo.  I also love their Colombia roast which is great hot (pour-over is my preferred hot brewing method), or you can make a kick a&* cold brew with it!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Came here to buy a pound of coffee for my husband. Asked for a recommendation for french press and they were friendly and knowledgeable. They ground the coffee for me there, which was greatly appreciated. Very affordable ($9.50) compared to buying it at Central Market ($19).  Thanks, Third Coast!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"2 check-ins After spending the night at McKinney falls state park we headed out to find a good coffee shop. After getting to third coast coffee roasters we realized they are more of a roaster than a sit down ""coffee shop."" We bought a bag of beans and they had fresh brewed coffee for free! The guy who rang us up even gave us a tour of the place, showing us all the ins and outs, it was awesome!! A great place to buy beans (you get a full 16 oz bag for $9!!) and sip on a delicious cup of joe. Super friendly people there, with top notch beans. Definitely check it out, but don't expect a typical ""coffee house"" sit down.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"talk about smell pollution, the smell makes me nautilus..... reported to city for code view",0
Coffee Shop 70,"Came down from Houston and saw the place was really highly rated. We just started brewing or own coffee with the Aeropress, stopped in for some beans. The guy who spoke with us was VERY knowledgeable about coffee, but also didn't have an air of being snobby or better than whenever he was explaining stuff to us. Got an $8 pound, tipped him $5 for being such a badass.",1
Coffee Shop 70,Have spent the year during my travels searching for a great everyday espresso bean and found it in my own backyard here at Third Coast.  Great and caring customer service at the shop as well. Thanks Luis!,1
Coffee Shop 70,Sipping on some El Guapo (Did they name this after me??) as I type this review.  I used to be a backyard coffee roaster until I found Third Coast.  I've been hitting this place up for about two years now and they never disappoint.  The guys there even entertain my inner coffee geek!  My La San Marco espresso machine loves Third Coast!,1
Coffee Shop 70,"My coffee addiction is satisfied with Third Coast.  I've tried various types of coffee beans and I'm a lover of many but my all time favorite is the Sumatra. Best coffee in Texas, possibly nation!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"This place is awesome. Good people and tasty coffee for just $9/lb. I was looking for honey processed coffee after a friend was raving about it and Third Coast Coffee definitely didn't disappoint. Go support your local coffee roaster, grab a free sample and take a tour.",1
Coffee Shop 70,Friendly and knowledgeable staff plus $9 per 1lb bag coffees of many varietals. Too bad we couldn't take more home to SF!,1
Coffee Shop 70,"DELICIOUS COFFEE.  This isn't a coffee shop, it's a roastery. In other words, don't go expecting to sit down and have a cup of joe or work. However, if you want to buy some delicious freshly roasted local coffee, then this is your place!!  Light roast recommendation: Coyona Natural Medium roast recommendation: Moka Java Dark roast recommendation: Double French will blow your mind.  For bulletproof style: I used Moka Java to make some butter and honey coffee this morning. It. Is. Awesome.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"This place is great.  Friendly staff, excellent selection, almost half the price as stores.  Grabbed a bag of Mixtlan ( Mexican Fence Roast ), a bag of Honey Processed Honduras, and a thing of Cold Brew Concentrate.  It's hard to for 26 dollars.  I know for a fact my nearby specialty market sells their stuff for 15.99 a pound.",1
Coffee Shop 70,My husband and I love coffee and I was thrilled to find Third Coast Coffee.  Their coffee beans are really good and their customer service is amazing.  Their prices are also very reasonable for the quality of coffee you get.  Thank you Third Coast!,1
Coffee Shop 70,3 check-ins Excellent roasters in South Austin.  Super good prices.   Convenient.   Check in on yelp and save a buck on a lb..  That's 8$ for fresh locally roasted high quality coffee..try one of their natural wash coffees.  I like the Ethiopian sidamo,1
Coffee Shop 70,Amazing coffee roasters. Creating delicious coffee roasts at an affordable price. I usually buy 6lbs when visiting as there isn't anything this good that i can afford in SF.  Love the coffee and the customer service.,1
Coffee Shop 70,Double French is dope! Great price for coffee like this. Keep up the good work.  (Coffee haiku review),1
Coffee Shop 70,"I will tell u what..... The reviews here are not lying! Very helpful and knowledgable helped me out when I was there. I am kinda a snob when it comes to coffee. I usually drink Kona from those way overpriced websites. 45$ a pound. Well, after seeing all the great reviews on third coast , I could not resist. Joe, the guy who helped me, steered me in the right direction as far as what I would like with my tastes. I finally tried it this am.... WOW I will never buy coffee from anyone else. VERY SMOOTH!!! It was one of their best sellers. The Ethiopian Sumatra I think. I am sooo ok with paying 9 $ per pound vs 45! I WILL BE BACK. Also, u can buy it in 5 gallon buckets which is what I plan to do!!!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I love Third Coast. They're the best neighbor, ever. The coffee is superb, the employees are incredibly helpful and bean-nerdy, and the price is right, especially if you take the extra time to buy direct from the roasterie. They have a coffee bar area right when you walk in, and usually have a free coffee brewed to try while you're buying.  Just so you know: No, they are not a coffee shop, they are a local roasterie and only do distribution of ground and bean coffee by the pound to other businesses, or individuals that stop by/order.  I love dark roasts, and the Double French is amazing. You rock, Third Coast!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I haven't been to the storefront, but I love their beans!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Their in-store price is much more affordable than what Whole Foods, Central Market, or Fresh Plus charges. Double French Roast is amazing, this is really good quality with tons of flavor! My hubby drinks it every morning.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"TO MY HOUSTON PEEPS:  I just drank some of the best coffee I've ever had!  I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means, but I do like good coffee.  I usually stick to basic medium-roast blends, and not a fan of artificially flavored coffee.  I recently heard good things about  Austin's Third Coast Coffee, and you could get it at Whole Foods in Houston where I live.  I finally found it at the Alabama/Kirby location in 12 ounce packages.    Just by the look of the package, you could tell it was locally roasted and packaged.  When I picked up a package, you could smell the wonderful aroma of the coffee beans through the package...it smelled like heaven!  I looked on the bottom of the package and saw the coffee was roasted on July 23, 2013...and the date I was in Whole Foods was FOUR DAYS LATER...Saturday, July 27!!  No wonder it smelled so fresh!  I ended up purchasing the Columbia roast.  On the package you will find a description of the specific coffee roast, the batch lot number and the actual farm in Columbia where it was grown.  You can even trace your coffee on the Third Coast website.  I only drink coffee in the morning, so I couldn't wait until the next morning (Sunday) to try it.  Wow.  This had to be the smoothest-tasting, well-balanced coffee I ever had!  It was a true medium roast with a slight caramel, buttery taste that lingered on your taste buds after you drank it.  And I don't have a fancy-schmancy ultra-expensive or exotic coffee maker or grinder.  I have a ten year-old Krups ProAroma coffee maker, and a $20 Krups grinder.  When using freshly ground coffee beans, I do use Melitta #4 super premium natural brown cone filters (instead of the Krups gold filter) that doesn't leave sediment at the bottom of the pot.  The 12-ounce bag at Whole Foods sold for $12.49.  But when you consider it was just roasted four days earlier (in Austin) and how wonderful it tasted, it was well worth it!  I can't wait to try some of the other varieties!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"9 check-ins Unroasted green coffee beans at $5.50/lb. Roasted beans at $9/lb.  The guy asked me what kind of coffee I like. I said: Funky, earthy, leathery, aged, monsooned. He then recommended the Ethiopian Sidamo dry-processed, which I grabbed 2 unroasted pounds of for a great price. They had some of it brewed up - it smelled and tasted like goat cheese - how's that for funky?! I love it. I also bought a half-pound of the roasted wet-processed Sidamo, which wasn't funky but had very bright notes, like eating ripe fruit - great stuff.  While they don't have a huge selection, what they do have is top notch. It's worth a visit here to get the beans at a good discount.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"The new double French roast is my favorite. Previously it was the Italian roast. The flavor of the double French is amazing, the spices and earthy undertones are so clear, yummy!  I enjoy all the coffee Third Coast Coffee produces! Double French Press Roast is amazing!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Love Third Coast! Be aware this isn't a coffee SHOP, but it's pretty much the only place I go to buy whole bean coffee in Austin.  Really friendly people, and they have a great selection of beans. Everything is roasted fresh. So fresh, that I usually have to wait a day or two to start brewing!  Can't be beat, especially for only $9 a pound!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Amazing coffee fresh roasted on site. The place smells soooo good when you walk in. It's not a coffee bar, like some may expect.They are working roasting beans, so that's probably why they seem occupied and not waiting for someone to come in and order coffee. Although you can. It's a wholesale roaster, but if you take the time to pop in, you can get top quality whole bean coffee at a great price, right from the source. I'm a fan!",1
Coffee Shop 70,Love this place. Okay its not a Starbucks or a place to sit and chat with friends after ordering a fancy drink. Just great quality coffee for tasting and buying. I don't understand the bad customer service reviews posted here on Yelp. I had the exact opposite experience. Employee greeted me and asked if I needed help. He listened to my preferences and recommended a great coffee at a fantastic price. I even received a free cup of phenomenal coffee. It does not get any better than this.,1
Coffee Shop 70,"Third Coast Coffee is the best!  A friend from work (Thanks Judy) turned me on to Third Coast.  Finished the gift pound, then went to their South Congress location for more.  It's addictive.  They didn't have the coffee that I wanted available there, but there were plenty more to choose from.  I bought a pound of Italian Roast, and a pound of Mexico beans.  We were looking for something I would like, and they let me smell the Mexico beans.  I stuck my head in the bucket (if that paints a weird picture, it was really over the bucket, not deep inside), and didn't want to take it out.  It was a smell directly from heaven.  Needless to say, both the Italian and Mexico beans are being thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated.  I recommend going by their store.  Great people, great buckets.  Their coffee is unbelievable.",1
Coffee Shop 70,We waited for about five minutes. Greeted by a few employees waking about the store. No one asked us if we wanted a drink. Poor customer service. Felt like I was intruding on their space. Do not recommend I you want good customer service.,0
Coffee Shop 70,"I've been drinking coffee since I was 8 (it's okay, I'm South American).  I like a nice dark roast and I drink it black.  One problem that you can encounter is bitterness when you drink your coffee in this fashion.  When I met Linda who had a stand set up at Fresh Plus, that was how she got me.  ""Our dark roast is not bitter.""  She's right.  It's not.  I sampled and purchased the Italian Dark Roast and I'm a happy woman.  I have a coffee maker that has the grinder built in and every time I pass through the kitchen to the back of the house I will stop dead in my tracks as the scent of the beans reach my nose.  It's so arresting.  I've actually forgotten why I was headed to the other part of the house thanks to the beans.  I need to stop by one day and check out the facility as I would love to see it.  Meanwhile you can buy it at Fresh Plus and also online.  I'm sure they are in other stores too, but this is what I know.  Happy coffee drinking. ;)",1
Coffee Shop 70,"These guys are boss. No, they're rad. Everything about this place convinces you of your (my) highschool belief that you can relax and work hard at the same time...and that work can be a place you'd want to hang out. The coffee selection is wonderful, and these folks appreciate it like fine wine or microbrew. They will send you home with a sample of anything, they'll pull you an esspresso while they chat you up and though everyone here is ""over caffinated"", no one is out-of-their-minds-talkie to make you run away in horror.   This is not a coffee shop, its a coffee buisiness with way less 'tude than most coffee shops. They also sell wonderful gifts in the form of beautiful, handmad coffee mugs (i now own 3) and accesseries. All this AND fairtrade, organic, and delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"There are some businesses with people so honest and committed, with business practices so sincere, and with products beyond compare, that you feel compelled to share such gems with others.  Third Coast Coffee is a shining example.    From their modest storefront, you'd hardly expect to leave with cherished black gold in a cup, but that's precisely what you'll get.  You may also come away with an thoughtful discussion, and make a friend or two, but that's just part of the total experience that Third Coast has to offer.   They even gave my 6 year old son a lesson in coffee roasting on one visit, which not remotely the type of education you'll earn at your local Starbucks.  I luxuriated in several of their outstanding coffees before landing on the El Salvador, which is an intoxicatingly deep and satin-smooth brew that sits on an entirely distinct, divine plane from other beans.  No matter how challenging my day may look in the morning, just the thought of this coffee (freshly ground and paired with my Aeropress) is enough to put a spring in my step and throw a sanguine outlook on my day.  If this all sounds like too much, then you probably just haven't had the chance for such an experience yet through Third Coast.  I hope you do.  UPDATE 1/2/13:  I'm a scientist, so I love to experiment.  I had read raves about super high-end ""Bulletproof"" Coffee, which seems to be almost universally lauded.  Stuff costs $23 for 0.75 lb (with shipping).  So I tried it ( using my Aeropress, of course).  It was good, yes.  But the El Salvador totally BURIES it....at $9/lb.  As an aside, I noticed that the guy that hawks Bulletproof coffee also recommends Third Coast ""site unseen"":  bulletproofexec.com/3-st…",1
Coffee Shop 70,"love their coffee and the shop...it's not a coffee shop though! Didn't know all about fair trade until i discovered this place...Makes me feel even better every time sip my coffee knowing that they pay off good to the farmers, it's organic and fresh! roasted right in the store!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I love Third Coast Colombian Coffee!  I initially discovered it while having breakfast at Kirby Lane.  I have been buying the beans in bulk and this has completely broken my Starbucks addiction.  Thank goodness, because I had been burning a hole in my wallet on a weekly basis!  This stuff is amazing.  Third Coast knows coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"If you enjoy good coffee (not the stuff that comes in a ""stay fresh"" can) You must buy your coffee from here! Not only do they give back to the farmers that grow the beans, they are a local roaster so the coffee is fresh when you get it. Not to mention it tastes wonderful.  If you are crafty, they also have coffee sacks to take home! We made a pillow with one",1
Coffee Shop 70,"For those who love to brew at home, this is your spot. Great local roasts and friendly employees. They also sell a (limited) amount of brewing supplies there, and I noticed they sold a variety of Monin syrups, which put them over the top for me.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I'll never buy beans anywhere else again.  I was a dutiful Starbucks drinker (I know, I know), until I read about things like single-origin coffees, and how the health of the bean makes a huge difference. And while I'm lucky enough to live in Austin, I'm north enough to where I order my beans and have them shipped to me.  They're absolutely magnificent. The beans are fantastic, I got my order in two days, and every detail down to the bags is just perfect.  And, the wildest thing: when they say ""laden with sweet fig, plum, and smooth chocolate flavors"", that's not hyperbole: you can smell and taste those flavors like nothing else. Third Coast is turning me into a coffee snob, I just know it.  Update: well, it has been a few years since I wrote that review... and I'm just about to put in another order. I'm a diehard fan, and happy as can be.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"The guy working was really nice and helpful when I came in the other day -- he asked me what kinds of roasts I like, and helped me choose a few of their roasts that would be similar.  He let me smell a bunch of their different roasts to help me decide, and he was also very helpful about explaining how their business works.  They primarily sell wholesale, but if you find a particular roast of theirs that you love you can call in advance and they'll set aside enough for you so it'll be there when you come in.  Also, maybe it's just more sticker shock for me, but coffee here is really inexpensive!  The highest quality at the lowest price?  Count me in.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"After the demise of Little City, I was worried I'd never find another local coffee roaster to call home. Anderson's is okay, uses cheap bags and relies too heavily on their neighborhood clientele. Other coffee roasters in town seem more like a business designed to turn a profit than a small company producing a quality hand-crafted product.    Two years ago, I was relieved to find exactly what I was looking for in a local coffee roaster - fair or direct trade beans, roasted according to the bean (not the roast), fair prices (they're actually cheap!) and someone at the counter that knows your face. I french press every morning and get excited when I have a fresh bag from Third Coast. I can't speak to the flavor note descriptions, but I know good coffee when I taste it and know my preferences. I skew towards Central/South American beans. I've bought their Guatemalan beans (try the new one!) more than most. The Mexican is light, bright and perfect for mornings - Kerbey Lane uses it. The Peruvian is delicious - they use it in the Briggo automated coffee machine at UT, where I work. When they have it in stock, the Nicaraguan is wonderful.  I recently moved from 78704 to Hyde Park and can't make it to their humble store front on South Congress now :( It smells incredible inside! They always have a carafe of fresh coffee and paper cups for customers to take sample on the road with them. Thankfully, I can order online and pickup at the Hope Farmer's Market on Sundays. I'm currently enjoying their ""Special Purpose"" blend.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"TCCRC. That is one mean acronym for a rather simple name. Third Coast Coffee just sounds a little sleeker. I mean, I can't even begin to comprehend where that term comes from or, much less, how to discern what it is referencing.  So, let's get down to business. This local roaster (you can buy the goods at the SoCo shop) cranks out a hodgepodge of caffeinated offerings. They roast all different styles and origins, but the hands-down winner is the Mexico.  The Mexico is rich, smooth, and, though it provides no hint of bitterness, provides a great kick alongside the rather sweet chocolate notes.  Yes, many coffee roasters now are ""fair-trade"" etc. and supportive of the environment and humanitarian in their efforts, but few offer the cool little ""lot"" feature as this fine institution does on their website. You can see why they claim to be very ""cooperative"" in production, sourcing, and pushing (hehe, I like using the term ""pushing"" now, with all the deal-busts and what not).",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Third Coast has ruined cheap coffee for me forever.  In years past, before kids and mortgages I bought good coffee.  However, the last few years expensive coffee was a luxury that wasn't in the mix.  Thankfully, Third Coast provides not only great coffee but fair prices as well.  I purchased a Living Social deal and came in to redeem the offer.  We picked up a pound of El Salvador and Double French.  I am not a coffee expert by any means so these varieties were both suggestions of the employees.  Both are great, but as I only have a basic drip coffee maker I think I prefer the El Salvador.  I don't know how much more I can say for their coffee, it is incredible.  Go try some samples and give them your business.  Quick tip: check in on Yelp for a discounted pound of coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Best coffee I've found in Austin yet. Great price if you buy it from them directly. Really friendly and helpful employees. I like to go in and ask for a recommendation.

Coffee Shop 70,Third Coast Coffee sells spectacularly wonderful organic coffee sourced directly from coops that they visit regularly. It's only $9/lb if you stop by their location on S. Congress. I've bought coffee from them for years and never been disappointed. So yummy!,1

Coffee Shop 70,"I created a Yelp account specifically to comment on Third Coast.  I dropped by earlier today, after some Googling, just looking for a new place to buy java.  I don't know all that much about coffee.  I only know what I've narrowed down so far in my (limited) experience- I like higher altitude, water-processed coffee, and that's about it all I know.  I really dislike over-roasted beans (ahem, superchain coffee empire).  I like something with lower acidity that I can drink a lot of.    I can't hang in most conversations with people who know every little detail about coffee, wine, tabacco, all the finer things, yada yada.  I can't tell if I taste hints of leather and giraffe essence.  I just try stuff, and stick with what I think is good.  Well, these guys are experts in every little detail and more, but were not at any point snooty or condescending.  They were very friendly, open, and laid back.  They recommended their Peru based on what I said I liked (which, btw, was just roasted yesterday), talked a bit about their ""from the ground up"" Fair Trade business model, and the owner had just gotten back from a trip down South (America) to tour and spend time with a lot of the co-ops from whom they import.  Their hands are physically in every aspect of the business.  It was all very impressive,  but...  It was not NEARLY as impressive as when I got home, ground up that Peru, and had a (few) cups.  HOLY SCHNEIKIES.  Probably about the best cup of coffee I've ever had.  Seriously.  That might speak to my newb-ness, but it was really that good.  Light but still very flavorful, and I could probably drink about a gallon of it if I didn't think my heart was going to explode.  Just so fresh and delicious.  I'm going to annoy the crap out of all of my friends and family about this place, until they've all dropped by and bought coffee.  They will thank me.  I can't wait to try different varieties!",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I got a Groupon for Strange Brew that included half a pound of coffee beans.  I'd never been there before, so I headed on down and collected my prize.  It was half a pound of Third Coast's Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and holy crap is it good.  All the way home I could smell the coffee sitting in my passenger seat, filling my car with delicious, spicy, amazing goodness.  If it had not been 1am on a weeknight, I think I'd have brewed a pot then and there, just based on the smell.  I could not bring myself to put this coffee in my grinder without cleaning out the previous batch of beans.  I ground up what I THOUGHT was two or three days' worth of coffee to take to work.  I will be grinding more tonight to bring tomorrow.  Today I've had twice as much coffee as even my sleepiest day.  I can't stop sticking my nose in my coffeecup, and then the coffee is RIGHT THERE so I have to have a little sip, and then I'm out of coffee so I have to fill my cup again, and the cycle continues.  When I die, if I have lived a very good life, I expect to find this coffee waiting for me.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I've never visited the store. However, I got hooked on their coffee several years ago when they sold it in bulk via Central Market up in Dallas. I now mail order directly from their web site.  Third Coast has really excellent coffee. I keep Double French Roast on hand at my house at all times. Dark, tart, and smart. :-)",1
Coffee Shop 70,I am so excited to discover this place! The price is right and very convenient to order online and go pick up if you live on the south side. Have really enjoyed the varieties I have gotten so far.,1
Coffee Shop 70,"This place is the mosquito's tuxedo!  I came here looking for a good medium roast Sumatran and now I come back for whatever they have freshly roasted.  I've learned a lot about coffee beans, coffee farmers, coffee makers and the ""weirdos"" (i mean that nicely :) ) who work in the coffee business.  If they have the espresso machine turned on when you're there (which is rare, I think) ask them for a Miami Vice or a Chocolate Rain -- they've come up with some weird but very tasty drinks there.  I heard their roaster's been roasting coffee here for 16 or 17 years, but I just heard of them from a friend a few months ago.  This place is wicked, dope and fresh (as my friend Melissa would say...)  Drink up!  My favorite is the Ethiopia Yirgacheff but I've liked everything I've tried here.  Oh, organic, fair trade, farmer friendly, etc. etc. etc.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"Seriously amazing coffee and awesome staff, couldn't ask for more. I love that you can look up info on the coffee purchased with the given lot #. The price to quality ratio here is definitely high, coffee snobs please come hither",1
Coffee Shop 70,Updated review YEP still the best coffee in Texas and they sell it wholesale at the roasting shop on Congress.,1
Coffee Shop 70,"this review was based on Linda's stewardship.  unknown now.  Best Coffee you can buy!   Locally owned and roasted; Internationally savvy, organic and Fair Trade. What more do you need to know?    : )  Look for tastings at the store.",1
Coffee Shop 70,"I found Third Coast thanks to a coupon from Home Run.  I'm enjoying a cup of Colombian as I write this and it is fabulous.  It's so much fuller in flavor than other coffee.  Also, if you like the coffee at Kerbey Lane, you can buy their blend at Third Coast.  The staff at Third Coast were very friendly and knew their coffee.  As has been said in other reviews, just tell then what you like and they will recommend a coffee you will love.  So go by their South Congress location if you can or visit them on line.  You'll feel good about buying Fair Trade coffee and you'll love the coffee you get.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu Coffee serves up some delicious coffee and pastries, as well as having plenty of study/sitting space for the social and college studying life! Iced coffee is always my favorite, and this place does it right (better than Starbucks for sure).  I like how this place is relatively close to campus (even though I live in West Campus), and it's  24/7 (for all you night owl's out there...). The atmosphere is nice and homey, which helps to create a calm atmosphere for studying and socializing.  Now, I know a main concern about places like these is a lovely necessity called ""power plugs"". I can definitely say that there is plenty to go around to plug in all your electronic needs. They have cords you can pull from the ceiling, in the walls, extension cords and other accessible power plugs overall. So, you never have to worry about not having enough for your friends and family",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Heard a lot about Bennu and was told this was the place to go on my hunt for good coffee in Austin.  Went in mid afternoon on a Saturday.  Short line but most of the tables were full.  While I waited heard the barista making some snide remarks about people and their coffee order, attitude, etc.  Almost turned around and left.  I 100% get dealing with the public sucks and am all for good humor, sarcasm, and wit.  Might be saying she went a little too far..  Finally my turn and was a bit apprehensive that I would say/do something to turn the wrath on me.    Ordered the Iced Bennu which was worth every sugary calorie in it.  Also ordered a piece of banana bread which was great.  Found a place to sit and watched the show as people.  Great coffee.  Great atmosphere.  Will I be back?  Pretty sure the answer is yes.  Will just mind my P's and Q's if I do so that I don't get called out.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I've had The Raven iced and hot. Prefer Iced for that one, get a bit more for your money.  Their traditional chais are delicious! Ambiance is quiet, laid back. Great study place. Gluten free options limited, but lemon poppy seed cake is great!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"We had an early drive and so came to this coffee shop since it was one of the few places that were open at 6am. I had an americano while my friends had the milk-based coffees. We all thought that the coffee tasted weak. Guess it's a good place to be at if you need coffee at an odd hour, or just looking for a place to chill with WiFi. Otherwise, you're better off getting a cuppa elsewhere. 6.15am coffee run",0
Coffee Shop 5,"3 check-ins THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! First of all, they are open 24/7. That's a plus when it comes to finals.  Second, they have affordable coffee that taste so good! I love how their mocha drinks are named after popular books. For example, Pride and Prejudice, Moby Dick, Scarlet Letter. Even just their regular house brewed coffee taste great! My top two drinks I order is the regular hot latte and regular ice coffee with hazel nut syrup!  Third, the interior design and atmosphere is perfect for a chill hangout, casual date or just to go study. There are a bunch of tables and seats. However, every time I got there it's always packed so you kind of have to fight for your seat. If you smoke or just love nature they have outdoor seatings too with cute lights hanging outside.  Overall I love this place and definitely recommend! ACAI smoothie! Peach, Pear, Apricot Smoothie $4.60 See all photos from Sara C. for Bennu Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 5,Very rude people that work here. I came in from Portland Oregon and was excited to try the place out. Very disappointed in how they treated me and my friends.,0
Coffee Shop 5,"Fairly nice sized coffee shop in east austin.  This is my 2nd ever coffee shop to visit here, but the best thus far.  The interior is pretty welcoming and has many tables, chairs and couches to choose from.  Electrical drop cords hang from the ceiling so you don't have to sit along the walls to power your devices.  I chose the iced coconut mocha raven and a cinnamon roll to snack on while I was waiting for the Franklin's line to shorten.  This was a perfect start to the day.  I'd come back again if I was ever in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Love this place. Great place to get work done, a lot of outlets to work with, coffee is good. Customer service is fantastic as well.  Only knock on it is that the internet can run really slow! I mean it can be slow to the point that checking an email can take up to 5-10 minutes. Cough up an extra $100/month to get that speed up!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Atmosphere: 5 stars with plenty of outlets hanging from the ceiling Blue Hawaiian iced tea: 5 stars Cookie: 1 star (dry and flavorless-- double chocolate chocolate chip) Friendliness: 5 for the male cashier and barista, 1 for the blond female barista (rude when announcing drinks and taking orders).  Nice location for meeting people and plenty of seats (though packed the entire time we were there). Not my first choice but also Not a bad one. Dry cookie",1
Coffee Shop 5,"So this place is on MLK across from united way building. Which is where I was headed but needed a caff pick up. So I stopped here. First impression, which door so I go in. I'm In and wow this place is well decorated from first glance. Someone took time in this. Then I get to the counter and ask, what's good. I gave a suggestion, she suggested as well and we met in the middle. I paid. Wait, I didn't even say what size I wanted. Confused. 60 seconds later I have my Bennu ice coffee. Mostly ice but no worries, it's hot out. I go get a straw and lid placed neatly in an armoire. Then I look for a seat as a lady ask who's cell phone is this. So the ppl here are honest. The music I must say is very calming and pro 90's. Love it. Kinda slow and sad tho but I like it. They have this coin vault atm, no ide whyyyyyy! I find a seat and notice not one chair or table matches. Hah Then my seat literally has an extension cord hanging behind my head. What the heck, lol. Then I notice the menu painted on a mirror. This place is getting weird. I quickly sip my drink, yum and head out. Glad I stopped. Where the majic is made",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Came here for the first time and really enjoyed my visit! The parking lot was completely full, but I managed to find parking along the small road adjacent to the coffee shop (parallel but not metered parking!)  Bennu has both outside and inside seating, and when I visited (around 4pm), there were a lot of people. I really like that there is a big seating area with all types of chair-table placements. even with all of the people already there, I was able to easily find a place to sit.  Two things that I like about Bennu is that there are plenty of outlets and music without lyrics. The lighting is pretty dim, but areas next to Windows should bear enough light for those who prefer brighter areas.    Their iced mochas were delicious but slightly expensive in my opinion ($4+). I tried The Raven and Oliver Twist mochas, which were both so good! I also tried their cheese Danish, which was not that fresh, but I'm assuming it was because we came in middle of the day. Although not warm and fresh, I was satisfied. It was a good snack, especially paired with the ice mocha.  I was really relaxed and had a great time here, I'll definitely be back for more drinks and perhaps to study!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"There's only so much work you can get done at home when you share an ""office"" with a furry, cuddly distraction. Sometimes you have to get away and cut the proverbial leash. With Bennu in my corner (and around the corner) I have a full-time office away from home, but still close to home.  The 24/7 aspect of Bennu lures in the tired grad students and undergrads of the UT campus nearby, but since there is tons of seating and plenty of indoor and outdoor space, it never feels too crowded. This place is not for the uptight, minimalistic, or claustrophobic, because the interior is decorated in Austin-chic. Cluttered, dark, vintage and charming.  They have good coffee, too. I always get the house, but they also have a dark roast. Coffee isn't the only thing they serve up though, they also sell pizza from Hoboken, Bagels, sandwiches, and tacos in the morning. Once they even created a Topo Chico mocktail as an ode to the late, Prince.  Whether you work from home, or have to do homework, Bennu is the right place to go. Grab an office chair, a cup of coffee, and werk, werk, werk, werk, werk.  P.S - to the barista who plays 90s country music, I enjoy every minute up until one of your coworkers inevitably shuts it off!",1
Coffee Shop 5,This place is definitely my favorite coffee shop so far! Everything I've had here has been delicious and the service is outstanding! The seating is comfortable and the atmosphere nice. I have no complaints whatsoever. The Pride and Prejudice and Italian pasta salad was so good The Moby Dick was delicious!,1
Coffee Shop 5,The scarlet letter is my fav! Chocolate and chili powder...mmmmmm  Great selection of local (de)caffeinated teas for non-coffee drinkers.  We love to come here to study,1
Coffee Shop 5,"When I think of Bennu, I imagine the hipster best friend of your sister who is utterly reliable but a tad zany. She is utterly reliable for advice 24/7 as are the hours of this coffee shop, but wonderfully random and chaotic, which is the decorations and furnishings.  Bennu has ample space with numerous tables and a multitude of outlets, hanging from the ceiling and coming out of the walls. The lighting can be dark if you are not seated directly beneath one of the dim light fixtures.  Coffee is moderately priced with numerous offerings. The french press is a great deal if you order the larger pot and drink it insidiously throughout your long hours of studying. The iced bennu is one of my favorites. It has a great hazelnut flavor and is pretty sweet. I love that they use pulverized mini ice instead of large blocks in their iced coffee. Just adds something to the experience. The latte is pretty typical and safe to order if you are unsure. If you are trying to save, order the affordable americano.  They also offer a variety of sweets and pastries catered by different restaurants. The carrot cake is very decadent and quite tasty.  Parking can stink if you don't arrive in time to nab one of the front offerings. However there are many roadsides you can choose from to test out your parallel skills.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Q: Uhhhh, how much could I love this place? A: Enough that half of Austin does, too. It's 8:30PM, and this place almost looks like a night club on Saturday. Except there is room to navigate between seats and tables.  1. Famous for $4-5 mochas. Get one. I'm crying that I can't finish the other half, but I'll never be able to sleep if I do :'( (trashy first world problem.) 2. Street parking abundant. 3. Tons of communal work spaces, work counters, and individual squashy seats. 4. 24/7 for all of your late night study needs.  Low key and perfect for the Austin repertoire.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Quirky and cool coffee shop! (Think mismatched tables and chairs. And cord extensions hanging from the ceiling.) We tried the Bennu iced coffee on a whim, and let me tell ya, it was so good! It's a sweet pecan-flavored iced coffee. (You can't distinctly taste pecans though.. It's similar to hazelnut iced coffee.) I like how they use ""soft ice"" instead of normal ice cubes, and the small size was at least a Starbucks's grande.  I think it's awesome that they're opened 24/7; I'm envious and hope coffee shops in Dallas do the same! Extra plus: The infamous ""You're my butter half"" wall art sign is just across the street!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Loved the atmosphere. I ordered the pride and prejudice, iced mocha and it was really tasty. My hubs ordered straight black coffee on ice and he liked his too. Next time were in the area. We'll have to stop by again.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Without hesitation, I have no problem driving from San Antonio to Austin just to study at Bennu Coffee...that is how much I love this coffee shop.    The idea that this coffee shop is open 24 hours massively appeals to me.  I have an abnormal sleep schedule, and having a coffee shop accessible when I want it is amazing to me.  Two downsides: parking and seating.  These two things are the reasons why they didn't get five stars from me.  Parking is very limited and the entrance is steep, causing me to always scratch the bottom of my bumper.  If you go during peak hours, there will be zero seats.   Other than these two items, their prices for their drinks and food are cheap.    If there is one thing that will make San Antonio better, a 24/7 coffee shop is a MUST.  I can't wait until I visit Bennu again.",1
Coffee Shop 5,Updated review 2 check-ins Listed in Give me coffee or give me death! Really? I gave a bad review. That was a long time ago. All is forgiven as time passes by. Everything is all well. Coffee and food is great. The fact you are open 24 hours is a plus.,1
Coffee Shop 5,"I'll keep it short- not so sweet. Just about any coffee shop that is open 24/7 has only the one perk. - convenience. Props for having local Vegan treats aka junk food. Ain't mad at cha. I'm starting to question whether the first place I should scope out are the bathrooms- then decide If I consume a product from the establishment. Firstly- my own personal jackazzery option- any coffee shop that only has ""syrups"" to add flavor to your brew- a total waste of time. And basically tells you their commitment to (let's go with an overly exaggerated)- ""excellence"" Mind you- I'd not still be sitting here keeping my dear friend company had I first thought, "" go check out the porta- john that's been sitting on the side of the road for days"" eeewwww. The extent to my visit. One house coffee. Which later had me stomach in a nightmarish uproar. sour on sour on revolting pain. Neva ever again. I think you need a penicillin shot- after just considering to walk in that door.  Cute mugs..I do like a place that uses all completely random- eclectic drink vessels.   They don't take a name. They simply call out what you ordered.  Release the hounds for everyone who ordered a... Amusing little signs around the place. I did not tap. I wouldn't want to disturb the parasitic pastries behind the protective layer of filth- you call glass.

Coffee Shop 5,"Funky place, but great coffee. When I was there it was super busy, but still served quickly. There was a great many people there, and despite all the seating, it was hard to find a place to sit. The price of popularity I guess! Will return for more though.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"4 check-ins This locally owned business is open 24/7- Best part. The flavor's are amazing. My favorite drink is their latte, the espresso is rich with some nice flavor as well.I love their coffee better than Starbucks!! They have maintained their quality unlike these big chain businesses.I usually stop by here in the mornings, on the way to my work to pick up my to-go.Any time of the day-night you drop in and they are busy.  The cafe also serves up some decent food fare(though i haven't tried any ever), they have a nice selection of flavors for your coffee or Tea and other cafe treats as well. The ambiance is very casual, very comfortable and Yes of course Free WiFi !! They have both inside and outside sitting and a great private parking lot.",1
Coffee Shop 5,16 oz coffee tasted good and was $2.16 with tax. Staff was friendly and I liked the ambiance in Bennu. Seems like a good place to study or read or even go with a small group.,1
Coffee Shop 5,"This place is a jewel! Very easy to concentrate and work here, or meet with friends, or have a private lesson. Very low key, great personnel, nice ambience. Coffee is not the best in town, but its decent, has got a great variety and all the rest of the advantages cover for it.",1
Coffee Shop 5,I love this place! The coffee is so yummy and I love their unique creations! I also love the chill atmosphere and the baristas.,1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu is great! It's a dark atmosphere with lots of electric outlets for students and freelancers. Mostly, though, I go because the baristas are super nice and create a friendly atmosphere.  This morning Ami was taking orders and knuckles was making them. Knuckles said, do you want full caffeine? Oh! I want decaf! I said. Ya, you don't drink much caffeine, so I thought I'd ask. Then I noticed that she anticipated the orders of everyone else in line.  The other barista that really seems to affect the tone of the place is charlie. And then there's the woman with the super cool glasses that told me to go to gene optical. ...just trying to spread the kudos... there is no bennu barista I don't like. Y'all are awesome!  litsa",1

Coffee Shop 5,"Listed in Wanderlust: Austin, Texas I'm a big fan of coffee and tea. We were in Austin for F1 and it just happened to fall on a weekend where we had hurricane like weather the entire time that we were there. Bennu Coffee was located across the street from a mural that I had wanted to see during our stay and we decided to get some drinks to keep warm in the cold. Bennu Coffee is one of the bigger cafes I've seen in a long time. It is outlets paradise making it an ideal place for students to get some work done. I had initially intended on ordering tea but once I saw that they had a specialty mocha menu named after famous pieces of literature, I had to order one of them.  We ordered the Pride and Prejudice (Blend of Sweet Chocolate Powder and Sauce topped with home-made whipped cream and dusted with chocolate powder) and a Sweet Chai Latte (sweet vs spicy). Now I'm not a fan of Chai and this was no exception. I found the chai flavor a bit too overwhelming. If this was their sweet version, I can't imagine how intense their spicy version is. To be fair, my boyfriend said he liked it and he's a pretty avid drinker of chai lattes.  I was really hoping to enjoy my mocha but it fell short for me as well. I could barely taste the coffee because of the overwhelming chocolate flavor. I understand that it was a mocha that I ordered but that shouldn't mean that you drown the coffee flavor out entirely. It was a bit of a disappointment for me since it cost me over $4 and I barely drank half of it.  The barista was very friendly and answered any questions we had about the drinks we ordered. I really wanted to love this cafe because I'm all about supporting local businesses but their coffee just didn't do it for me. Think I'll pass! 2/5",0
Coffee Shop 5,"3 check-ins Great study spot and so so soooo close to campus! Super convenient parking and a pretty desolate area, so traffic isn't bad and getting out to turn left (where you have to cross the right lane first) is super easy and not at all scary! Also conveniently located across the ""your my butter half"" famous Austin mural for all those insta-worthy pics! One of the few rare gems that opens 24/7 for all those late night owls and last minute exam crams such as myself haha, but it does get busy actually and seating may be hard to find towards midnight and beyond! But... What a great way to meet new people when you ask someone if you could share the table with them! I haven't tried the specialty drinks yet, but coffee is pretty good and the Mexican hot chocolate is TO DIE FOR! Idk how the Mexicans do it, but their hot chocolate is another WOWOOWOW in a long list of delicious Mexican treats!! Overall, a lil dim but chill and viben study spot for all those late night owls lookin to relaxxxxxxx~",1
Coffee Shop 5,"We came here late at night because it was one of the only places open, but it ended up being such a good choice. The barista was friendly, and the coffee ended up being so good. I got the great gatsby (highly recommend), and my friend got the Raven. Both had a good coffee taste and extremely smooth; delicious! The barista also informed us that the whipped cream is made in house, definitely a plus. Life really is too short to drink bad coffee :) Definitely coming back for seconds. Ordering and pick up area Whipped cream made in house -- absolutely delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I am something of a coffee connoisseur, and I've been all over Austin in search of the best coffee experience. Time and again, I come back to Bennu. It is my go-to coffee shop.  What to love: great food options, nice atmosphere, lots of outlets for working, but also great for sitting and chatting. Lots of friendly staff.  But: Knuckles is the best goddamn barista in Austin. She gives great advice on what to try, and makes brilliant concoctions of her own. Highly recommended.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List Came in because I was in search of a 24/7 coffee haven that would keep me awake prior to my ungodly early flight out of AUS.  Bennu was exactly what I was looking for...unpretentious little near eastside coffee nook where the seating was plenty, the espresso was strong, and there were enough computer outlets for everyone and anyone to plug-in and charge to their heart's content!  The very friendly barista did a great job of giving me what I needed at 2:30am...without judgement. My teabagged dirty Mate was just what I was needing after downing 3 beers earlier and the orange choc chip took the edge off of pulling a literal ""all nighter"".  I loved that there is an eclectic hodge podge of seating options (from barstools, to an array of office chairs, to hightop tables, to couches that look like engorged beanbags of comfy quicksand) and the people to match. I honestly think this place is the best overall demographic representation of the city of Austin I have ever seen encompassed in a single space!  The wifi is free (there is a one purchase minimum, but c'mon, you seriously gonna freeload in a place that has the equivalent of 101 flavored latte options?).  Should I ever endeavor on another early morning flight where painstaking awakeness trumps trying to squeeze in a two-hour power nap, this will be my go to!  So happy I discovered this lil gem!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I basically live in this place during semester, so I really have to love it. Good thing the coffee is good or I would be screwed! The Purple People Eater is a fucking godsend is you are looking for iced mate that actually tastes good and I'm a huge fan of the french presses and straight up espresso. If you was something a little sweeter, go for the Serenity, I don't think it's on the menu, but it's basically a dirty chia with white chocolate in it. And it's named after the greatest ship of all time. What more could you ask for? I'd get it based on the name alone. ... I'm not sure what that says about me.  Shout out to Knucky who is just flat-out one of the most kick ass baristas ever, and Charley who is just awesome and always beyond pleasant to interact with. I am absolutely terrible because I am totally forgetting the name of my other favorite barista.... She just chopped her hair off into the asymmetrical pixie and wears the black rim glasses, I also know she really like juniper.... Anyways she is also awesome for the interaction and coffee and stuff. You people are amazing and humor/deal with me pre-coffee. Thank you",1
Coffee Shop 5,"So I was driving around the east side looking for a cup of Joe. Not only did I find this place, but met Ari who was the most welcoming, kindest,  and  funniest barista I've ever met. Y'all need more people like her, oh and the coffee was great too!!! Awesome artwork and even better barristas",1
Coffee Shop 5,"2 check-ins I've spent many hours here over the years drinking coffee, eating cookies and sandwiches and working on whatever. Barista Aems and I tinkered with different Italian iced sodas earlier. Creamy blackberry with whipped cream and chocolate syrup was nice, but our prototype creamy watermelon with whipped cream and honey was pretty neat. It reminded me of. . . your lips and tongue and taste buds are thinking it's, like, a butter pecan milkshake or whatever, but then washing over and underneath and around and down your throat is this watermelon surprise. Next time we're thinking about cayenne and cucumber -- or I am, at least -- but also intriguing is maybe Irish cream or toffee nut with cinnamon powder. Anyway, definitely a fun way to punctuate the boring work of tonight. That whipped cream and honey creamy watermelon Italian iced soda I wrote about. Thanks, Aems. We started with a creamy blackberry Italian soda, but Ames made something magnificent with chocolate syrup and whipped cream.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Love their pastries and coffee- extremely disappointed that they've turned away favor & Postmates when we're in a pinch and would like it delivered. Postmates called and said its due to not getting tipped when in all honesty, this makes me want to go there myself to place an order and still not tip. It's ridiculous and you're getting paid hourly to do your job, if I was the owner of this place I would be livid from losing all of that delivery business. Up your prices .50 to make up for it then, don't turn the business away.",0
Coffee Shop 5,"There's something special about the sauntering aromas of coffee. When you walk through the door here, you are not greeted by upper echelon coffee snobbery with a side of middle aged angst. You are greeted by real people with great attitudes serving some of the best coffee in Austin.  Bennu is a hidden treasure among a surplus of modernist cookie cutter coffee shops that are taking over Austin. Now, I drink decaf. For a lot of people that may seem like a complete waste of time but when you have a debilitating illness, it's a comfort item. Bennu doesn't give you attitude with your coffee. When you walk in, you are not judged based on appearance or how much you know about cold brew processes. It's the type of place where you've just had four grueling finals and have taken more xanax your body knew was possible to handle. It's a slice of heaven, a utopia that's open 24 hours to cater to those of us that engage in academic masochism and work slave retail shifts. It's all around a fantastic community orientated place to just relax.  If you're looking for the fancy stuff, you should probably try elsewhere for your hearts and rosettas. If you're looking for a place where you can devour a slice of pizza in 30 seconds and chain smoke cigarettes like your lungs are made of steel, Bennu is your calling.  Shout out to Cynthia and Fred. They are always amazing but why don't you just compensate them rather than put up a weird sign?  Whatever, this place is great. I've spent many nights here pre and post-grad and it will always hold a semi-dysfunctional place in my heart.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Updated review Update: I've been going to Bennu since they opened way back when, and all of my original review below remains true. I can also say without a doubt that while the entire staff is excellent, Neil, Fred, and River are among the best baristas I've ever had the pleasure to have behind any counter anywhere when I'm indulging my caffeine addiction.  ***** Original Review *****  Check it out!  Great drinks, a cool space, friendly baristas (imagine that!), and open 24/7.  You're going to love Bennu, my friends.  LOVE IT!  Be sure to give their signature mochas a try.  The Raven and the Don Quixote rawk, and, though I've yet to try the other five, I'm sure they're good too.  This one is a definite winner, founded by folks with ties to other well-loved Austin coffee joints (dearly departed Mojos and ultra cool Epoch, to be specific) who know their stuff.  There's good food on the menu (Pizza from Hoboken, breakfast tacos from Tochy's, baked goods from Russell's) to help soak up all that caffeine, too.  Get out of that chain gang and into Bennu.  After all, this is Austin you're living in, not Dallas or Houston.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I've been recently doing a job located a block away from Bennu Coffee so I go there everyday for my coffee. I'm a avid coffee drinker and consider myself a expert when it comes to coffee. Bennu Coffee is if not the best coffee shop in Austin it's in my top two. Right with Spider House. Not only is the coffee good but the staff are ALWAYS upbeat and friendly. Even at 5:00 a:m when I come in sometimes.  Excellent coffee shop!!!!!  Only ""mustard"" would be the parking can get congested. But this is Austin. All the good spots have parking issues. Ha!!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I've been a regular here for awhile now, and I always tip well.  I often stop by to grab coffee, but don't stay.  Today I decided to stay, and one barista was completely rude.  Apparently I parked in a spot that isn't a spot -- but it isn't marked as such.  Really disappointed, because you're in my neighborhood, but I'll be going to Epoch instead now.  Don't yell at your customers if you can't bother to make a sign indicating a non-parking spot.  It's terrible customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 5,"Aems and Nadia show that teamwork is the way to run a business. I really appreciate that the baristas seem to be allowed a lot of creative freedom, because it shows in their work! The coconut milk latte I had was fantastic: great espresso and I love that they have coconut milk.  As always, excellent tunes!  The only con is the creepy sign about a cash prize for the highest reviewed barista. I'd prefer it if all the baristas were equally compensated!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu Coffee- where do I begin? Bennu is a godsend to the students of UT. Not only does Bennu offer an extensive selection of delicious mocha flavors, but the size of the mochas are very generous. Everything that I have tried on the menu has been more than satisfactory.  Aside from the never-disappointing coffee, Bennu has the atmosphere of your weird great aunt's sitting room- meaning, it's mysteriously cozy and adept with power outlets for an extended study visit with your laptop. Stay for an hour or all night, Bennu is open and giving great service 24 hours a day. Bennu latte",1

Coffee Shop 5,"This review is a long time coming. Plus tons of stars for being the most creative coffee shop in austin, having commmmfy sofas and tons of outlets and seating spots. I wrote 3 plays here, wasted tons of time in between east side meetings or came early in the morning when no where else was open.  Only con- Sometimes it gets a bit too noisy ( its usually super peaceful, so when this happens its a bit jarring.) Also they have the best french press decaf coffee- incredibly delicious! So when they are out of it, nothing else will suffice.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"3 check-ins This is a big coffeeshop with lots of seating and outlet plugs. The only terrible thing about Bennu is how dim it is. I was studying there one night and I literally could not see my keyboard because it was so dark. The coffee here is okay, I always get the iced bennu because its iced and sweet. The chairs are very comfy and they have all different kinds of chairs and couches and tables for you to work at. It's usually quiet here which is nice. Parking sucks because there aren't that many spaces and the parking lot is very small so its hard to maneuver your car around there.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Supper quiet.  No joke, seriously quiet. Lost of space, and most importantly it was warm!  Not freezing like most coffee places.  Coffee was great too! Very quiet. Great space",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu is a good place to get work done. There are lots of tables, chairs, and outlets. Like a lot of other local coffee shops, they do require a 1 drink purchase minimum.  I had no problems with the barista. Service was friendly and prompt.  As far as coffee goes, it's not incredibly impressive. I got a house brew with heavy cream. It was very very strong, nothing out of the ordinary for a coffee shop.  I will say that around finals (early-mid December, early-mid May) this place is PACKED with studying students. Definitely not a fault of the establishment itself, but just something to remember!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"As much as I love love love Bennu, I have to be honest, the coffee here is pretty mediocre. If you're looking for a place to sit and chill for a few hours at weird hours in the night this is definitely the place to go. The ambience here is what makes me think of this place when I'm not in Austin and what makes me want to come back here at 1am on a Saturday when I just want to chill. As long as they aren't blasting Britney Spears at 2am this place seems to always be filled with people and is a great place to get work done. the lighting on the inside and the outdoor patio is dimly lit but there is still plenty of light to get your work done. There's plenty of seating inside for groups or to just work alone. This place is non pretentious and not intimidating at all which is probably why I love it so much. the baristas are great-friendly and charismatic and always seem to help you with more than what you are asking for. If I went to UT or a neighboring school I would no doubt be in here all day.

Coffee Shop 5,"I love Bennu because it is a great place to study and have good coffee. I really like their chai which is much better than at other coffee places I've tried. The Bennu coffee its really good too. The cakes are delicious! The staff is friendly and helpful. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars, is because they don't have a lot to eat and considering their costumers stay long and I mean very long, there should be more menu items. So just know that if you get hungry you might need to go get food elsewhere and come back to your study session.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Good wifi! Pretty quiet and great for studying or working. Tables are a little haphazardly placed, some awkward maneuvering is needed sometimes to get by.  I got the Scarlet Letter which was nicely spiced, and my favorite part was that it wasn't blazing hot so I could start drinking it after less than a minute. Cajun turkey sandwich was basically turkey with jalapenos and a little bit of sauce, but I was hungry and it hit the spot. I also like how they toasted it.",1
Coffee Shop 5,I love coming to Bennu Coffee on Saturday mornings. I am greeted by the sleepy faces of Amy and Nuckie and we have a pleasant chat while they get my order.  There is a good selection of pastries. The coffee is great. It is a comfortable space. What more could you want,1
Coffee Shop 5,"Try their vegan pizza!  As a 24-hour coffee shop, it can be crowded as lot of students come for studying especially in the evening. I do love the vibe of the coffee shop and friendly baristas. They have gluten free desserts and I was surprised when I tasted their vegan pizza, it was delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Sometimes I feel like I should just pitch a hammock and move in because I spend a pretty good amount of time here during the weekends.  I love the cozy chairs and tables; they are perfect for study marathons.  And What better for study marathons than plenty of caffeine.  I have tried many of the menu items and I haven't ever been disappointed.  I am fairly new to coffee as I only started drinking it within the past year and the many of the things I do know now were learned here.  The baristas are always so nice to me; they're friendly and helpful.  Sometimes I am at a loss for what to order and they make me a Secret Latte Situation or a Mystery Mocha! I absolutely love that.  When I graduate and have to leave Austin, this will be on my list of top things I will miss the most.",1
Coffee Shop 5,Great coffee and great staff! This my favorite coffee shop in Austin!  Knuckie is awesome and always takes good care of us.,1
Coffee Shop 5,"How many broken chairs can someone fit into a coffee shop? I'm not sure because I lost count at Bennu. Seriously almost injured myself there. Came here to study, but it was so loud even my ear plugs didn't work.  Just wasn't an overall good experience, and I definitely won't make the drive out there again.",0
Coffee Shop 5,"One of my favorite places to work, especially with it being 24/7. Being right down the university (however only accessible by car), it is conveniently located to get away from the mass of students. I very much so enjoy the Iced Bennu here, being a fan of hazelnut. The ice is also soft and can be enjoyed as a crunch as you sip. The big downside for me was the wifi though, which is understandable consider the amount of client, but wifi is generally essential for most work or studying nowadays. I would really wish for better connectivity, either by upgrading tiers for speed, hosting a secondary wifi or limiting high traffic users.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Perfect place to study with your laptops, since there are so many tables and outlets. There was a lack of light at some corners tho, so be aware of that. Food and drinks are also good and decent priced. My friends got stuff from their mocha menus and absolutely loved it. My hazelnut latte was nice too. Bonus: the ""You're my butter half"" wall is right across from the cafe.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I love this place. I've been going every morning before work for the last six months. I love the staff there! it's cliche but they really do make you feel like family. Super real, down to earth baristas and damn fine coffee.  Big ups to Joe for making sure I always have cream in my coffee!  But really, big ups to everyone on staff there,Y'all make the morning better!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Two words: A MIE. Or one word if you're in a hurry, AMIE!!!! The best god dang dingdangity flimflamity shimshamity barista in all THE EAST(side). Go for Amie's expert coffee stylings, stay for the chill n spill (the beans, to a friend) everybody is your friend at Bennu.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu is by far the best coffee shop in central austin! It has Lots of OUTLETS, SEATING and incredible local ARTWORK! The Iced Bennu is a MUST if you go for the first time. Kristen is one of the coolest and most professional barista's there! She is very knowledgable on the selection and helps you make a choice on a drink if you are not sure. It feel likes home and there is a wide variety of music that gets pretty catchy overtime. And it is open 24/7! Enough said. Go NOW! [I've been going here for a bout 6-7years now]",1
Coffee Shop 5,Updated review Bennu reached out to me to fix the problem. I'm really happy with the customer service and will continue to be a customer!,1
Coffee Shop 5,"47 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" This is pretty much the exact conversation I have every time I go to Bennu:  (Putting my cup on the counter) ""Let's fill this with original."" ""That'll be sixty-two cents for the refill."" ""It's actually not a refill. It's my cup."" ""Thanks for being honest. $1.62""  (Twenty minutes later, putting my cup along with a dollar on the counter) ""This time it is a refill."" ""Don't worry about the sixty-two cents."" ""Thanks. Let's fill up the tip jar.""  Bennu is 24/7, it's usually crowded, and sometimes parking & seating can be inconvenient. But if decent coffee and hanging out late night at an Austin icon were easy, everyone would be doing it. They aren't. Some are. We should. Outside is sometimes far more laid back than inside...",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I'm not a fan of Bennu. There's never a place to park or a place to sit. I always go back to give it another try, and it's always a miss. Every time I've gone, the baristas weren't the friendliest people. You don't have to hold a full on conversation with me, but it'd be nice to have my politeness reciprocated. The music is also very distracting here. I always find it difficult to focus on my work or get studying done.",0
Coffee Shop 5,Absolutely love it here. It's a great place to study and the coffee and iced tea is amazing. Definitely coming back every chance i get. The only downside is that everyone loves it here so much that you have to snag a table quickly if you can. If thats the worst thing about this place then it must be great.  I would recommend my friends to come but i don't want it to get more crowded haha,1

Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu is just down the street from us and it has quickly become our neighborhood go-to in the coffee department. They make the most delicious almond milk latte around, and the friendly faces behind the counter are always a delight to see. It doesn't take long at all for Nucky to know your name, and you know you're a real regular when you get a nickname! We love this place.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu is a 24-hour coffee shop in East Austin with an amazing atmosphere and awesome baristas. This is my go-to study spot! However, It's a little loud if you're seeking a quiet place to read or work. Cynthia and Ames are friendly baristas and quick to recommend a drink or offer up witty banter :) This place is a gem in a trendy up and coming neighborhood and worth checking out!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Now Austin, this is the place to get the tea latte in town! I moved to Austin like a year ago and this was the first cafe I visited. The service was friendly and helpful. It's a good place to study or have a long rich conversation with your friend, especially because it's 24 hours. Everyone's really nice, but I gotta shout out to Xy because they're the one I interact with the most. They're such a hardworker but keeps their cool in the busiest times, while making one mean Texas Gold latte. Bennu's worth your trip and tip, come for a nice cup of tea!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"7 check-ins This is my go to coffee shop in Austin! Not only is it 24 hours which is awesome for students but they have amazing drinks! I've tried the Pride and Prejudice, Oliver Twist, and Great Gatsby and they're all sooo good. You can't go wrong with anything you order from here. They also have tons of electrical outlets which is a plus! I love not having to search for outlets when I'm busy working. Definitely a must try. Also, they're located right across the street from the You're My Butter Half mural :) Great Gatsby Iced coconut mocha Pride and prejudice",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Quiet local coffee hideout, try the iced Bennu it's like a Vietnamese coffee, so yummy! Had a slice of carrot cake that was gluten free and it had amazing flavor! I enjoyed working out on the patio and not having to sign in to use the wifi! Go check this place out the next time you need a pick me up or a quiet place to work.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Ari is probably the nicest, most talented, most well versed barista in all of central Texas. Her customer service is only out matched by her amazing ability to whip up the most amazing iced mocha you've ever tasted. Iced Raven no whip.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Bennu was a highlight of my Austin trip in terms of Coffee Shops Experiences! It was the first place we went to as soon as we settled into our AirBnB and it was really close. I was looking around Yelp and saw, oooh a 24 hour coffee shop?? Let's go! And it ended up being the most awesome coffee shop of Austin that I got to try. It is located right next to UT Austin so it was full of lively college students. There is local art on the walls. They were packed and there was nowhere to sit down so we didn't get to spend too much time there. The barista at the front was really nice, easy to talk to, and fun to interact with. They have a whole menu of mochas based off of classic novels. I still ended up sticking to an ""Iced Bennu"" which tasted strong, but subtle. It was the perfect coffee for me. But they had awesome mochas like ""Pride and Prejudice"" which I would definitely try if I came back here. It seems like a great study spot too. Only potential downfall could be the small parking lot, but I don't live here so maybe the locals just know where to park to get around that issue.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I went here on the Fourth of July and thought it wouldn't be busy, but it definitely was! At first all of the tables and people overwhelmed me but everyone was quiet and working on their own stuff, and I was able to grab a seat. It ended up being nice and had the community vibe that is so great about Austin. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was good, not the best I've ever had but this place deserves 4 stars because of the atmosphere!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Small snack/sandwich selection and the coffee is good. Most people who go there are working on their laptops or studying, so if you don't plan to do the same then you may feel out of place. It's a hip little hangout to do work and has a bit of outdoor seating available as well.",1
Coffee Shop 5,Really terrible service. It's a shame because it was my first time coming in and now I don't think I'll return.,0
Coffee Shop 5,"Best chai tea latte I've ever had-- the foam was so thick and creamy and the flavor of the chai was amazing. The place has lots of seating, yet even at 11:00 PM almost all of the indoor seats were taken so you do have to fight for a seat. Service was friendly and not snooty. However, the wifi doesn't have enough bandwidth to stream Netflix shows, so I wouldn't go there for that (the wifi was out in my place and I wanted to watch the new AHS). Cool atmosphere to study in, though!",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I really, really love this place. Their coffee is delicious and I've yet to be let down by anything in the pastry case. I also have to give major shout outs to the sweet baristas that always seem to keep smiling faces, even at 3 am when faced with a grumpy crowd of stressed out college students like myself. Ya'll rock!",1
Coffee Shop 5,This is literally my favorite coffee shop in Austin. Great atmosphere for studying and everything I have gotten has been simply delicious. I go here so often it is absurd.,1
Coffee Shop 5,"Great little location to get your study mode on. Of course it being 24/7 is what makes this the place to go. The only issue is that it fills up very quickly and gets pretty crowded. Parking is also very limited. But hey if you manage to find a spot, you're all good. They have a nice selection of pastries as well as sandwiches and pizza. (They have vegan options as well!) As far as drinks go, I usually get the Don Quixote or regular hot chocolate with a warm muffin. Don Quixote and chocolate chip muffin.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Gonna be hard to beat, I just took the barista's 1st suggestion, just said I wanted it cold and caffeinated, he nailed it. Happy I just moved near by! Oh, and I think it's a 24 hour Op, so.. too bad I'm not in college anymore.. Iced Blennu where it's at..",1
Coffee Shop 5,"So as other have mentioned this place has tons of outlets and ample seating. If nothing else was right, they could coast on the pure number of plugs alone. I mean they have extension cords hanging from the freaking ceiling, it's basically their business plan. The coffee was fine and the snacks are sourced from good places. I am only going 4 stars because the coffee wasn't amazing and honestly it's a little dark/dirty for my taste. Don't think I'm actually saying its gross, it's a coffee shop, it is what it is. This is definitely a 5 star place for some people, just not for me.",1
Coffee Shop 5,I don't think I can ever move just because this coffee shop is so close to my house and it's my absolute favorite!!! Just moments ago I walked in and they were playing 'total eclipse of the heart' and I felt obligated to sing along to it while I waited in line. Apparently my enthusiasm was enough to earn myself a free drink from one of the lovely workers here :) so sad to hear that people get upset by the music here! Petty!,1
Coffee Shop 5,PLEASE stop playing your terrible music -- love the set up but can't ever concentrate because of it and I'm definitely not the only person who feels this way.,0
Coffee Shop 5,"Good coffee and plenty of seating, though the place is a little loud.  I was reminded of my student days when I'd go to a coffee shop to study and get nothing done.  The food was decent, though I wouldn't make the trip just for that.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"This place is pretty great.  They have really yummy mochas and it's super cool/cozy inside.  There's a lot of seating which is also nice.  The baristas are really nice and helpful.  They have lots of yummy things to eat at pretty reasonable prices.  I have spent many a successful day studying at this location when I was in college, and would also recommend it as a place to hang out.  Unfortunately, parking is an issue.  Also, I would say their coffee is mediocre at best.  If you're going in for a beverage, I would stick to a tea or flavored coffee drink, unless you're just drinking the coffee to stay awake.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"I spent a morning here working from a laptop and it was pretty great. There are plenty of outlets, I easily found a seat, everyone there is friendly, and the vegan snacks were tasty. It was nice to have options for nutritious fare.  The only thing I could have enjoyed more was the coffee itself. My cappuccino was a little weak and generally lackluster.  I'll still be back!",1
Coffee Shop 5,For what it is this is a great place to go to. Don't expect too much. People smoke right outside the front door and I hate that. If they stop that obnoxious practice I'll give them 5 stars.,1
Coffee Shop 5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE...  ...and I will 100% update this review when they fix this hilariously bad wifi.  Wifi drops every few minutes, takes minutes to reconnect Wifi is slow, but hey, no worries there Wifi is insecure (!)  It makes me sad that I've had to LEAVE Bennu and go to another cafe on some days so that I can work uninterrupted online. Such a bummer.  Love the art Love the coffee Love the staff Love 24-hour  @Bennu Staff: reply if this gets fixed, I promise to give you 5-stars. The wifi is a deal breaker though.",0
Coffee Shop 5,"This my second time at this great coffee shop and I love it. I ordered the raspberry tea, great if you want something like after eating or before going home. Today I ordered cappuccino, that was really good with migas tacos and for lunch turkey sandwich with pesto, yummy. The ambience is soft lighting and intimate,  great comfortable chairs enticing to relaxation , reading or working peacefully.  The staff are super nice. Thanks to Charlie and all that help me ( I am handicapped ). This cafe is a winner!! Cappuccino and migas tacos at Benuu coffee shop. Delicious!! Great coffee shop.",1
Coffee Shop 5,"Love this place.  I recommend the Moby Dick for sweet coffee lovers.  It's fantastic they're open 24hrs as well; I loved that when I used to work nights.  Only complaint is the furniture is pretty worn and outdated but I guess it fits the Austin ""cool"" vibe!",1
Coffee Shop 16,Dolce Neve is the best gelato in Austin.  They have amazing and unique freshly made flavors.,1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins This is a hard review to write without finding myself craving gelato. But alas, Dolce Neve deserves a 5 star rating.  Dolce Neve's gelato is a little piece of Italy in Texas, and my favorite dessert spot in Austin. This cute little shop is a can't miss. Fun fact: The owner is from the US, and went to Italy to learn how to make gelato. I feel like I'm giving away my hidden gem, but this place definitely gets busy. There's a small parking lot in the back that I assume gets full during peak times.  I love that their service is friendly and patient, even in the face in indecisive customers who want to try all the gelatos (how do you pick two gelato flavors!). Everything is made in house and you can definitely tell - the gelato is very flavorful and creamy, but not too sweet and overwhelming. They have some staples, like mascarpone and lemon, and goat cheese and fig, and hazelnut. They also have a great variety of special flavors they make. I've seen matcha gelato (divine!), and sake (yes, the alcoholic one). Dolce Neve also offers gelato sandwiches and popsicles, which I've never tried - most of the times they are almost out of these when I go.  I highly recommend Dolce Neve!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"This place is super cute! Italian ice is always a great way to alleviate the Texas heat. I'd say Dolce Neve is very...Austin. The inside is quaint and small, yet very homey. There's a small parking lot in the back but I can imagine it getting full when this place gets busy.  The worker was patient with me when I wanted to sample basically every flavor (oops). When you taste it, you really can tell that the quality is solid. Flavorful and sweet. I couldn't ask for more. Overall it's a place to stop by to enjoy great Italian ice! Mmmm Yum",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Listed in It's Austin, Baby! Love this place! It's located right across the street from the ""Welcome to Austin"" mural!  They have great and interesting flavors. So nice to give you samples to taste them. I don't remember exactly which gelato I had. Can't go wrong with their granita too! Blackberry jam and ricotta gelato",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Phenomenal gelato! The prices are reasonable for the level of quality, the store is adorable, and the service was friendly. Can't ask for more!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Gelato. It's one of those words which make you wonder if it's really ice cream or not, but it is Italian Ice Cream, and yes, it's a dense food, but delicious and intense at the same time!  Dolce Neve offers a huge variety of flavors to suit all taste buds, from the sweet lemon, to the relaxing basil, to the bitter chocolate, and the alcoholic taste of Sake, they all taste good and their flavors combined makes the ultimate gelato!  While the indoor space is small, the gelato is perfect for in hand indulging and walking around enjoying the scenic views of Austin. In my opinion, this is my favorite gelato place in Austin, also offering popsicles and ice cream sandwiches! Popsicles and Ice Cream Sandwiches! Front entrance at night time",1
Coffee Shop 16,"One thing I've noticed about the Austin food scene is that the focus seems to be on the quaint little shop, or food truck, rather that the 150-seat venue that seems like it's a scene from that romantic comedy you saw a few years ago.  While I do like romantic comedies, lots of times I'd prefer the indie flick that hardly anyone's heard of, but is so entertaining.  Well, Dolce Neve is a mix of both.  It's not that big gelato shop with huge containers of gelato, but it's also not that small shop that's a speak-easy establishment.  They have almost 400 reviews and rated at 4.5 stars.  That's extremely tough to do on Yelp without people knowing about it.  We came on a hot Sunday afternoon.  Parking is located at the back and on the street.  As I said, the shop is small with about 4-5 tables (depending on if you put them together).  I was warmly greeted by both people working there at the time.  I told them it was my first time and they happily explained their offerings.  They have a good selection of gelato that is hand-scooped into a cup or cone.  However, my eyes immediately focused on their gelato sandwiches.  My wife went with the salted caramel ice cream bar and I followed suit with a Stracciatella........... after my 3 flavors of gelato.  Yes, while my wife went with the incredibly delicious salted caramel gelato bar, I went the traditional route and tried a cup of pistachio, chocolate, and salted caramel (recommended by the lady who helped me).  While all 3 were spectacular, the Stracciatella gelato sandwich was calling my name.  So, I ""man'd up,"" and got that, too.  =)  Everything was so unbelievably fresh and comforting.  I wish we had time in Austin to go back.    Tip:  The shop is right around the corner from the ""Greetings From Austin"" sign.  Go take the obligatory mural picture and then go enjoy some damn good gelato! Ricotta Chocolate, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio See all photos from Jamie J. for Dolce Neve",1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins Been here a couple of times and well it's the best Gelato we have ever had here in Texas! The gelato is always creamy and delicious and the flavors are always changing with a few staples that stay.  Both times we have been I have gotten coffee flavored as my staple flavor to always get and we got a couple of the other flavors that change. Each time each flavor is delicious and amazing!! The girls that have been there both times we were there are super nice and helpful, they let you try whatever flavors you want to try before you buy. Gotten a waffle cone once and it's amazing!! Apparently the waffle cones are made in house each day.  Overall one of our favorite dessert spots here in Austin and definitely a go to for us when we bring friends or family around for dessert when they are visiting!!  Come by and give it a try!!  Parking is in the back of the building and it's a little hard to get to so you might want to try to walk here if you can.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"This is my favorite gelato place in the country. I've always had a great experience here but let me share with you some of the things that make it different from other places.  The good.  Fresh ingredients. They locally source the majority of their products.  Unique flavors. Mascarpone and fig. Sweet creme with a twist of lime. Tiramisu. Apricot jam and vanilla.  Variety. They switch out flavors every so often. Also if you want an ice cream bar or a homemade ice cream sandwich, they have those too.  The environment. 1st street is a true Austin experience. This place is near a bunch of art galleries and the famous Austin sign.  The staff. Always smiling. Knowledgable. Kind. Accommodating. They never get impatient when you ask for samples.  A+++++++++++",1
Coffee Shop 16,"This is truly genuinely authentic gelato! Small place 'a la' Austin that has the best gelato I've tasted west of the Mississippi. These aren't the cheapest gelato out there but one sometimes has to pay for quality. One of the owners even went to Carpigiani Gelato University (Bologna, Italy) and worked at a world famous gelateria in Pisa, Italy. They apparently handcraft their flavors every day and I was lucky enough to try the Ricotta, Pecan and the Goat Cheese, Honey flavors (Wow!). They also have more traditional flavors but feel free to try out unique combinations. Nice outdoor pet friendly terrace",1
Coffee Shop 16,"5 check-ins This place is a great ""Go local"" place. Locally sourcing everything etc. I feel like for a place that has such a great following they could have more creative flavors.  Limited Seating, can get a little crowded.  Gelato flavors they do have are very tasty, and the icecream sammiches are awesome.  If you're bringing someone in from out of town and you wanna sit and enjoy a while, I would suggest visiting in non peak hours so you have some elbow room. :))))) Yum Orange flesh melon and barley Apple See all photos from Meredith W. for Dolce Neve",1
Coffee Shop 16,"This is what happiness tastes like.  Dolce Neve has the most interesting combinations of flavor known to gelato.  They are creamy, not too sweet, and to die for.  Unfortunately, I can't find the names of the two flavors I had... but one had fig in it.  This is definitely a place I will visit every time I am back in Austin.  I can never say ""no"" to Dolce Neve.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Wandered into this place right after a wonderful brunch at Bouldin Creek, it's right across the street. Love the area and even the ambiance in here, the pink chairs on the patio, the clean white interior - a very European vibe. Staff is of course friendly, you can taste as many as you want. Saw them make their own waffle cones fresh. I find the prices a little high but I am assuming they use good ingredients. I have tried them twice now, once also at a corporate event. Not a big fan of the actual gelato taste. I can't tell the difference from ice cream and not as good a gelato as I've had Italy (ok that may be an unfair comparison) but for me, I'd rather go for LICK than eat here. I had the dolce neve and salted chocolate. Tiramisu flavor was decent. Didn't like both that much. I did see they have gluten free ice cream sandwiches, so next time I'll definitely try that. Until then.. Gluten free ice cream sandwiches See all photos from Yuvaraj V. for Dolce Neve",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I love going to a small hole in the wall, that uses fresh ingredients and tastes fresh. Especially when it comes to ice cream!  The ice cream here is delicious, and their homemade cones are even better.  I would definitely come back here again.  One down side is the place is not made for people to sit and linger for a long time, it is quite small and cramped if you have a group of people.  Also not enough seating or tables for many people to be there at once.  BUT THE ICE CREAM IS AMAZING.  Just eat and walk :)",1
Coffee Shop 16,"What a cute spot in the south 1st area! This little house has house made gelato, including some exotic but delicious flavors, gelato sandwiches, and gelato pops. All very beautifully displayed- which makes it that much more difficult to choose what to get.  I went with a medium cup because I was able to combine 3 flavors. My flavor choices were goat cheese and strawberry (sounds weird but my favorite!), organic coffee, and the chocolate chip flavor (it has a complicated name that I would for sure misspell). All flavors were sweet and delicious.  Though quite pricey, dolce neve provides quite the experience with yummy dessert and a cute little atmosphere. It is definitely a dessert spot to visit if you are in Austin! Medium- combine 3 flavors!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Even though I only tried one thing here, that one thing was enough to make me want to come back and try the other things. I love gelato, even though they didn't have my favorite flavor, and they only had a few options left since it was the end of the day, I picked the salted caramel sandwich. I anticipated it being super sweet and that I won't like it since I just had a huge dinner across the street. It was the exact opposite of what I expected. It was a perfect bite! the chocolate cookie was bittersweet and it balanced well with the salted caramel gelato. I would've finished it all, but I had to share with Mr. fiancé. blah.. :) Mmm.. good! Salted caramel See all photos from Quyen B. for Dolce Neve",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Sample. Sample. And sample some more! This cute little gelato shop is not only creative, but delicious, too!  This was a great place to grab dessert with some friends after a heavy dinner. Not only were the staff super friendly, they had a variety of unique and delicious flavors to choose from.  What I really liked was the portion sizes. A small size really was a small size and they packed it in there. It wasn't too gluttonous, but just the right amount to satisfy that sweet tooth before a nightcap. If you did want to do dessert the right way, they had plenty of options to help you hit that goal! Unfortunately I was stuffed, but can never turn down the invitation for gelato!  I was indecisive when it was my turn, but the guy behind the counter was super patient and friendly. I tried the salted caramel, bourbon whiskey and pecan, tiramisu, and chocolate. I ended up with the chocolate and it didn't disappoint. They did have a Mexican hot chocolate or Mayan alternative (can't remember the actual name), but still, the plane Jane version of cocoa won me over.  They have an awesome patio to hang out out when the weather is nice. I could only imagine that this place is a prime hangout during the warmer months. I wish you were closer Dolce Neve, but we'll have to rekindle this romance the next time I'm in your neck of the woods!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins Best gelato in Austin?  Probably.  Dolce Neve is one of those cutesy finds in South Austin (of course it is) that everyone likes to claim as their own hidden gems.  Wonderful flavors like fromage blanc with apricot or goat cheese and fig jam highlight their adventurousness. Classic flavors like coffee, stracciatella, chocolate and marscapone are executed with excellence.  They also have an assortment of gelato pops, sandwiches and cookie gelato creations, some of which are gluten and dairy free!  Unfortunately like everything else, their success is their biggest failure.  On a typical Saturday night you can expect to not get a place to sit and some of the flavors will be sold out but such is life when you want to taste the best.  Don't worry about FOMO. Go to Dolce Neve and taste for yourself and next time leave earlier!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"One of my favorite ice cream places in Austin, which says a lot since I've been to many.  Their flavors are all seasonal and unique and delicious. Full of flavor and I've never had trouble finding two that I've liked.  Their portions have gotten smaller though and it's a little on the pricey end for gelato. Delicious though.  Also it's very cute which a beautiful white interior and a bright patio outside.  If you ever are lucky to try the plum one, it's delicious. Also their beets was good as well as their pumpkin.  Parking can be tricky sometimes but hopefully you'll get lucky haha",1
Coffee Shop 16,Great gelato! I like that they serve coffee as well. Perfect combo for the winter months.,1
Coffee Shop 16,"So, typing with nails is hard.. And I really want to clip them but.. Its just such a pain to do this every single month! WHY?! I am going to do out of my ordinary and just do a simple list and try to keep things simple.  I liked how they...: - Had vegan, and other food allergies and limitations for those who have those. - Clearly labeled. - SAAAA-AAAMPLLLLESS!!! - Choice of cones. - All made in house. - All made with local ingredients. - Had their own sandwiches and other novetaly ice creams. - Super friendly staff to noobs. (I was... gosh, so nooby.)  What I wish could be done better: - $$$.. ouch.... - Seating? But I know that is hard. - Oh my god that parking lot....  Bottom line: I really liked Dolce Neve. I will totally come back when I need that fix for Gelato and have enough money to pay for it.  Also, I like how close it was to where I was staying.  (Sorry guys... My fingers are really feeling the pain.)",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Best gelato in Austin, friendly staff, unique flavors-  Will keep coming to Dolce Neve for as long as I live in Austin",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Their flavors are amazing. I loved the organic hazelnut and salted caramel. They are mild and natural flavors, nothing overly sweetened. It tastes so wholesome and natural. I had a small serving in their house made waffle cone. I really enjoyed how it was lite and crisp but not hard. I expected the cone to be filled a little bit more but it was still good. Waffle cone with salted caramel and organic hazelnut",1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins Great little gelato place on South 1st. Parking is tricky but don't let that deter you. Their pistachio gelato is not always available, because the owners are very picky about the ingredients they use, and this year good pistachio seems to be harder to source than I'd like. But when they do have it, both my wife and I love it.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I didn't expect gelato to be THIS good. NOT in the State of Texas. They quickly evoked my memory and love for Latteria's gelato in Miami. For sure, the gelato is the best I've had in the entire State - beating the bigger city powerhouses of Dallas and Houston.  The gelato here is made fresh daily - you can come early enough to even sample them as they're churning out gelato with their imported Italian gelato maker that's proudly (and rightly so) displayed behind the glass.  And the flavors? Authentic Italian, and authentic Texan. Italian in the ways that they have the typical Italian flavors (stracciatella) and the less-common Italian flavors (cassata, even with pieces of candied fruits!!!); and they have things Texan (whiskey and pecan). And they were all truly the freshest and great-tasting gelato that I've had in almost anywhere.  Of the flavors I tried, I loved the Whiskey & Pecan, Cassata, and Opal Basil. My cousin also raved about their pistachio flavored ice cream but the didn't have it the day I was there (or I just simply found out about it too late!)  I also was surprised that they have American style ice cream sandwiches - and with Italian gelato flavors. That's something that I haven't seen much of since most Italian gelato shops I've seen make their ice cream sandwiches with a brioche.  This is a must visit when you're in Austin - the caliber is bar none! Plenty of flavors here - more than what you can see here Ice cream sandwiches - even with Italian gelato flavors Imported gelato maker, nice!",1
Coffee Shop 16,Yummy and unique gelato place. There is parking in the back but minimal spots. Try the almond custer and salted caramel! They have flavors that wasn't normal like goat cheese and wild blueberries jam... Anyways if you can do the drive then go for it!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"I freaking LOVE Dolce Neve~~~!!!!!! After coming to Austin I made it a goal to visit every big name gelato shop here and not that my take is very different from everyone else writing reviews for this place, but THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST ONE!!! (((in my humble opinion))) The gelato here is not too sweet and very light, which is why I like it more than all the other places!! Every time I come I stand around trying all the flavors because they're just all SO good and the workers here are so nice and everything about this place is just PERFECT  The decor inside and out is soooo cute and honestly I'M JUST SO THANKFUL THAT DOLCE NEVE IS EXISTS.  favorite flavors so far: stracciatella, hazelnut, honey and bee pollen, ricotta thyme and goat cheese, walnut, pistachio  ¡!!¡also PSA for UT students the 10 bus leaves from San Jac on campus and has a stop directly in front of Dolce Neve so take advantage of that if you don't have a car!!!¡! small stracciatella or however you spell it",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Best gelato anywhere!!! The owners are sweet and you can tell they use quality ingredients. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so all the flavors here are perfect. Honestly nothing else in town compares to Dolce Neve!  They also make AMAZING gelato cakes! Ever since I found out it's the only cake I'll get for birthdays and celebrations. Do yourself a favor and order one for your next event, it'll blow everyone away.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I like ice cream, I like gelato, I like sugar. So I knew I had to come check this place out. They make all of their ice cream in house and even make their own waffle cones.  Never thought I would say this but I think I liked the cone better then the ice cream. They have some how mastered the perfect mix between hard cone and melt in your mouth waffle. Unlike many waffle cones out there, they are either tasteless or rock hard. This one seemed to be perfectly in the middle.  The ice cream was quite tasty but I won't say it was the best. I do really want to go back and try the ice cream sandwich though.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Listed in Four Stars, Austin, TX While running around Austin with my Yelpy pals after hours, we wanted dessert after a fantastic dinner. Nearby we had seen this ice cream shop and set our sights on it before even paying our bill at dinner.  They were super sweet inside, and I don't mean just the gelato. We were able to try a few options before settling in with our choices. I'm always so amazed at how filling just a small size of the stuff can be! All those rich flavors really are satisfying.  On a scale of gelato from 'round the world that I've had the pleasure to try this was a solid experience - I was a fan of the flavors offered and the gelato sandwiches were super tempting!! they will also do a custom Gelato cake for you with a few days notice - I mean, what a birthday that would be!!  It's owned by a lady, her love and her brother - so support small business and give it a try!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"We stumbled upon this place since it was near a restaurant we had dinner at. The place is tiny and cute. There's a patio with pink chairs and tables as well as indoor seating.  There were so many flavors to choose from! The workers were super nice and let us sample whatever flavors we wanted! My top 3 favorite were-  1. Dolce neve/house (egg custard and lemon zest)- this was so light and refreshing because of the lemon. It seemed a bit more like a fusion of gelato and sorbet. Just enough tanginess for lemon lovers!  2. 70% chocolate- I LOVE dark chocolate so this flavor was a no brainer. It wasn't too sweet with just the perfect amount of bitterness.  3. Organic pistashio- for pistashio lovers this is a must! Also if you don't like sweet things, this one is your pick.  I ended up getting a small with the organic pistashio and 70% chocolate since I was limited to 2 flavors with that size. It's enough for one person and cost around 4.50 which I feel is a bit pricey.  Overall, I likey! :D Organic pistachio & 70% chocolate",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I walked over to Elisabeth Street Cafe and noticed Dolce Neve on my way. A sign that said 'local, Italian Gelato' was practically shouting my name. I love gelato. It is literally one of my favorite things in this world. I decided to walk over and pop my head in to assess the situation. They looked like they were putting sincere effort in here. As I did not want to spoil my dinner, I decided to wait until after dinner and head back over.  We were a group of about seven people and the staff was ready to help. I tasted a couple different flavors and settled on the chocolate mascarpone with salted caramel, because everyone knows chocolate and caramel go together like, well, chocolate and caramel.  The small cup is tiny, but they manage to pile the ice cream so incredibly high! It was good quality and definitely hit the spot for my ice cream craving.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Really amazing gelato! This place, at least in my friend group, is mostly unknown despite having some of the best ice cream in town. The place is in a very tiny house on S. 1st, but is pretty cozy and has a generally nice atmosphere. Parking may be a bit tough - there's about 5 or so spots.  Their flavors are quite unique, like Goodflow honey, hazelnut (and not just ice cream studded with hazelnut - a hazelnut ice cream!), and goat cheese. And it's awesome that they source a lot of their ingredients locally!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Listed in 2015 Reviews, Texas, Desserts!, ATX, Hangout spots Dolce Neve is just amazing. The gelati were great, and they were made all the more amazing by the passion of the owners about their product.  Leo was the person who helped us out on our visit, and since we went when it was not busy, he was able to tell us about how they got started. He pointed out to us that what you see is what you get. Their business model is all about transparency: everything was made in front of everyone. On our visit, he was making the gelato base and macerating strawberries. And there were no unpronounceable ingredients around!  Now to the gelati... They were amazing! We were able to try the grapefruit and mint sorbet, and mascarpone & lemon before settling on the gianduja and chocolate with orange peels. Everything we tried was divine. The gianduja did not skimp on the hazelnut flavor without sacrificing any of the amazing chocolate flavor. The chocolate with orange peels was also great with the nice citrus aftertaste.  It is a shame that Dolce Neve is not in my neighborhood. I can see myself hanging out here and learning more about gelato and really, just having a pleasant conversation with Leo. Next time I am in Austin, they may well be my very first stop. Storefront Flavored Macerating strawberries See all photos from Clarice O. for Dolce Neve",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Oh how I adore this lovely little gelato shop.  Walking in, you feel like you stumbled upon the neighborhood's best kept secret until you realize....it isn't. Everyone knows about this place. In fact, everyone knows about this place and I didn't get the memo.  I've been here twice now and have loved everything I tried. They have unique pairings like goat cheese, honey, and black/blueberry and classics like stracciatella that just...make you feel so warm and fuzzy inside because of the memories these flavors elicit.  THEY ALSO HAVE POPS! Like, chocolate covered gelato pops! This is my favorite. The chocolate that they use is exceptional, dark, but not too bitter. Also, gelato sandwiches.  It is a bit pricy but for quality product, a splurge isn't so hard to reconcile from time to time. Plus, the flavors are so out of this world...makes me want to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Dolce Neve, you are a little piece of Italy in the heart of Austin and I love you so much.  The gelato was so delicious, and tasted really similar to the gelato I had in Italy! It is melt in your mouth good.  I tried the raw pistachio gelato which was AMAZING.   I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was PACKED to the brim.  Finding seating may be difficult as the shop is very small, and there are only about 3 tables inside and 3 outside.  However, you can just take it to go and walk along S 1st St!  I highly recommend this place to anyone, very very delicious gelato.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"One of the only places you can come to in Austin that serves up pure goodness without some bearded,  butt - buddy serving a trendy, overpriced cocktail or pretentious, southern- fusion dish.  Its a cheap date and you can expect a handy on the car ride back your crappy apartment.",1
Coffee Shop 16,I loved this place! It's a cute little gelato shop downtown that has the best unique favors. You can try as many samples as you want. I got the ricotta honey flavor which I highly recommend it's definitely not too cheesy or anything. The matcha tea also has just the right amount of sweetness. The cream flavor (cant remember name) is not too original but still tastes ok. They fill the cup all the way to the top so you don't feel like they're skimping out on giving you any ice cream,1
Coffee Shop 16,"5 check-ins Listed in Just A Spoonful of Sugar, Ice Cream, Gelato, and Shaved Ice! My favorite gelato place in Austin. I will come here any chance I get! :)  My favorite flavor of all time is their black raspberry coconut gelato. It is so pretty and tastes so good. (Coconut haters stay away). I also hate raspberries, but I don't think this has a very strong raspberry flavor! I also like their Dolce Crema (?) flavor which is like an egg custard with lemon flavor. The workers are super nice (especially Janice! hehe), and the portions are worth what you pay.  They also have yummy gelato sandwiches I have yet to try. Will try eventually!! A con would be that they do not offer a lot of sorbet flavors. They will usually have one or maybe two, but I feel like they don't rotate it as often as the gelato flavors. The good sorbet flavors are lemon and grapefruit.  The whole shop is really cute. They do have limited seats though (indoor and outdoor). Another plus is they have private parking in the back.  I would so work here if I could drive because I'm already giving them so much of my own money HAHA. YES it's here! Black raspberry coconut milk (vegan & sorbet)",1
Coffee Shop 16,Amazing flavors that change out. Not too sweet or unsweet. Great customer service! Cute location. Fair prices for product! Good gelato! Local farmers and artisans are used!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"If you like a creamy consistency with your ice cream, I'd say Dolce Neve is your best bet. My boyfriend and I shared a medium cup which allows for 3 scoops. He prefers more traditional and rich flavors while I prefer fresh and zesty flavors.  We compromised by getting Dolce Neve, Vanilla bean, and Organic hazelnut. Dolce Neve had a subtle hint of lemon which I absolutely loved. Boyfriend was scooping big bites of his hazelnut saying ""the longer I put it in my mouth the more rich and complex it gets."" We both got what we wanted and enjoyed our time. Would go back!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Cute little gelato shop! I got the goat cheese and blueberry gelato/ ricotta almond combo and it was so good! There is definitely parking in the back so feel free to drive over. I paid just shy of $10 for a small cup and a ice cream bar- totally worth it on such a nice day. The lady helping us out was super sweet and was more than patient in letting us try different flavors.  It's seeing shops like this in Austin that makes me glad I moved here. Keep it up, team!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Listed in 200 Review Self-Challenge, Sweet Tooth Okay, coming off of my two-month excursion in Buenos Aires, Argentina and eating my share of gelato I was very judgmental of Dolce Neve but I had to give it a chance. Walked here from a taco food truck a few blocks away although I will repeat what other Yelpers mentioned, they have a private parking lot in the back. It was around 10pm and the place was pretty full, all the tables and seats were taken. After reviewing the options the server recommended I try some flavors including vanilla basil and chocolate orange. It was like a flavorful party in my mouth! I was also told that they partner with local farms and shops so much of the flavors change according to what items are in season and fresh.  I tried the two flavors together and it was so delicious. Creamy consistency and lasted for 20 mins without melting to soup. Also ordered a plain shot of espresso which reminded me of my cafe days in Buenos Aires. *sigh* As memory serves, Dolce Neve was on point giving a full service and nostalgic experience worth every expensive penny. I was lucky to get a seat and table before a huge line of people came in. Space is limited so if you come with a group of four or more keep that in mind. There is some sitting outside on the porch but during the winter months, probably left for the heartiest of folks.",1
Coffee Shop 16,3 check-ins I LOVE the gelato of Dolce Neve! You can easily understand it is made with quality products. Five stars for sure! Chocolate and caramel. Love it!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"Love this dessert shop so much! The decorations and atmosphere are fantastic, and the gelato is delicious! We got the popular goat cheese and jam, 70% chocolate, and the tiramisu. I loved the grittiness of the tiramisu, the goat cheese was unique and tasty, and the 70% chocolate was so rich and not too sweet. Definitely stop by if you get a chance!",1
Coffee Shop 16,What a fantastic little accidental discovery!  Who would've thought you can mix together candied chestnut and a peanut-butter like pistachio flavor together to create such amazingness in your mouth. Mind is officially blown.  The people were super nice too and we felt like they've been in the area forever despite its unusually modern decor in the midst of old Austin un-architecture.  Add this spot in your Austin ice cream/gelato adventures. A sleeper hit!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"OMG, and not just because it's in the hood.  I found this place at the recent Wine & Swine festival--they were there, serving bacon ice cream (oh yes, they did)   Naturally, I had to follow them home.  Cute little house on S. 1st, full of folks at 10p.m. on a Friday night.  Amazing choices and so many that I wanted to try.  Having become a bit annoyed with the guy in front of us who held up the line trying all of them... I decided to dive right in.    Don't let the high price scare you to death, I ordered the small and not only were they able/willing to put two flavors in there, they packed it in like you wouldn't believe.  I selected a salted chocolate that I adored and a toasted hazelnut that was a little sweet for me. Mixed, this was my perfect ""sweet"" spot.  My man chose the namesake flavor, which is a custardy, melt in your mouth, perfect sweetness with a hint of lemon.  I could probably eat that all day long.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"This may be the cutest little place I've ever been to :)  I was there right when they opened at 11am (lol) and really enjoyed a friendly chat with one of the owners, Leo, who is actually from Italy. I'm no gelato expert but I do enjoy it from time to time. I had it a few times in LA and once in Vegas and I don't think the flavors were anything unique like what they have at this place.  I had a small cup mixed with 3 flavors: strawberry, chocolate and blackberry coconut (I'm 99% sure of the name, can't exactly remember, and I don't see it listed on their website)...They were ALL delicious and ALL vegan which made me extremely happy! :) My favorite was the chocolate as it was very rich.  This is such a charming, cute, pleasant little place with wonderful owners and great gelato. Strawberry, Chocolate, and Blackberry Coconut...All Vegan!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins Listed in Let It Snow! :D, That Weekend in Austin Best gelato I've had since Italy! I absolutely loved the Mascarpone & Lemon Zest flavor. It had the correct creaminess expected from authentic gelato, and a flawless balance of light and sweet with a slight acidic kick from the lemon zest. The ricotta honey pistachio was also delicious.  Parking is a struggle and the line can be kind of slow, but it is worth it! If you value quality, Dolce Neve is a fantastic option for dessert. Pistachio, and Mascarpone & Lemon Zest",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Quality over quantity. That's what this place is all about.  The workers here are always patient and polite even if I ask for a bajillion samples.  Their gelato cups look super small at first for the price but you're paying for all natural, fresh, organic goodness. They usually have 10 or more flavors on the menu so there's a good variety to choose from. You can choose 2 flavors for the small cup (~$4), 3 flavors for the medium cup(~$5.5) and 4 flavors for the large (~$7). They also have vegan options made with coconut milk! My favorites are the hazelnut and the salted caramel.  There is lots of free parking in the back although seating is limited in the store. However people come and go frequently so there's usually always an empty seat whether outside on the patio or inside. The purple flavor is vegan! Made with coconut milk",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Updated review 14 check-ins My fave flavor is their Stracciatella and I always call before heading over to see if they have it. They're never impatient and will even pull it out from the back freezer for me!  Writing an update because we walked in the other day and when they didn't have any of my lovely Stracciatella, I politely said I would come back later when they did. I usually will get other flavors but I just hard a hardcore craving that day. The owner was there and said he would MAKE a whole batch of it and that it would be ready in 30 mins.  Now THAT is service. Five stars again for Dolce Neve. Heaven I'm in heaven Owner hand cutting strawberries for Strawberry Mascarpone gelato!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Found this place on Yelp and I ca see why it's rated so well! When something tastes really good and has a strong but developed flavor, I get a certain awesome food sensation that I just have to verbally describe. The Salted caramel was the bomb. Tiramisu was legit. Dolce Neve rocks my socks. Great customer service, and while it's busy, they aren't pushy and are willing to let you try several flavors and await your decision. And it's busy rightfully so! Yet still somehow, the locale has a very quaint old-house ambiance, which goes nicely with the creamy ice cream / gelato. I won't forget you, Dolce Neve...",1
Coffee Shop 16,"6 check-ins These guys always have really good flavors. So inconsistent, but consistent! Parking is kind of tricky if you haven't been here before. Make sure you follow the flow of traffic since the parking lot is a one-way.  One day when I grow up, I'm going to be gelato. Waffle coney cone cone waffle ice cone",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Yum! And my first impression was: aww, what a cute gelato shop :)  I asked the guy who was helping me what his fav flavors were and which two would be a good combo - going by his suggestion, I got the chocolate with candied orange peels and fromage blanc with apricot jam. Both were strong flavors by themselves and combined, created an interesting and tasty concoction.  I thought their flavor selections were fairly unique. But the prices are a bit high - it was a little over $4 for a small (2 scoops).",1
Coffee Shop 16,Tried this place over the weekend and it was delicious! The waffle cone was great and fresh. Their flavors are unique and different but every flavor I tried plented together well and was great.I can't wait to be back to try all the other flavors!  They have a small parking lot which we were lucky to get a spot in but was full by the time we came out. There is plenty of street parking on the side street though.,1
Coffee Shop 16,"Gelato lovers beware- you will not be able to decide which flavor, all so good and many creative delicious flavors. Reasonably priced, short walk from SoCo. Definitely worth the calories!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I went here last year (2015) for my birthday, February 20th! I've finally got to posting a review a year later haha... Anyways, I went with my friend and when we walked in, the place was really cute! It was a bit small, but it's all good. The workers let us taste test any of the flavors we asked for and were polite.  I got vanilla and salted caramel and my friend got chocolate and earl grey tea! I highly recommend the salted caramel! The flavors were very enriching as well as light.  I would definitely go back to this place. It's a nice atmosphere with good employees and the gelato is well made.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"4 check-ins I'm pretty biased because one of my good friends, Allison Y., used to work here, so whenever I'm in Austin, this is the first ice cream/gelato/cold treat shop I think to go to. I like the different flavors and that they're always making new ones so I feel like I never get the same flavors, except salted caramel. That one's a classic. They let you try any flavor you like and as many as you like. My friends each tried six flavors last time, and the servers were super friendly. Their popsicles are good, too. Even though the cups look small, they actually contain quite a bit of gelato! I like their waffle cones, too, which are never stale to me.  I do not like that they only have a few chairs and tables. Whenever I come, I always come in groups, and we have to move the chairs around or there aren't enough chairs. Also, parking kind of sucks. There are only 5 or so unmarked spaces in the tiny ""backyard"" and getting in and out almost always makes me feel like I'm going to hit a pedestrian.  Still, the gelato is good enough to keep me coming back without a second thought!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"It was delicious but not lifechanging. I tried most of the flavors and they were definitely good. I had the dulce neve(yellow), sweet corn and blueberry and chocolate 70%.  The total came out to $5.60 for a medium. I would recommend the medium bc the small( which is significantly smaller) is around $4.50.  The place is super cute with a small porch area out front for ppl to sit and hangout.  Parking is tight, with some spots in the back. Medium cup",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Awesome flovers, it tastes fresh and not over sweet. Also recommend getting the ice cream in the cup instead of the bar.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Holy sh*t, that was good! Thank goodness for the lovely server at Uchi recommending this place (just cause it's her fave). She knows what she is talking about! I could not even recall what extremely unusual flavors I picked out, but I was so drawn to all-things-odd that I picked two strange combos, and those Gods just shoved it in tight and stacked it up tall for me to enjoy. That tee-tiny cup fit so much, and I left so extremely satisfied. Don't even ask what these flavors are. They're not normal or usual... but, oh, were they DELICIOUS!! Don't even ask what these flavors are. They're not normal or usual... but, oh, were they DELICIOUS!!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"3 check-ins I heard about this gem from a friend who also knows his food. I was in Austin for a week, and I visited this spot twice in that time. The gelati are amazing, and the flavors offered change every day. When I went by on a Saturday afternoon, one of the owners was making a fresh batch. I wish I could have tried it right then and there, but good things take time.  The first time I went in, I asked one of the staff which two flavors I absolutely had to try since I am not often in Austin. She looked unsure and proceeded to sell me on every flavor they had that day. Having run out of flavors to introduce, she told me to try all of them if they all sounded interesting, and I did after her gentle arm-twisting. After careful deliberation, I decided on the peach sorbet with mascarpone and fig gelato in a small cup. I savored every tiny bite.  The second time, I tried another copious number of flavors and went for the Crema Dolce Neve (egg custard with lemon) and chocolate with candied orange peels. Again, mind-blowing.  Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely going to try their gelato sandwiches and gelato pops. Thai basil + buttermilk with butternut squash and sage in a waffle cone. Behind is the big gelato machine where the magic happens. It's hot out, baby! Chocolate with candied orange peels and Crema Dolce Neve (egg custard with lemon) with a vanilla wafer Marscapone & fig gelato with peach sorbet See all photos from Tiff T. for Dolce Neve",1
Coffee Shop 16,"5 check-ins Awesome experience! Great tasting gelato and even better service.  They have so many varieties of different flavors. Some may not appeal to you, but I encourage you to try as many as possible in order to find your perfect flavor. The best part is that the workers are super friendly and let you try as many as you want. Sometimes when I go into ice cream shops and try a bunch of flavors the workers don't seem too happy, but the people here want you to try as many as you want!  I had a small with the dolce neve flavor (I think that's what it was called.... It was lemon and egg custard I believe?) and pistachio. The pistachio was OUT OF THIS WORLD. You have to try this flavor. It's not like regular pistachio ice cream. The pistachio nuttiness comes through so well and rich. At first it was very strong, but as I ate it the smoothness took over and I was sold. The other flavor was great as well! The lemon made the flavor lighter and counteracted the richness of the pistachio really well.  The environment of the place makes it feel like your grandmas house. I can't wait to come back and try some more stuff! The ice cream is more on the expensive side, but the flavors and experience are well worth the price! Pistachio and dolce Neve(? It's the egg custard and lemon zest one)",1
Coffee Shop 16,Best gelato/ice cream in Austin! Everything is freshly made from organic ingredients and you can definitely taste the difference.,1
Coffee Shop 16,"First Time: Walked in, smelled like vomit.  Gelato wasn't impressive at all, so I don't even remember what flavors I ordered.  I do remember ordering the ice cream sandwich, which was pretty bland.  Second Time: I really wanted to like this spot.  I have friends who are OBSESSED with their gelato.  This time, I tried these flavors: Dolce Neve + Rose Water Pistachio + Salted Caramel + Goat Cheese w/ Chocolate Chips.  Flavors were obviously unique and good, but the consistency was not smooth, but rather icy.    I do want to call out that the service is friendly and quick.    I think I'll stick with my other gelato spots in town...",0
Coffee Shop 16,Updated review Tiramisu and chocolate mascarpone are the most amazing flavors I have ever tasted together! This place has created my heaven :) Tiramisu and chocolate mascarpone = wow!!!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"My interaction here was small, but the staff was friendly and let me taste whatever I wanted. I'm into goat cheese and was pretty decided when I saw it, but entertained other flavors.  The tiniest cup even felt like too much, it will feel pretty steep for the size ($4 and change) until you start eating it and you're like did I need this much? Was there a smaller size? Will I finish it? You might doubt yourself depending on your food intake prior, but I believe in you.  A single scoop really goes a long way. So don't forget that.  The coffee situation made me a baby bit sad. I was batted away from a latte when the staff told me the almond milk doesn't foam well. And that's okay, I appreciate their dedication to technique. I ended up walking a block or two down to the food truck park to get a cup at Holy Cocoa so things worked out. They really did, thanks for caring.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I made it a goal to hit up all the ice cream and gelato spots in Austin. Being raised here for all my life, you would think I could easily complete that task but alas no.  Something about this cute little spot makes me want to come back every time I crave sugar. Perhaps its because it's located in a semi-secluded area, where many tourists don't go and the workers as well as the customers always seem familiar.  It's like a little piece of heaven that's not crowded, and even when it is, it still provides that dainty homey feel. How's that for descriptive adjectives?  Aside from the atmosphere, their gelato never disappoints, no matter what flavor you choose. The inside of the house is adorable and I just  love everything about this hidden gem.",1

Coffee Shop 16,"Dolce Neve never ceases to impress me!  Pros: -Every time I come, there are new flavors to try. Whoever comes up with the unique flavor pairings is churning gelato with his/her heart and soul. -the servers were patient and gave us so many samples before we could decide what to order! -sorbet or gelato, it's all darn good! I especially like their multiple variations of chocolate, and lemon gelato.  Neutral: -I dunno if it's because of sheer luck that every time I've gone, my friends and I have found a table to sit as well as a parking space. Parking spots and chairs are sparse, but when you get them, it's easy to have a great experience!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I'm not a big ice cream fan, but Dolce Neve is definitely one of my favorite places to get ice cream if I'm ever craving it. Actually, it's probably one of two places in Austin that I'll only get ice cream at. They have a plethora of unique flavors so I would definitely ask to sample some of the flavors. The staff here is really nice and always willing to give out suggestions.  The place itself is cute and small. It can get pretty crowded in here, depending on when you come. Nonetheless, the line moves pretty fast. There is seating available inside, but if all the tables are taken, you can eat your ice cream in the car. Haha.  ""You scream. I scream. We all scream for ice cream."" Salted Caramel and Mascarpone & Lemon Zest.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Listed in The Attraction of Austin We were really excited to have a true showdown between Dolce Neve and Lick, but alas, Dolce Neve is gelato, not ice cream.    Difference between ice cream and gelato? huffingtonpost.com/2013/…  Similar to Lick, the nice lady at Dolce Neve did not get irritated with our million requests for samples.  :)  The last sample I tried was just to humor the better half, whose favorite flavors do not typically align with my own.  Don't spread the word, but I'm glad I listened - you MUST try the pistachio - this flavor alone took the establishment from four to five stars.  It's as if they took an already scrumptious food, and made it into the very best version of itself.  Now that my appetite is bigger than it was when I was standing in the store, I wish I had also ordered one of their amazing-looking ice cream sandwiches.  I overheard someone saying that it tasted like a lemon bar...yum!  I wish I had one now.  Oh!  I almost forgot...the Chocolate with Maldon Sea Salt is to die for.  It's very similar to a premium pint from Phin & Phebes (from Brooklyn) called Dark Chocolate Salty Caramel.  If you're really into ice cream, check them out too - they're available in other states as well.  phinandphebes.com The chocolate with Maldon sea salt is spectacular",1
Coffee Shop 16,"Just found this place while trying to kill an hour waiting to pick someone up. They didn't have regular coffee, which disappointed me a little, but they have espresso drinks, so I got a latte. For their gelato, I highly recommend the Dolce Neve (the flavor with the same name as the place is usually a safe bet). It's delicious! Definitely a nice little place to kill some time and have some good gelato. They have a great selection and a decent price - I spent a little more than I expected just because they didn't have plain coffee, but it's nothing crazy.  I will definitely come back again, especially once the weather gets hotter.",1
Coffee Shop 16,Dolce Neve is the best Gelato in Austin. All the ingredients are totally natural and their flavors are soooo delicious!! Love love this wonderful little place of heaven!,1
Coffee Shop 16,WOW! Is all I can say! Soooooo good it's almost indescribable. Stopped in for a late night snack and got a 2 scoop cone of salted caramel & chocolate hazelnut. Seriously so good & the staff was really sweet too!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"It was good stuff, good texture, good size, good sweetness.  Good pistachio, good coffee, good chocolate. Oh my goodness, I have a craving for Dolce Neve! The standard flavors, with a little twist, and a lot of good ingredients put together makes this a staple for my gelato needs. It beats Lick.",1
Coffee Shop 16,Dolce Neve is just a street over from my house; I'm pretty happy I am just discovering this place now otherwise I would be at least 5 pounds heavier. I really enjoyed the Goat Cheese Pear and the Salty Caramel.  The gelato options are very unique and tasty and its a total plus that you have the option to try the different flavors before making a final decision. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. I am looking forward to my next visit.,1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins I live near Round Rock and still find myself driving down to this location to see what new flavors they have. It is a bit pricey, but that just makes me get a smaller portion and savor each bite more.  If you are an ice cream traditionalist (vanilla, chocolate, etc.), don't be scared to try the flavors here. They have free samples for all the flavors!",1

Coffee Shop 16,"It was my first visit to Dolce Neve after reading so many good reviews from people. The store is very cute, which is located on South 1st. St. in a small house. It has a small parking lot in the back which has about 5 spots. Luckily, it's a gelato shop so people move in and out quickly. The store layout is very simple. It just has a counter with flavors displayed neatly. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the worker. He offered us to try as many flavors as we want since they have pretty creative gelato flavors in the store. I tried Mascarpone with lemon, which is really good. The flavor was slightly creamy but balanced with the acidity of lemon. I tried many other creative flavors but I settled for the Mascarpone and lemon. I like how creative they are with gelato flavors. They take flavors that are not typically mixed together and experimented for a new flavor. I can see how this place has become one of the top gelato shops in Austin. I will want to come back and try more flavors next time.",1
Coffee Shop 16,"I don't know much about gelato other than the ""Paciugo's"" chain, but this place is the bomb.com and seems super authentic. I couldn't even pronounce majority of the flavors, but it was totally worth it.  I ended up getting green tea & stracciatella and the flavors were indulging.  The atmosphere is super cute, they have plenty of succulents. I like plants.  IT WAS AWESOME K BYE",1
Coffee Shop 16,Super yum! I had the dolce nerve and mango gelato which were both refreshing and tasty! Get the medium-large and don't share! ;) Service is superb and they allow you to try the flavors prior to ordering so def take advantage of that! my brother had the ice cream sandwich which neither of us liked too much. I hope they come to Houston soon!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"11 check-ins Listed in Treat yo self!, Unique Sweets Treats When we first drove into their small parking lot I thought, ""How Adorable"". What I did not expect was to have this cute store blow my freaking mind with their unexpected and delicious flavors of gelato!  I had seen them featured on Unique Sweets with their summer flavor of sweet corn and blackberry. If I remember correctly, I believe that one of the owners actually lived in Europe for a while where they crafted the art of gelato making and so generously brought it with them to Austin so that all of us could indulge in this truly special treat.  I was eyeing the honey, ricotta, and orange pistachio flavor until I was rocked out of my drooling daydream hearing the woman in front of me asking what flavor would go well with coffee when the man behind the counter said Fig and Mascarpone. Umm, do what now? I HAD to have a sample of that once it was my turn.  I watched him lift the beautiful silver dome and scoop out a heaping sample spoon. It was everything I never realized I wanted and needed in my life. Sweet, creamy, rich, tangy, mellow, and luscious. Sweet baby Jesus what trickery is used to make this heavenly goodness?! Voodoo?? Black magic? I don't care, I must have it!!!  My husband got the coffee flavor and once outside I took a spoonful of his and mixed it with mine thinking there was no way the two would taste good together. It was magic in my mouth and YES I know how that sounds! Their dedication to gelato making and using local ingredients clearly shows because the end result is nothing short of a show stopper.  The employee whom I am assuming is the owner, was personable and kind asking where we were from and how we heard about them. He was sincere when he thanked us for our business as we paid and left, asking us to please return. As if he needed to ask! I love you Dolce Neve. Marry me? My husband says he's cool with it.

This place reminds me a lot of the secret but cult favorite hole-in-the-wall gems I found in Korea...which I love!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"2 check-ins One of my favorite ice cream places in Austin for sure! It's been a while since I've had gelato i Italy, but from what I remember, this place definitely fulfills and satisfies my gelato cravings!  I got the dolce neve, pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla the last time I came here. All delicious flavors. While I wish some flavors had been kicked up a little bit, I still loved the creaminess and sweetness that each flavor delivered. My favorites are the pistachio and dolce neve by far, not only because of the lightness of the gelato itself but also because of the bright flavors! I happen to love pistachio ice cream of any variety, and this probably tops my list of pistachio favorites! I also am a sucker for anything lemon so the dolce neve (egg custard with lemon zest) definitely satisfied my lemon craving without giving me anything too mouth puckeringly sour!  An Austin favorite that I definitely will return to!",1
Coffee Shop 16,"ROTD The decor is shabby chic and gives you an old timey feeling. There are little wooden stool tables to sit at that are perfect for a couple. They have 3 sizes you can order your gelato in and depending on the size you can get up to 4 different flavors per serving. Pretty quiet music playing in the back, soothes the atmosphere. The wifi has a lock and I don't visibly see a password anywhere. It's not gigantic in here so I could expect this place is standing room only during the hot season. I'm impressed and happy to have found a froyo replacement! Gelato home",1
Coffee Shop 16,"3 check-ins Listed in desserts & sugar, frozen!, mediterranean! I've been here a lot of times, and each time has always been a pretty good experience! I love how you never come back to the same set of flavors (even if you go twice in a week), because they make their gelato in small batches and rotate flavors.  A couple of the interesting/stand-out flavors I've had:  - Cassata: I just tried the flavor this past weekend, and was pleasantly surprised. Based on a popular Italian dessert, the ricotta-flavored gelato, candied orange peels, and chocolate chunks make for a delicious combination - cheesy, chocolatey, and slightly tangy with a nice texture added by the candied orange peels!  - Blackberry & Coconut Milk: I am Filipino, so I really love all things coconut milk. I love how the blackberries added a sort of sour kick to the creaminess of the coconut milk. This was actually one of my favorite flavors that I've tried here!  - 70% Chocolate: I'm always a huge fan of all desserts that are thick, rich, and chocolatey. Although this flavor isn't exactly super novel, it's a wonderful classic.  - Mascarpone Lemon Zest: Also one of my favorites, tangy from the lemon, but with a cheesy aftertaste. One of my go-to's if I can't decide on what to choose!  They also give you really generous portions. For a $4 small, you get two heaping spoons (not scoops, because scoops imply a standard of size, I think) of gelato, and then some, unlike some other ice cream places where you pay $4 and receive two little, round, perfectly-sized scoops. (Lick, I love you, but you're holding back on me.) And, at Dolce Neve, they make the gelato in front of you, which is fun. The Italian man who started this is also great. (: I'm glad this place is doing so well!  PS: Got their icecream cookie once, and it was too hard for me too eat (like, hard as in not soft). I don't think I'll be getting that again. gelato sandwich gelato to the brim",1
Coffee Shop 16,2 check-ins This place is head and shoulders above any other gelato/coffee stop I've been. It's the gold standard as far as I'm concerned. I still think about the affogato with vanilla gelato when I'm pounding down my nespressos in the morning. And sigh because there's only one Dolce Neve and nothing here even comes close.  Place is so tastefully designed also. Probably one of my favorite places in the world (seriously).,1

Coffee Shop 16,I've been there 2 times but I tryed gelato just one time. This place is so cute and cozy! This is why I decided to go inside at the first time. Gelato is good and not too sweet. Cone is a good choice instead cup! Parking is not charged. Just few tables and seats inside but I got a table easily. Staff is friendly!! I'll be back soon to try other flavors. If you are visiting and taking pictures of the postcard mural between 1st street and Anna Street this place is a good option to grab a coffee and get a ice cream! It's pretty close there!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"Hello lovely Dolce Neve Staff,  I visited your darling little shop for the first time last evening. I was very impressed by the flavor selection, the uniqueness of the shop, and your super friendly staff. I purchased one of your egg custard ice cream sandwiches, and was super excited to try it. When I took a bite, I was honestly quite disappointed. I wasn't aware that the gelato sandwiches were made of shortbread, instead of the traditional cake batter- which would have been a delectable surprise if the shortbread hadn't been overbaked   I've been a baker for many years, and own my own pastry shop, so I can absolutely understand, more than most people, that sometimes things just get over-baked and overlooked. I also understand that artisan treats take a ton of work, and ingredients are expensive, which is why I was fine with paying $7 for this sandwich (by the time I had tipped). So I went up to one of the sweet girls manning the shop, and asked if I could switch it out for a different flavor, maybe one of the ones that wasn't so chalky and hard to swallow. She informed me that she was not allowed to do that, and if I wanted something else, I'd have to pay for it.  Judging by the reviews on your Yelp and Facebook, Dolce Neve is a very loved and established business here in Austin. I am shocked that there is not a policy in place to settle these type of matters. I know how hard your team must work to keep everything together, I just can't believe that the shop couldn't part with one little ice cream sandwich in order to make matters right.",0
Coffee Shop 16,This is a fantastic stop in South Austin if you're craving something sweet and unique. The shop has a neat vibe and the staff are very helpful and friendly - I'd recommend sampling everything!,1
Coffee Shop 16,"Best Ice cream I've had in Texas and perhaps in America (and I love ice cream). No joke it's incredible! Worth the wait. Once it was my turn I tried every flavor and took my time. My opinion is that if you wait a while in line for something then you've earned taking your time when its your turn! The staff was super friendly and if I could, I'd go back everyday and twice on Sunday!  Ten thumbs up for this place Hazelnut, Coffee, and Vanilla Bean",1
Coffee Shop 71,"After living in SF for many years, I've developed a preference for snob hipster coffee, so Thunderbird was a nice find in Austin. The vibe is mellow, quiet, with lots of working students sitting around and many open tables inside and out.

Option for soy and almond milk for our lactose intolerant friends too. I was pleased with the coffee and ambiance and would come again. Latte Iced toddy",1
Coffee Shop 71,I came a few minutes before they closed and the host happily helped me. I got a later with mocha and the chipotle chicken. The building is out but remodeled. Well done. We sat at the bar while waiting for our food. Music was ok. This would be a good place to work from your laptop if you are mobile. Only complaint is the price and parking. The double P's.

If I'm in the area and have the money and time I will come back and try the Affogato and a turkey crab sandwich Looks like a house At the bar,1
Coffee Shop 71,"Easy to spot and is located in a nice little spot. I didn't notice a sign that made it too obvious that it was the spot. Might have just missed it since it was my first time.  There is a small parking lot that can hold about 8 cars next to the shop. If you get lucky, you'll be able to get a spot. If not, you can park street. When I went in on a Saturday, the neighborhood parking was pretty packed, but you should be able to find a spot eventually.  The inside was pretty chill. It wasn't too loud either, so its a pretty good place to get some work done. There are a good number of tables  and along the walls there are some plugs, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a charge. Restroom was pretty clean, no complaints.  Coffee was pretty decent, nothing too crazy. They do have different specials every day so be sure to check that out before you get anything.  Special Attn: Don't park in the Hoover's parking lot, apparently they will tow if you are not eating in that ""plaza.""",1

Coffee Shop 71,"2 check-ins First, if you need fast wifi, don't come here during busy hours. I have been here twice: once when there were three guests total and another when it was completely full.  First time, wifi was great and it was at night and super cozy. Also, perfect level of noise (overhead music + not all the bustling noise and sound of conversation).  Second time, during early evening and many many conversations everywhere and overhead music was a lot louder. Wifi was super slow. Suuuuuuper slow.  First time, I got the iced honey nut latte. It was ok, nothing out of this world or anything.  Second time, I forgot to order it iced, but I'm so glad that I did. It's so much better as a regular latte. Smells like a box of honey nut Cheerios and it's heavenly. Every sip smelled and tasted sweet and amazing.  There are A TON of seats. So when I say it's packed, it really is packed. I count at least twelve tables for two (spaced well enough apart) and two community-like seating areas, and ample outdoor seating. And there are PLENTY of outlets.  Parking is a hit or miss. Their lot is small, but there's street parking on the other side of the building. It seems like it starts clearing out around 7 PM. Honey nut latte",1

The last couple of times my sister-in-law and her hubby came to visit, we've gone here to enjoy some espresso drinks, while playing a board game or two on their wood slab table. Even though their new paint/decor is nice, I preferred the old look. I think it's lost a some of its little house coffee shop feeling.  You can also get a free drink with the purchase of some coffee beans, which effectively brings the beans down to a reasonable grocery store level cost.",1

Well, the Honey Nut Latte at Thunderbird pretty much smells just like a freshly opened bag of Honey Nut Cheerios, and I ain't complaining. The sweetness is cut by the espresso and milk, which is perfect to sip as you get some work done.  Thunderbird has quite a bit more solo seating than other Austin coffeeshops, but personally it's a little too loud to be super productive without your own form of distraction (eg your own music). But there's outdoor seating, free wifi, tasty drinks, and friendly baristas to entice you to come back - which I'm inclined to.  As with most Austin coffee shops, parking can be a massive hassle - don't park at Hoover's, don't block any driveways, etc. You might have to park a couple blocks away and walk for a couple minutes, but baby it's worth it *insert saxophone riff here* Honey Nut Latte",1
Coffee Shop 71,"6 check-ins 3 stars for the kinda pricey coffee, but I love everything else. You must try the honey nut latte! Super flavorful and not too heavy like a lot of other lattes. Don't forget to grab a punch card!  The beers during happy hour are pretty cheap! $1 off of all beers from 4-7pm making most of them $3.50 during happy hour. The selection is typical: live oak, karbach, Austin beerworks, etc. They also have daily happy hour specials on top of the normal happy hour.  Wifi is reliable. Music is a little loud sometimes, but the baristas have good taste so it's okay. Parking is limited in their lot, but the neighborhood has plenty of spots.

It's usually busy later around lunch, but it's one of my favorite places to be at 7 in the morning. The coffee/espresso they have is also top quality. They take their drip as seriously as they take the espresso. They will even have a couple different bean choices for espresso as well, that are appreciably different from one another.  Pros: great feel, nice people, delicious coffee/espresso  Cons: expensive, but when you get what you pay for, it's 100% worth it.",1

The outside patio is great for the latter; the hanging Christmas lights make it really cute and homey.

Coffee Shop 71,"I'm conflicted about this review. It used to be one of my favorite coffee shops in all of Austin, but I've grown increasingly agitated with the establishment. I order the same drink religiously and I never deviate from it. While looking at my bank statement, I noticed that I have paid the same price 14 times for my go to drink but I have also paid different prices ranging from 3-5 dollars for the same drink 12 times. I have brought it up with the staff and they shrug it off and attribute it to the casualness of the East Side of Austin. I almost felt a bit disrespected having a white guy tell me, a Black woman, about the culture of East Austin. Maybe he was referring to its current and longstanding status of being heavily gentrified.  I prefer diversity in all spaces. Including my coffee shops. It's sad to see East Austin lose its deep Black history to overly monotone and singular coffee shops that caters to the increasing white population.  I said all of this to say that I would recommend this place for people who can go about their lives without noticing that there is only one Black person in the room or that everyone else is white like them. This place is for you if you too like to gentrify areas where deeply rooted cultures of African Americans have been established for generations. This place is for you if you are audacious enough to recreate and redefine the culture of East Austin and tell a person from there what it is. Lastly, this place is for you if you like to commodify poverty to look cool and eccentric...or of course ""hipster""  Needless to say, this will be my last visit.  Happy Gentrifying!",0
Coffee Shop 71,"4 check-ins Thunderbird certainly gives off the typical Austin coffee shop vibes, and adds a bit of personality. Inside is chic and comfortable, and there are plenty of furniture and decoration pieces to be topic of conversation, such as a tastes and aromas poster on the ceiling above the register, and quotes written on the tabletops. It is also equipped with both indoor and outside seating - a cute little yard outside that is perfect for a cool morning.  I heard great things about the honey nut latte - my boyfriend said he read endless reviews about it on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. I would say it's a really good flavor - one of the best I've tried - but it was just a bit too strong and sweet for me. I came back again and opted for just a regular unflavored latte and was much more satisfied.  I have yet to try their food - and I can't speak for their latte art because I was given my orders in to go cups. But the coffee is pretty good - not too strong of a flavor but smooth and satisfying.  The one complaint I would have is that the music is always really loud. Sure, there is a lot of seating, so you might think you can sit and get some work done, but I just can't concentrate here. Thunderbird is definitely not the quiet, calming atmosphere you may look for in a coffee shop.  Not my favorite in Austin but definitely a great place to get good espresso drinks.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"This is my go too east side spot! Great coffee and nice vibe. They also have an awesome outdoor patio space. Food is okay, I go for the coffee. Everyone talks about the honey nut latte, but I am a traditional latte kind of girl. Parking can be a bit tough, great to  bike to! :)",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Near my son's school, so we've stopped here several times. Free wifi, GREAT coffee, tacos/pastries for breakfast, sandwiches & salads for lunch/dinner. Morning rush",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Winter is coming...Yeah right! Austin's perfect weather is gracing us and there's no better place to enjoy it than Thunderbird's patio. Baristas are so nice - I always feel douchey asking for my extra shot of espresso lots of ice short on the 2% milk Latte, but they make a note on the ticket and serve it perfectly, yay! If your friends are visiting and Cenote is just too crowded, take them here - it's got that chill Austiny laidback vibe. Pro Tip: Grab some breakfast tacos from Mi Madres across the street, then come over for the after-meal espresso fix.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"This spot is right down the road.  Bennu and Cherrywood become overrun, so I thought I'd give this little neighborhood gem a try.   The guys behind the bar were so friendly and keep their smiles and conversations with the patrons going, making sure to be that bright star in a pre-coffee haze we all have.  :) If I could base my review on the folks working here alone, it would be a 5 star, hands down.   However... I ordered the macchiato; seemed simple enough to know what their capabilities are. Wow. This is the most bitter macchiato I've ever had.   My journey for a close to home coffee spot to work in continues...",0
Coffee Shop 71,"Listed in Brunch Spots Brunch Review:  Thunderbird is dabbling in having brunches on the weekends and I attended their first pop up brunch a couple Saturdays ago.  I already enjoyed this place for the fantastic coffee but, now there is more to love.    I ordered the open faced salmon toast and it was well put together.  How could anything be bad with salmon, fresh veggies and hard boiled egg?  The only critique that I would give is that the bread was a little hard around the edges and was hard to cut.  I also ordered the egg and bacon torta and wow was it huge.  The bread was hearty but fresh and the only critique I would give on this one is that I wish the egg would have been a little warmer.  The food did come out really quickly, plenty of space on the patio and points for being dog friendly, as always!  I hope they continue to do brunch and I am sure they will work out those two tiny kinks in service that I mentioned. Pop up Saturday brunch! smoked salmon toast and egg, bacon, tomato and onion torta!",1
Coffee Shop 71,"After an action-packed weekend, I was drained and phone-less. All I wanted to do was play Sleeping Beauty until I was back home.  With one hour to spare before dinner, my friend and I decided to make a stop here. The first parking lot we parked in was only for Hoover's Cooking, which was right across Thunderbird Coffee. Thunderbird Coffee and Hoover's Cooking are strict about parking. Try to find a spot along Breeze Ter.  As soon as we entered, you see how packed this place is with people studying, surfing the Internet, or socializing. Even though there were various kinds of tables and chairs with outdoor seating, seating was limited.  I ended up choosing the honey nut latte (4/5). I'm not a coffee person at all, but I am glad I read some of the Yelp reviews beforehand. It was neither too sweet nor too strong, was just the right balance! It is so much better than Starbucks, which is overloaded with sugar.  My friend spotted a cleared table with 4 outlets right next to the area they prepare food. One of the baristas was making chicken chipotle sandwiches, so the aroma was delightful. The sandwiches were prepared with salads as well. It looked like a meal from McAlister's or Panera Bread.  Most of the time I was people watching while sipping on my latte... Nice to just relax sometimes and enjoy. Overall, it has a hipster and welcoming atmosphere with friendly baristas! I would come back to try their food next time! Honey Nut Latte (Left) and Sweet Cappuccino (Right)",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Thunderbird has been one of my favorite coffee shops for years now because they execute well on the basics of a coffee shop: clean, bright, low-key, friendly staff, good drinks, plenty of seating (indoor and out), not expensive as fuck, wifi, not weird and pretentipus, plenty of bathrooms...  It's a super straightforward formula, and one that seems to elude a lot of other local coffee shops.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"I am visiting from Los Angeles and this is a great place to stop by if you are visiting Austin or live in Austin. Great customer service and great place to hang out and enjoy a nice cup of coffee, or beer if you like.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"4 check-ins Listed in a latte love One of my favorite coffee houses in all of Austin! I absolutely love Thunderbird! The coffee/espresso here is great. The baristas have all been really friendly. The atmosphere is really nice and friendly. The place is super cute and vibrant and welcoming.  There aren't a ton of seats/outlets, so that might be the biggest pain--finding somewhere to settle down. It's like war if you go at the wrong time. Outside seating is awesome, but I have never seen outlets out there, so it's kind of a hit or miss depending on what you're planning to do at the coffee shop. If you're with friends, and it's nice outside, then there's usually always outside seating available. If it's terrible weather and you want to study, good luck finding a good seat.  My favorite drink is the honey nut latte--it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Even when I ask for extra shots of espresso, it still tastes great and keeps me going for hours.  I've tried the Thai Iced Coffee--meh, not my favorite. It tastes like me trying to make coffee with sweetened condensed milk at home (my terrible attempts when I'm craving Viet Iced Coffee), which usually doesn't end so well. I've tasted better Thai Iced Coffee at actual Thai restaurants, but I guess the point here is that it's coffee and sweetened condensed milk.  The only thing I really hate is finding parking. You can park in the local neighborhood, but even then it can get crowded and be a pretty far walk. Sometimes, I get lucky with the parking lot. Other times, some person will pull in even though I've been sitting in my car with my blinker on. Parking is just the worst thing about Thunderbird.  Overall, love Thunderbird. One of my favorite places to get coffee and study! honey nut latte",1
Coffee Shop 71,Came here on a sunny afternoon to try out a new coffee shop in town. The iced vanilla latte was very delicious! The environment here was very cute and cozy. I look forward to coming back :),1
Coffee Shop 71,2 check-ins Very austin coffee shop that also serves beer and cocktails too. Nice outside area with lots of places to sit. Not great parking options so be sure to park along the street.  I recommend the honey nut latte and the breakfast burritos for breakfast or brunch. The place gets just and tables and outlets might be challenging to find.  Bring your headphones if you want to work. It gets loud.,1
Coffee Shop 71,"Updated review I forgot I'd reviewed this place kind of negatively a while back--been here several times lately and it's been good so I figured I should update. Employees are very nice and coffee/lattes are good. Never too much of a wait in the early morning. A bit expensive, but it's a treat anyway and it's nice to support a local place.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Visited Thunderbird for the first time today, Sunday mid afternoon. Parking is rough, but bearable if you just suck it up and walk. I would rec the bus or bikes if that's really an issue for you.  Inside, it's spacious and well lit. The natural lighting is wonderful and I like that you're not sitting on top of other people. There's also a lot of outdoor seating!  We ordered an iced soy chai latte and an iced honey nut latte. Pricey, yes. However, as this is not my daily morning stop for coffee, I didn't mind splurging.  The iced chai was decent. Could have been spicier, but it was good! The honey nut latte was perfect! Sweet and smooth, with light flavor. Baristas were super sweet and  service was very quick for the two drinks. We didn't order any food, but the things we saw put out looked amazing.  I can see how it would get crowded during the school year (as a college student myself, I'm not sure if I'd head here expecting a seat during finals week) but it's a perfect summer hangout.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"4 check-ins Coffee again? Yupp. I didn't think this review could happen but here we are, thanks to a girlfriend who loves coffee more than me (she has a sweater that says, ""OK, but first....COFFEE"")  This is a review that reflects the young, 23 year old male that is limited to vanilla lattes, super sweetened iced coffees and your occasionally random BLACK hot coffees.  Everyone is always talking about that honey nut latte, I tried it iced girlfriend got it hot and we both like it a lot. We came back and got a hot coffee and iced coffee and it's pretty good, ms. coffee over here says the beans are good quality.  Let's delve into places where I can help, like the location, environment, staff, and food!  Location has a bit of a small parking lot, good luck during rush hours.  Environment is comfy, pleasing, and clean with a touch of Austin. I like. Studying here is a good choice! Wifi is really good so I can play hearthstone and write Yelp reviews while she studies ;)  Staff are cool and like to talk! Go bother them if you have questions!  Food is pretty good, just normal. However they have the ""le raymond"" which I HIGHLY recommend because it's named after yours trule""  Yay, coffeehouse! One of my favorites!",1
Coffee Shop 71,This place was great! It was my first time visiting Austin and I'm so glad my boyfriend and I came across this place. The baristas were so friendly and helpful. The sandwiches tasted so fresh and the coffee was great.,1
Coffee Shop 71,"Footnotes to my terrible experience: Crappy service Employee culture is one where it's okay to be confrontational with customers and gossip about them Music is always terrible and too loud Wifi is pretty bad  Coffee is good but not good enough to make up for any of these.  I checked my bank statement and over the last 6 months coming here multiple times a week to work, I've spent $650+.  And no, that number will never go above my regretful support of the sad baristas that work here.  I've been a regular for awhile now, regular to the point where one of the baristas asked me as I walked to the bar, ""Want a double?""  This highlights the fact that I usually order the same thing every time and that many of the staff know me by face/know what I order.  Well, the other day, I was moving to a corner location to get a plug and so my laptop was on other side of the shop. No one at the register and the same barista I've ordered from countless times (wears little beanie homeless dude looking hats, scruffy looking like he's desperately trying to grow a bear yet is struggling) is at the espresso machine steaming milk.  I go to the corner and say, ""Hey can I get a double."" Then I paused as I looked at the espresso options on the little sign and say, ""The expranza please.""  Then I walk away to get my stuff so it isn't left unattended as i move to my new location nearer.  If you've yet to visualize the scene in your mind, here's the gist: I don't see the point in standing at the register and waiting for him to finish when he can get to my double anytime he can and I'll come up and pay when it's ready (as I did) so I just ask him for a double whenever he gets to it and I go get my stufff and move it to my new location. No rudeness, no impatience, just a simple double espresso request.  He gives me my drink, I pay and say thanks. He say nothing. (In retrospect, he grabs it from the side of the register and moves it to me at counter, which is not standard as they normally place drinks on ledge by espresso machine. I now wonder if my shot was compromised.)  20 minutes later, I'm working at my laptop in the corner facing the window. This barista has come to lean on the table next to me and asks me if I have a second. I take out my headphones and look up, trying to process what's going on.  He says something to the effect of, ""I've seen you be rude to other baristas, and I wanted to bring it to your attention because we don't want to encourage that kind of environment here.""  I'm a little dumbfounded, and I ask him for specific examples, which he's unable to give me any. Then I say, ""So you think how I just ordered from you was rude?""  He says, ""Yes, I thought it was very rude.""  I told him I wasn't being rude, I was just ordering a double as a regular like I do often. He told me that if I was going to ""raise my voice,"" then he would have to ask me to leave.  Of course, this is lol considering i wasn't raising my voice in the least. He must have expected me to just apologize instead of challenge his accusations.  I told him I'll be leaving and won't be coming back. He said, ""Ok.""  I sat thinking about it for a few minutes and realized that the other barista that was there this day had also been staring me down quite a few times as he walked by. I'm mean, straight up mean-mugging me. I thought it was odd but just assumed that was his natural demeanor or something.  Then I realized that they must have been gossiping about me and that's why now my innocuous request for a double was construed as ""very rude.""  Now, I know that testimony of a he said/she said exchange is rarely accurate. You might assume I was rude or curt with him. I assure you I was not. In fact, I've never been rude or short or curt with any of the staff there even though they've grown increasing unfriendly the more I've been a patron, most of whcih has been recently because I'm assuming someone said something and they all gossiped to each other about it (the way places like this do, especially places like this full of hipster chain-smoking douchers).  The fact that he came from behind the counter to interrupt me to tell me how i ordered was rude was unprofessional and boarderline scrap worthy. They lost a customer for life, one that had redeemed at least 8+, likely more, of those free drink cards (buy 8 and get one free).  Perhaps these baristas should get their heads out of their asses and realize that their job is to serve the customer not expect the customers to serve them.  The owner needs to come in and manage these employees. My advice as a business owner is to focus on the culture and set some standards for greeting and interacting with customers.  My advice as a customer is to fire this twerp and make sure none of your other employees think it's okay to confront customers, especially over something as trivial as, ""a rude order.""  And to that barista, grow a set and be a man instead of a sensitive silly nancy.",0
Coffee Shop 71,"I've been here a few times and not impressed. I believe the staff is over caffeinated (too much caffeine). Ordered a machiatto and instead of a dapple of foam I received more milk than espresso in my drink. I thought it was just an accident, but happened again.  Great place to hang out, poor service and lack of knowledge about coffee. If you lack knowledge about coffee, this place is for you",0
Coffee Shop 71,"Oh my goodness, hipster hate central y'all!  A little fun is okay (joshing), but these are still people making your coffee. And lucky for you hipsters know good coffee! You know who also likes this place? My 63-year-old conservative retired military father. He raved about Thunderbird. Apparently he is also immune to the hipster culture and just likes good service. We went with him the first time in Austin and we liked it! There's seating outside with PLENTY of sunshine and we always get exactly what we ordered. Service is good. No sugar free flavors, but that's frowned upon at many establishments, so I've learned to ask for a drink with 50 grams of sugar that apparently won't kill me instead. (sarcasm)The irony!",1
Coffee Shop 71,Austin's coffee scene is killing it. Trendy place with local art on the wall. Lots of space to do work.  Came here with a fellow yelp elite early in the morning -not much of a wait. I ordered the Honey Nut Latte and my friend ordered the cappuccino. Both of which were great. Prices seem typical. I liked the baristas and their food menu also looked pretty bomb ( I guess breakfast tacos everywhere is a thing)!  Highly recommended for you coffee fiends visiting Austin *keep it weird*!,1
Coffee Shop 71,"My review is based solely on what's in the cup. The atmosphere and service are great, no complaints there. However, the espresso is serious 3rd-wave medium-roast: fruity, pungent, wild. I just can't get into it. I like dark roasts, and blends especially. If you learned to love coffee in the European style -- dark, caramel, rich, even smoky -- you won't like Thunderbird. The cold-brew is too weak for me to really evaluate. It seemed a bit more passable to me if only it were stronger.",0

Coffee Shop 71,"I spent a lovely hour in Thunderbird this morning. When I got there at 9, there was only one lady in line ahead of me and about 5 people in the shop. Five minutes later, the line was out the door and it was busy for the rest of my stay. Talk about perfect timing...this place is popular!  The baristas are oh-so-friendly here and really know their stuff. The lady ordering her coffee ahead of me took about 4 minutes to decide on a bean. I didn't mind - the information I picked up while eavesdropping on that discussion was so educational. They use top-quality products here and the cappuccino I enjoyed was superb.  There's a lot of seating in this shop, but they do a great job of not cramming every space with a chair. The patio outside looked nice for a sunny day. If you find yourself waiting for a spot, just engage the cool baristas in conversation, savor your coffee, and enjoy people watching!",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Atmosphere = 5 stars Coffee was good. I do wish they had pumpkin flavored syrup, especially since its fall. Staff was friendly! Theres seating everywhere including outside on such a wonderful day!",1

Coffee Shop 71,"The music is a tad loud for a coffee shop -- which doesn't serve the ambience well. Very cute place. It would be nice for it to be a bit more subdued. There are lots of acoustics...so it can be painful to listen to, especially if you're not into the music they are playing.  Nice covered outside area. Spacious inside. Parking is okay. Fine coffee. Lots of outlets. Lots of light. Prefer this place for hanging out and not for being on my computer or reading or relaxing...but that's me.",1

The line wasn't bad and the coffee didn't take long to get. I opted for the honey nut latte with soy because I was kind of feeling something different than my regular black coffee and milk...poor choice on my part since the latte was so sweet. I'd gladly go back and try the regular brew though, the shop is cute and the servers were really friendly. My only qualm is it'd be nice to know how much drinks cost since the board didn't list any prices. Other than that, Thunderbird is a swell place and I would love to spend some real time here.",1

I was especially impressed with how my bagel dog was prepared. Rockstar no longer carries them, and when they do it's usually just thrown in a bag and handed to you. But thunderbird cut it open, warmed it on a grill, and spiced some mustard for me. Definitely above and beyond my expectation!",1

Coffee Shop 71,"Awesome place! The parking sucks, but it keeps the place from getting over filled. But once you are in the food is awesome and the drinks are great!

Coffee Shop 71,"This place rocks! Every sandwich I've had is fantastic, as is the pumpkin/carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. And the key lime pie. And the vegan chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies.  Dude man.  The cookie game is strong here.  Pro tip: They get deliveries of fresh cookies on Thursday nights around 9PM. They're warm, fresh, and amazing.  Also, their grilled cheese.  Just do it.  They add cinnamon to their chocolate milk. Worth it.  Uhm.  They're amazing.  Nuf said.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"My friend and I were looking a great coffee shop to have some coffee and digest our dinner food babies. What a pleasant surprise this was.  Drinks: I ordered the Honey-nut Latte, while my friend ordered the Chai Tea. The latter was simply alright. I am not a fan of chai tea, so take my opinion on the tea with at least 10 grains of salt. It was definitely not unbearable, but it is also most definitely not the reason I gave this place 5 stars. My Honey-nut Latte was really really good. Not too sweet, but also a good amount of flavoring that made the drink ideal for a great coffee. Order the Honey-nut Latte when you go.  Service: The cashier was very nice and patient while we were discussing our drink choices. She made the coffees right away.  Environment: This place gave me the impression that I was truly in Austin when I walked in. The coffee shop layout was very open with lots of space. The walls all had stuff on them, while a lot of the furniture was wooden. The interior designing of the place had a very Austin-y vibe (for lack of a better word). One thing I really liked about this place were the quotes scribbled on little pieces of paper that were taped to the table. As messy as that sounds, it actually contributed to the overall vibe, while also providing my friend a very intriguing topic of conversation. The quote on our table was ""Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity"" and since I was there with a friend, it was a great conversation starter.  Thunderbird Coffee is perfect for a great conversation over coffee. I paid $8.60 for two drinks. It's on the pricier side, but add in the wonderful environment, and you got yourself a deal.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Great spot to stop in and grab a cup of coffee! I was visiting from out of town, but I'll make a point to stop back in next time I'm in Austin. So many options out there these days, but these guys are at the top of my list. Plenty of room to sit down and get some work done if you're looking for that as well.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"5 check-ins The best thing about this place is the people-watching. Thunderbird attracts the best people. It's what makes this place uniquely fun and lovable. The people that come here give Thunderbird an earthy, genuine vibe. Nobody hides their tattoos. Nobody whispers when discussing intensely personal matters. Nobody casts you a wild eye because you wearing a sleeveless tuxedo shirt. People feel welcomed here, and it gives Thunderbird a certain charm.  You see every type of person here, and every person brings something interesting to the table. Musicians, bicyclists, students, yuppies, and sometimes parents and their kids. People even bring their dogs to sit outside (they have great outdoor seating). This place is a more genuine Austin locale than anywhere I've been.  Not only does it have a great atmosphere, but they've got what you need. They have a surprising amount of variety on their menu. The drinks are great. I love getting tea here, actually. I'm no coffee or tea snob, but I can say I haven't had a drink I didn't enjoy. The sandwiches rock--I always get the Chicken Chipotle sandwich. It has a nice little kick to it. Also, you know what this place does differently? They actually give you a complete meal. The sandwich comes out hot, and the side salad actually has fresh vegetables and a decent dressing. I've been to a bunch of coffee shops and gotten food when I could, and this place actually satisfies me.  And so I keep coming back. You might too.",1

Every time I've come for a cup of coffee, the barrista and anyone else behind the counter talks to me and we always have funny conversations that really start my day off right.  The music is usually really good here, the outdoor patio space it awesome and a great place to people watch, and the coffee is solid.  There are tons of options for coffee on the east side. Thunderbird is a perfect spot with plenty of room to do a little work, or maybe meet that Saturday Morning Caffeine Cruise group!",1
Coffee Shop 71,"My wife loves the Honey Nut Latte here. I had a large iced latte and it honestly didn't taste much different in terms of flavor from a Starbucks iced latte. The food is pretty good here but the prices for the coffees are high considering the available sizes.

I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a really good sandwich.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"36 check-ins I get my Cuvee coffee fix here at least twice a week (sometime 3, 4, 5 times). I work from home, so T-bird becomes my office sometimes when I need to get out.  I've NEVER had a bad service experience here -- I don't know why other people keep mentioning that.  The baristas that works here are always super friendly and attentive, even when the place is busy.  My boyfriend and I've often discussed how awesome and upbeat every single barista is, even when it's 8:30am and they're slammed and they have to walk me through my half-awake glazed confusion over what I'm trying to order.  Just needed to throw in my two cents before the haters give this location some kind of ""rude hipsters"" reputation.    The place is set-up well to hold a lot of people on their laptops, and there are a TON of outlets. Outside picnic tables are also nice with great shade & rain cover (I've totally continued working on my laptop at a picnic table while it was raining.)  Long bike rack; never had trouble finding a place.  They serve QUACKS pastries, which are the best pastries in town; only Easy Tiger comes close to as good. Sandwiches are delicious, though I wish they had a veggie sandwich. Coffee is always piping hot, and all the espresso drinks I've had were delicious (Disclaimer: I don't like Starbucks-style super sugary coffee drinks.)  Only negatives here are it gets crowded with laptop campers, and thus the wireless starts getting shaky as more people get on it.  Also, they inevitably run out of breakfast tacos very quickly in the morning.  But I can't really blame T-bird for being so awesome that everyone wants to hang out there.",1

Love the water right next to the bar (always hydrate before caffeine). Really the only downside I can think of is parking (which has only been an issue twice) and the volume of people (I am always able to work for at least two hours undisturbed).  I havent even mentioned the beer menu.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Daylight! Windows! Why are these so hard to find in Austin coffee shops?  Basically, I come to this Thunderbird location because of all the windows. It's nice to work and still feel connected to the passing of the sun and other general weather patterns. A man cave I do not want.  But beyond the windows, Thunderbird has good coffee, friendly baristas who actually want to talk to you about stuff, and respectful customers. They serve beer here in addition to coffee, so you get a mix of people hanging out, generally outside on the picnic benches, and people working on computers. It's a pretty chill vibe, so I've never been bothered by loud drunkards or louder study groups.  For the moment, this is my favorite coffee shop in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 71,Amazing coffee/cappuccino with great ambiance and outside seating make it a great place to be!,1
Coffee Shop 71,"I arrived at around 6PM on a Thursday and it was pretty crowded. I'm not sure how generally busy this place gets but finding parking was awful and confusing (granted it was heavy traffic hour).  The atmosphere is not much different from Bennu Coffee. Lots of college students on their laptops. Music a little bit too loud. If you're looking for a quiet little nook to study or do work, I would not suggest coming here. This place has a friendly, upbeat atmosphere and the staff was very nice. Good place to hang out, people watch, and chat with friends if you like a lively vibe. There's plenty of seating if you include the spots outside, but since the weather is getting a bit chilly and yucky I doubt a lot of people would want to sit outside. Otherwise, I can imagine indoors feeling rather cozy or cramped depending on how many people are here.  I will definitely be back, though, for their super delicious Honey-nut latte if nothing else!",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Good coffee. Most of the staff was cool too but there are these 2 guys in their early 20s that you can tell are good friends because they dress EXACTLY the same. They were dressed like hipsters. They both had these hats on w/ their hair coming out the bottom of the hat in a pretentious way. Here's the thing, I don't give a crap about ppl and how they dress but a store's employees are a statement of the store and though the owner encouraging independence is cool, there has to be a cutoff because these two banal trendy wannabe scene hipsters (WHO WANTS TO BE A HIPSTER?!) are giving this great coffee place a reputation that is unprofessional. You can still be considered ""laid back"" and be professional. But my coffee baristas wearing beanies in Texas says LAME. But their benevolence makes up for the mtv poser look. Maybe I'm being a bit hard on them but trust me, older people looking to work on their computers and get coffee don't wanna see these young hipster uniformed kids. They should distinguish the place by being different.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Listed in Hipster Coffee Shops A haiku to sum up my experience:  Super cute porch thing. My mocha is bland as fuck. See you soon, Epoch.",0
Coffee Shop 71,"28 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost Thunderbird's a nice shop. It has a bright and warm interior due to the (mostly natural) lighting with sleek and simple furniture. From my experience, the noise level's just right, both in music and in others conversing. The coffee's good, and they're one of the few in Austin providing Cuvee. I will say that the pretentious level is a bit higher here than other shops, but don't get too turned off by that.  The biggest problem with Thunderbird is the seating and parking. When this place is busy, it's nearly impossible to find a seat. There's a good amount of spots at the bar, but when those are gone, you're done, especially if you're in need of an outlet. I don't mind sitting outside, but Thunderbird is NOT the place to come if the weather isn't accommodating.  Otherwise, Thunderbird's a solid choice for both caffeine and studying. The simple, warm atmosphere provides a conducive environment to get things done.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"2 check-ins This is my 2nd time here. I stop by to get a cup of joe and a bite to eat before I headed to my interview. The staff is friendly, their fast and there is plenty of seating to accommodate anyone who wants to work on their laptop.",1
Coffee Shop 71,Updated review 10 check-ins I just wanted to add that I come here at random times throughout the day/night (I live close and I work third shift so I always need caffeine) with that said anytime I've come (including close to closing) I have always had a great customer service experience even though I'm just grabbing coffee to go. So I really appreciate that even though I probably spend less than ten minutes at the coffee shop the staff is still welcoming and friendly!,1
Coffee Shop 71,"2 check-ins I LOVEEEE all the windows and natural light in this coffee shop!  Plus it's a great location and has a decent amount of sitting inside and out!  It's definitely not one of those dark, computer-filled, cords everywhere, students gloomily studying, and moody coffee shops.  I went on a saturday afternoon to get some reading done and was able to find a comfy chair quite easily.  During my 2 hours there, there was always some sitting available.  There's also the perfect amount of noise level.  Pleasant music in the background and just enough people talking, that you don't feel like you're disturbing anyone else if you're having a conversation, but also not so quiet that you feel like you're sharing your life with the entire coffee shop!",1
Coffee Shop 71,"Really liked this place -- definitely see myself coming back again. I'm not a coffee connoisseur or anything, but their cappuccino is the best I've had in a while. I love that they have multiple entrances, along with gigantic windows. Good place to spend all day at without bearing the guilt that you're wasting away the free sunlight! Their windows make it possible to be productive and enjoy a pretty day when it's not possible to sit outside. They've got a decent sized patio space--which I'm quite excited about come April or the early summertime.  The service was quick, and the staff seems to be active in keeping the place clean which is a plus! They seemed very friendly and welcoming so no complaints there.  Parking wasn't bad at all. The guy before me took the last spot in their lot so I resorted to street parking but it didn't take long. Was able to find a really good spot in no time.  Now, for the two reasons that knocked off the fifth star that I would've given them:  1) the music was really loud at times (most of the time). I was there to converse and it was really hard to hear myself, let alone my company.  2) at 7pm on a Sunday, there was limited seatings. I wish they would add a few more tables or chairs. Plus, I think I witnessed a lighter than usual crowd since it is the Sunday before spring break ends.  This was my first non-Starbucks coffee house visit in Austin. I'll be exploring other locations and will be comparing them to this. So far, I like Thunderbird a lot cause I don't feel the heavy presence of the elitist hipster culture here.",1
Coffee Shop 71,"This is actually my favorite coffee shop. So, about the drinks...the honey nut latte is my favorite for when I want something sweet. They make a good iced toddy as well. Their chai is delicious, too. I eat here a lot, because I study here all the time. My favorite things are the greek salad, hummus & grilled pita, and the turkey cran sandwich. They're all yummy. Now, the baristas. I have so much love for so many of them. They're friendly, helpful, not pretentious, and accommodating. They choose the music that is played, which is really nice because I don't get sick of the music like I do at most cafes. It's homey, and I can almost always find a table inside. When the weather's nice, I sit outside with our puppy, drink an ICED honey nut latte (seriously, so good), and just get work done. The place is conducive to both studying and conversation. Oh, and check out the quotes written on each table. I have one specific quote that I LOVE. AND they have $1 mimosas on Saturdays...AND I found a new beer I like (I'm very picky) because it was on draft, so that's cool, too.  I do wish that it were open until later, because I could easily see myself staying here for an even longer haul of studying.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"4.5. Come here regularly, glad to see business is picking up! Staff is always on their game, great iced coffee, good seating options, and definitelyl convenient.  I have to agree with some of the posters that the drip coffee needs to get better (at least the dark roast does), especially as the weather cools down and iced coffee will no longer be an option!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Big open space and some good coffee. Come here to get some work done. Right now. I'm behind you.  Parking would seem impossible but you can park in the retail space on the south side of that unit. Or normal congress street parking,1
Coffee Shop 3,+Great espresso -Drip coffee was okay +Lots of non dairy milk choices -Very few gluten free options,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Dropped in for an afternoon coffee with friends. The shop is super hip and clean. Really enjoyed the iced coffee. It was bold but smooth.  They have tons of beer, great coffee, pastries, and fresh, raw juices! They juiced the fresh veggies right in front of us, and it tasted great!  Highly recommend dropping by if you want some coffee, juice, or beer! Great one-stop shop! Super hip and cool! Huge scones!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Loved the vibe in Apanas! Great place to relax and have a beer or coffee. They have games to play and the food is also delicious. Totally recommend the place.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"I was downtown for ACL Live at Threadgill's and parked a couple of blocks away, across from Apanas. I went inside to get a quick bite to eat, and noticed this shop is very new (I've been to the one in North Austin at The Domain). This is a very nice coffee shop with ample seating and I noticed some working there as well. I wanted to share a review and encourage those visiting downtown for #ACLFest, #SXSW or Austin Convention Center conferences to stop by. It is located across the street from the Chevron station at the corner of Riverside and Congress, up the hill just a block or so on the left. Easy to get to!",1
Coffee Shop 3,"This is an AMAZING coffee shop!! The pumpkin latte and blueberry scone were so delicious, and the owner Aamil was so friendly and poured my latte himself. The atmosphere is clean but fun, and I love the murals. The music was great. Great hang out spot. See all photos from Sari I. for Apanas Coffee & Beer",1
Coffee Shop 3,"Awesome new coffee shop on South Congress! The space is large, bright, and airy. Generally quiet, so it's the perfect study space. In addition to the 2-top tables that are great for getting work done, there are also three large, family-style tables and a long bar-top, so Apanas is also ideal for groups or dates. The staff are friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. The coffee itself is sourced directly from Nicaragua, where the owner himself traveled and hand-picked the beans. They also offer a selection of cold-pressed juices, craft beers, pastries, and meal items.  The food and drink are top notch quality. The staff are wonderful. If you're looking for a quiet and open coffeeshop to study, a small meeting place, or an unassuming beer, this is your place!",1
Coffee Shop 3,Loved this place! We stayed around the corner so ended up passing by to and from our hotel. These guys were so nice. Great beer. Great coffee. Very friendly and definitely a place we will come back to next time we're in Austin.,1
Coffee Shop 3,Stopped in for a quick pit stop to get out of the heat. Found out Apanas had only just opened. The staff was so friendly and nice. Great humor and indulged us in some conversation. Selection of beers is great. Coffee is good. Appreciate all the non-dairy milks on offer. Highly recommend!,1
Coffee Shop 3,What an awesome little cafe and beer bar! Aamil the owner and Tony the beer manager were so friendly! And the tap list was on point !!,1
Coffee Shop 3,"Apanas is definitely my favorite coffee in the north Austin area. Best drips in town! Mix that with great beer, sandwiches, fresh juices and great people, you get Apanas. Now it's in S Austin! Perfection.",1
Coffee Shop 3,"My family came here for afternoon drinks. The environment was very friendly and the service was wonderful.  The bartender was. Wet knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap. The noise level was pleasant, with the exception of some odd music choices. It seems to be a great place to go for a beer if you want to be able to hear each other talk.",1
Coffee Shop 3,Good selection of local Austin area craft beers and coffee drinks. The location is brand new so everything is very clean and modern. Staff was friendly and helpful as well.,1
Coffee Shop 3,"The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. I just had a latte on my way to a meeting, but this would be a great place to do some work. They also have several local drafts on tap.",1

Coffee Shop 3,First to Review We've enjoyed the Domain location.  Excited it's coming to SoCo!!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I was craving smores all day and finally decided to come here with my boyfriend before we began an entire night of studying.  The atmosphere is a great place for a date as it has a very cozy and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The smores were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are paying for the experience. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and snacks. Fast wifi was also a plus here for us.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in ATX The vibe in here is good, but  a place that still sells cigarettes deserves a couple of stars knocked off, but my lower star review isn't just for that reason.  I visited at 7 pm on a Saturday night and we waited at the bar for five minutes while bartenders just ignored us despite not being busy. The seating is comfortable and appreciated, but either people are supposed to bus their own tables but there's no signage around that, or the staff who again, wasn't busy, didn't bother to bus them and everyone instead had to sit down with other people's trash on the tables.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"This is based on experiencing multiple sides of Halcyon, the coffee and the cigar experiences.  The coffee was a decent experience, but still underwhelming when compared to other options close by. I tried both a macchiato and an americano. The macchiato would be more accurately described as a dry cappuccino. I should have known I was in for a lackluster experience when I asked for a ceramic demitasse and was told I would get it in a to go cup. The quality of the espresso extraction was also lacking with an off flavor that makes me think it was pulled a little on the short side and they tried to cover it up with extra foam. The Americano suffered a similar issue as the macchiato with the espresso flavors. It was drinkable, but definitely not something to order again. If I end up here again, I'll definitely avoid espresso based drinks.  The cigar experience was probably the biggest letdown. The humidor was adequate although quite small with a very limited selection but it was a decent selection so nothing wrong there. My complaint comes from their pricing ($13 for an Arturo Fuente Short Story) coupled with their solution for lighting the cigars - paper matchbooks. I'm glad I carry a cigar punch on my keychain because I'm a little worried how the stick would have been cut otherwise. I'm guessing that cigars definitely aren't a big part of their business, but at least having 1 proper butane lighter available should be a necessity for anyone trying to sell cigars so that matches can be avoided. If I'm expected to bring my own lighter, I might as well just bring my own cigar as well.  In general I definitely wasn't impressed by any part of my visit. I may give them another try at some point in the future, but it definitely won't include another trip to the humidor.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Heard good things about Halcyon, so I was glad I was able to stop in for some coffee one morning last week. The Thai iced coffee caught my eye so I ordered it. It was delicious! Very rich flavor and extremely satisfying, especially on a scorching hot day. I only wish Halcyon were closer to me so that I could have the Thai iced coffee whenever I want. The coffee shop also has an interesting, and very comfortable, atmosphere.  Taste | 5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4.5",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 4 check-ins So, I popped out of the relationship I was in when I first wrote my review. And since that delegation have been back to Halcyon numerous times.  Pleased to report that my love of this place was not tainted by the rose colored glasses of my former relationship.  Yes, seating here is going to suck. It's hit or miss when you come in. But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.  Love this place. The employees are awesome, the bathrooms are clean, and just remember....be aggressive when you see a seat free up!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Consistently disappointing. I'm speaking about the service, not the food or the quality of coffee (though both are rather mediocre). I can think of very few instances where a barista or bartender or server has been outright cruel to my face. Sadly, the tall dark-haired male behind the bar tonight was really truly... a jerk.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Nice bright, modern bar and cafe located in downtown Austin.  I came for breakfast and ordered the Overnight French Toast with a Cappuccino. I was a bit confused that despite being ""eat in"" my cappuccino was made as to-go. But it was alright. The french toast isn't your traditional french toast, it's actually pretty dense...more like a bread pudding construction. But it was still very good, I actually enjoyed the more dense, cakey texture.  All in all, it was a good breakfast. There's no rush on the tables and the atmosphere is just fun and lively! French toast Panoramic",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The food here was delicious. They have a beautiful selection and the location is open and comfortable. I arrived for breakfast and got a cream cheese bagel with salmon! Yum! The coffee was A-OK and... Jeez... What a beautiful selection of drinks and food. Such variety! This is a great place to come during your morning work routine, or for a date, or for a reunion with an old friend! Yay!  Why didn't I give it five stars!? They were filming a movie! And, no, it wasn't cool. It was bothersome and it seemed to make the service... Less attentive. I know this may seem like a grumpy review, like, darn you kids and your fancy Polaroid cameras!!! But it really was annoying. The cashier wasn't the most polite guy. I didn't know you were supposed to order up front first (you order up front first!). And he kinda treated me like I was an idiot. It was not welcoming... It was more like, ""oh you DON'T come here all the time?! Well allow me to make you feel like a lesser person."" Yuck. If I wanted judgment I'd go to Burger King and order a pizza. Filming a movie! Set in a restaurant?! I bet it's thrilling!!! (Sarcasm) Yum!!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins Halcyon is like that sweet spot coffee joint, you know?  Like you have to go when you're in the area even if you don't want coffee at the time.  And if you don't want coffee you can have adult beverages, (there's a nice long bar), buy cigarettes ( I don't smoke but they have a huge wall of packs) buy cigars, (they have a humidor room!!!)and even delicious desserts. Like the smores- which is a must, they give you a little gas flame thing and you can melt your own marshmallows. Great Austin-y joint if you want to take your out of town friends...great place to chat and even to work. inside and outside seating. Parking is...well, whatever you can find! Vanilla latte Humidor room.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Ordered a $4 egg panini and a $2.50 cup of coffee. When I checked my credit card statement, they had charged me $9.74. No idea what happened there.  Brusque service at the counter. Not many food options.  Coffee was good. Egg panini was ok, but needed more sauce of some kind on it. Interior space was very Austinish with a variety of places to sit.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Weird service and one of the guys had really off social queues for customer service. When you approach a counter you expect the person serving to ask how they can help, or what they can get for you, or how it's going, etc - But he just kinda stared at me waiting for me to say something. Seems like a lot of kids come to hang out here. The s'mores seem like a cool deal but in the end you get basically two s'mores sandwiches if you're sharing and it's nothing special, the novelty of making your own s'mores in a coffee shop wears off quickly. They forgot two of our drinks because one of their bartenders basically just walked away so I had to ask for it. Didn't really eat anything else, but I'm sure they have other cool stuff to eat. I'm okay with modern coffee shops and it seemed pretty Austin-y but this place just didn't vibe with me that well.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"I have tried Halcyon a few times and have consistently had a good experience. The s'mores (what they are known for) are fun but a little overpriced for what you get. During my most recent stop here, the graham crackers were slightly stale. I also wish the marshmallows were a little bigger!  Now for the good. This place has an incredibly mellow/relaxing vibe. It is great for people watching or just stopping in for a drink/coffee. I have not tried their alcoholic drinks, but their coffee is delicious! The customer service here is solid, and it usually isn't too crowded to find seating.",1
Coffee Shop 29,I loved how friendly the staff were here! And it's awesome for people watching and chilling out. The prosciutto Flatbread was delicious! Funky wall at art at Halcyon,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Came for some Sunday s'mores and coffee. I got the Guatemala pour over which was strong, and delicious. Nice seating areas. There were lots of younger couples/students here. Not a problem, just an observation. The s'mores were a fun experience. Definitely worth bringing a friend here if they are visiting to have a cup of coffee and a catch up chat before going about your day. 4 stars though because other chocolate options would have been appreciated. I know Hershey's are original, but the choice would have been nice.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Pretty neat spot for late night coffee/beer/dessert downtown. I came on a Monday night and they were still hopping in the late night at around 11pm. It was world music night and about 10 different people came to jam out on an array of different instruments, playing music from India, the Middle East, Spain, etc. Everyone together. They were great and people in the audience started dancing. Totally unexpected and totally an element of why Austin is so amazing to create spaces for this to happen and in such unexpected places.  Had a great time. Nice folks at the bar.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"This spot is literally perfection - smack dab in otherwise dirty downtown. A modern interior with tons of intimate couch seating, or traditional bar type seating if you prefer. This place is the perfect pitstop. We arrived here on Friday night and ordered drinks and 'smores. I love the coffee meets dessert meets drinks aspect here, it's refreshing compared to the rest of the dirty 6.  The only thing that's a bit gross is the fact that their restaurant is open to the public and we saw the most random people walk in and use their bathroom which kinda marred the vibe a bit.  Otherwise, I love everything about this place - I'm sure it makes for the perfect daytime brunch and coffee spot as well! A must-visit if you're in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"What a cute place!  I heard so many good things about their s'mores, and I was in such a s'mores kick so I had to try it out.  I can't say it worked perfectly, and made my marshmallows nice and crisp and gooey on the inside, but It tasted fine!    Their coffee is also very delicious.  I love Austin coffee anyways.  Their beans are so aromatically wonderful.  Great place to go to with a group, or even alone!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Great place - definitely hand pour coffee - if you don't like black you must try this one black no sugar no creamer etc. was a fun chic place to hang out at.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"A friend recommended that I try Halcyon while I was in Austin and I'm so glad I did! My barista was actually from the same town I am, which was absolutely insane to me because it's over 500 miles away! This coffee shop is in a great location and not too far from anything! I ordered an iced latte and my husband got a chocolate frappe and both were excellent! Halcyon has a full bar, so you can add a shot to any drink you purchase. The ambience is awesome, and there is a ton of comfy seating. Their art is mostly from local artists and right now they have huge glitter paintings of celebrities and I almost emptied out my savings account for one of them, but you can't exactly fit a 40x50 canvas in a carry-on bag.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List This is my go to when I am late night raving on 4th.  It can be a bit packed, the baristas a bit pretentious, and the wait time a bit too long...but you are in downtown ATX, kiddo and you gotta learn that this is the norm somewhere so it might as well be where they have ""DIY s'mores"" and killer Thai Iced Tea (w/a shot of espresso, it is DIVINE!) and is one of the better ""after all the bars close"" people watching perches!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"A date night place if I've ever seen one before. It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.  Well, that minor detail aside, I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire.",1
Coffee Shop 29,Very nice a clean setup. Food was very good for a light breakfast. The French toast was just as good as mother made. Great morning breakfast in Texas.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been coming to Halcyon for years, every trip I take to Austin. I've always been a fan of the cute and cozy furniture, the fact that they have alcohol, food AND coffee, and that the atmosphere was chill.  But this last visit was all kinds of disappointing. I would love to blame it on the fact that I was extremely hungover, but I was the only one that was and everyone else was pretty bummed out by the time we left.  We walked in as a group of 6 girls. We ordered individually, food and drinks. It took 20 minutes for the first girl's food to come out. It was just a sandwich. Then another 20 for the next plate. By that time the first girl had finished eating. 10 minutes later, two other plates came out. Followed by two more, another 10 minutes later. It was a ridiculous amount of time for extremely easy food to prepare.  On top of that, the food was inconsistent. My side salad didn't have a dressing, but two other girls' did. Two people ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, but they looked different. One was missing what looked like a sundried tomatoe type of sauce. The food tasted mediocre, at best. At least it was something in our stomachs. But the most laughable thing was the egg panini with sausage. I posted a picture. Literally one sausage patty cut in half, for the entire sandwich. We were so done with the whole experience that we just laughed it off.  There are so many other local coffee shops in Austin that likely won't be returning to Halcyon for a while.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is a really nice place if you're looking for an edgier place to chill with some friends on a late night for coffee or dessert.  It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit pricey here, but I do like the environment here, and the fact that it's open quite late.  The chocolate cake is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of snacks. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For people just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get dessert, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go. But if you're already downtown, or live in Austin, definitely check it out.",1

What really makes Halcyon great though is their wonderful staff. Just a great bunch of people that are super friendly and make everyone feel welcome. Caffeine junkies should ask for the Quad Latte. Also, the breakfast tacos are fantastic. Excellent place to day drink as well for those so inclined.  Great place for tourists to get their bearings on a visit since you're in the warehouse district and close to Congress and Sixth. My personal favorite of the many downtown coffee shops.",1

Coffee Shop 29,"3 check-ins The Good: This place is pretty consistent in everything it offers. Good coffee, vibe, people, service, etc. It's not you're usual coffee shop.

The Bad: as in most dt locations if you're looking for a work-place or a stop-and-go coffee this is not a easy place to stop at, unless you live downtown. Parking around this area is not easy, but not impossible.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've only been to Halcyon a few times in the company of friends who knew some of the bartenders/baristas. Based on those experiences, service and the price of our cocktails was quite reasonable. Absurdly reasonable.  Nepotism aside, I really enjoy the environment at Halcyon and the enormous selection of drinks they offer. It's hard to beat sitting outside on a pleasant fall day and people watching. I've never gotten the S'Mores before, but it definitely looks like quite a fun thing to do and would be perfect for a date.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Coffee was great - had an iced latte with an add shot and coconut milk. Very satisfying for that coffee craving. Place also serves food, alcohol and cigars. Bathrooms were clean, too.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Hipster coffee house, spirits and smokes. Had to check it out.  We had lunch here and went the boring route of just getting PG versions of the coffee. Although the espresso martini was tempting me.  The soy latte was very nice. My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For lunch, I had the walnut apple salad. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with bacon, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for lunch. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"". I need to come back and try one of these espresso drinks. A soy vanilla latte The apple walnut salad - very yummy! See all photos from Suann G. for Halcyon",1
Coffee Shop 29,"This place was good, but not great. The positive was the location, they had a lot of seating and the outdoor seating is great for watching people and traffic. I ordered the turkey Brie sandwhich. The salad was good, the greens were very fresh. The sandwich was good...but not great. I am a huge Brie fan and I couldn't even taste it. But for a lunch sandwich, it was good. Make sure you have time to wait though, it was about 20 minutes!!!! The place was extremely busy starting around noon. We didn't try the coffee, we went around the corner to caffe Medici!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Amazing lemon drop martini. Wonderful vibe. I am not a big fan of the food, but I still have to try the smores :)",1
Coffee Shop 29,Would have been a cool place but the bartender poured absolute vodka instead of grey goose then tried to hide it. SMH.,0
Coffee Shop 29,"PERFECT DATE PLACE!  This is my go-to place for a date and I definitely recommend. We always order the s'mores and it is so much fun. They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows, hershey bars, and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The atmosphere is super chill. I've been when they've had a live musician. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and tables and tallboys. It's across from all the gay bars and next door to Cedar Street Courtyard which are both fun spots to check out after you enjoy your s'mores.",1
Coffee Shop 29,Not sure why I made such a big mistake by not ordering the s'mores but I think I need to come back and try it.  Came here to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was decently packed but nothing to crazy.  I ordered the Iced Latte and sat down for a couple hours to do some work.  The wifi was nothing to crazy but it did the job.  The overall environment in Halcyon was really nice.  Not too loud but not library silent.  I would highly recommend this place for a ice quite place to work or talk to some friends.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"19 check-ins Ahhh Halcyon. This place is a classic and is definitely a place I'd recommend you checking out, especially if you're visiting Austin. Whether it's during the day or at night post-club/post-bar, this place never disappoints.  The s'mores and drinks are amazing here. I highly recommend you try the espresso martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available. Of course if you come at night, especially during the weekend, it may be a tad difficult to find seating. Fortunately, there's also seating outdoors. S'mores and espresso martinis.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The wife and I stopped in late night after dinner. I needed a little caffeine before the drive back to our hotel. We stumbled upon Halcyon and it had a great vibe going on. We lucked out and got a little corner area to sit and take in all the action as we had a view of the whole place. Now this review is mainly for the cold brew coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores dessert that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few tables. I'm sure that they have some other food options, but we really didn't take a look at the menu other than for coffees and teas. We would definitely return and hang out at Halcyon whenever we find ourselves in downtown Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"We got breakfast here to kick off a day in Austin - it was pretty great. Good selection of all the coffee beverages you'd want. Iced coffee was a good - not too bitter, just the way I like it. We also got the Migas breakfast tacos with avocado cream. They were really good, but beware the red salsa - it is extremely spicy. Also enjoyed the overnight French toast. Service was friendly and the place was very quiet and peaceful on a Sunday morning.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange lighting, live music (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous people on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very cozy and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your table? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My cappuccino came in a giant cozy mug. My friend's latte came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The baristas were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate atmosphere for whoever you choose to come with. Open late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an americano and peppermint latte in the background",1
Coffee Shop 29,I had the cosmonaut and it was pretty darn good! The vibe is chill and their music playlist was bomb(in a good way). We also ordered the s'mores and it was really fun and tasty too! Too bad we aren't from Austin because Id probably be here all the time if we lived here! Smores!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Cool place that has Austin written all over it.  Good food, polite service, and excellent coffee.   They even offer their own brand of coffee for sale.   Would certainly recommend this place to a friend.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"What are you in the mood for? Coffee?, wine? Mimosa? Or a cigar? This place seems to have it all...what they don't have is table service, so be prepared to order at the register! Food menu is limited. Bar at halycon.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"OVERALL: great place for a quick bite for dessert on a date!  AMBIENCE: perfect little place to go for a date with mild lighting and couches for you to sit. These couches have very comfortable pillows to make you feel like you're in your own home. There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live music playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.  TASTE: we had the smores for 2 people which was about $7. It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but pay at the counter and they bring it to you. They don't really check up on you until you are on your way out. Staff is nice though! Basic smores for 2 with moist towelettes for the mess! Date night with the private corner of pillows! Super comfy, I thought I could fall asleep there.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Really needed some coffee around midnight since we flew in on a Friday and were tired from the traveling.  We were really surprised how there was a cafe right in the middle of downtown where the party was happening!  Got an iced latte and it was good.  Very nice espresso with whole milk.  Tried a bit of the soy chai latte and typically I'm not a huge chai fan, but it was some tasty brew!  Didn't try the food, but plenty of people had drinks from the bar also on a Friday night.  The atmosphere is definitely on the cool side.  Outdoor area is great for people watching.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"After a stroll on town lake with a friend in from California, we wanted to grab a cup of coffee and be able to chill out to people watch. I had my dog Nymeria with me as well so I suggest Halcyon because of the seating outside and I've heard people rave about this place. This was a chill day after New years winter day in Austin so the weather was perfect. We parked nearby and my friend waited outside with the dog so I went in to order. The line was about 5 people deep and the inside place was pretty full. One thing that I thought Halcyon did well is the different flavors of hot chocolate. I ordered their special of the day which was Mocha La'orange (mocha with an orange zest) and my friend got their Mayan hot chocolate (spices and cinnamon). I asked about how long the drinks would be so I know about what time to come back inside to grab them, the barista said 5-7 minutes. Usually I wouldn't care but we also had a parking meter ticking for 30 minutes. I came back outside and I loved where we sat because there was heat lamps above to keep us warm. I did notice however where we were were the only place with heat lamps, no where else on the patio. After about 7-10 minutes I went inside and was hoping my drinks would be on the counter. No one acknowledged me and I looked around to see if the people that were ahead of me got their drinks already, not yet either. About 2-3 more mintes pass by and the couple that was infront of me in line finally got their drinks called so I figured ours would be up soon. Turns out I end up waiting another 10 minutes for our drinks. End of the story, took us 20+ minutes to get the coffee drinks, not much people watching was done on my part because I spent all that time inside, my dog got lots of praises for being cute, and we were just a few minutes late back to the truck after the meter ran out.  Dont get me wrong, our drinks were pretty good, but I would not come back here again when there are so many much better service at other coffee shops in town that also serve a good cup of joe.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is a perfect stop for an afternoon coffee or late-night drinks with friends. The vibes, staff and patrons are friendly - a refreshing change of pace from those other manic, packed downtown ATX venues. Grab a local beer with some friends and enjoy this unique venue. True, authentic Austin charm.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Sometimes Mr. Smidgens like to chill. . You can chill with your friends or choose to chill alone.  Halcyon is the place to make this happen. Soooo, chill. The bar of course!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in The Attraction of Austin When I checked in here, Yelp asked me, ""Is this place Hipster?""  The answer is DOUBLE YES.  I almost caught myself on fire walking past the mini-grills, as everyone made s'mores on their tables.  Regardless of your feelings toward the Hipster...movement...Halcyon is a fun place.  They have eight different kinds of hot Toddy's!  Eight!  The Buttery Rum is absolutely delicious.  A friend ordered coffee with Bailey's and was happy as a clam.  Their signs were funny - ""Are you hungry? We'll get you drunk. Are you thirsty? We'll get you drunk. Are you lonely? We'll get you drunk.""  The drinks took quite a while to make, so come by if you've time to chill out and aren't rushing somewhere. ""Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, all the vices in one place.""",1

Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 3 check-ins Generally enjoy Halycon. Daytime and nighttime. Drinks and snacks are good, especially the Insomniac. I like working on my laptop here but fundamentally believe I shouldn't be forced to buy TWC Wifi because Halycons connection is so bad. Reconsidering my default work spot.  Update: Internet connection seems to be much better! Owner also contacted me on Yelp to apologize. Yay!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Coffee was fine. But I waited 45 minutes for my flatbread order even though it wasn't really busy. After 30 minutes of waiting I asked them if it was almost ready and apparently they totally missed my order.,0
Coffee Shop 29,"We love this place. It's all kinds of coffee, liquor, and food goodness wrapped up in the best vibe ever.  The service is warm and friendly. You are in the South, you know.  The atmosphere is chic and casual. Noise levels are completely perfect for intimate conversation and they have outdoor seating.  We visited multiple times on our last visit to Austin and mostly did coffee and breakfast. Both very tasty. We did come for a cocktail in the late afternoon and the bartender made a concoction that was delectable. The Bees Knees, I believe.  This is a place I recommend frequently to friends visiting Austin. You should go.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Disappointed that they ran out of french toast when we went, but their panini was very delicious - a must have! Egg panini w sausage and cheese - amazing",1
Coffee Shop 29,Came in for coffee on our way out of Austin.  We all decided to get Vietnamese coffees.  They were so delicious! Even the non coffee-lover we had with us enjoyed it.  Perfect on temperature and sweetness. Vietnamese Coffee,1
Coffee Shop 29,The coffee was great the atmosphere was comfortable. A great spot to be if you want to be downtown and not in a bar or club.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"This place is a cool hang out. The decor in this place is awesome, with great lion artwork on each wall. They have a pretty extensive liquor selection, and they have a pretty wide variety of beers. The only thing not great about this place is they do not have a tap for beers or cold brew coffee. If this place had that I would give it 5 stars. Still a cool place though. All the art in the shop is lion themed Beer and liquor selection",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Cool vibe, great art on the walls and music. There is a full bar, coffee and snacks. Plenty of room to chill and get some work done.  If you think of what has happened to Cecil the lion, then all the pictures of Lions will get another meaning. Like a reminder for us people, that we owe to the Animal kingdom.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"7 check-ins MUST TRY!! Absolutely adore the iced mocha. The iced vanilla latte was also good compared to other places I have tried. For both iced drinks it was $10.28 so it was a bit pricey, but I don't think that will deter me (my poor wallet lol). I didn't really investigate for stamp cards, but I will next time.  The inside was very cozy and had great Austin flare. A good amount of seating ranging from couches, to tables to little pillow bed-ish couches in the corners. I think it's a great place to study or come from brunch. They do have a food menu but the times which breakfast and such are served is limited. I came in for a waffle that I saw on yelp but I came in too late. Coffee barely lasted until the end of the review",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins Fun atmosphere and vibe. I ordered a coconut mocha drink that was too sweet until it watered down a bit. A friend ordered a coffee that was just slightly above room temp, while another friend ordered hot tea that felt like it was heated on the surface of the sun. There was little to supplement the hang out experience. Their wifi was abysmal even though the place was relatively empty at the time (I have seen it much more congested). The board games had missing pieces and the restroom door did not lock properly nor was it very clean. Considering the hype for this place, the experience fell short.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"bleh.  A cool concept, cramming a lot of different things (coffee shop, bar, restaurant, patio, etc.) into a very small space. What I've tried (mostly coffee) has been pretty good but the low rating is due to the smoke. You can't get through or even around the place while trying to walk by without breathing in smoke, it's horrible. The ""15 foot"" law is completely and utterly ignored.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"I love going here on a random night out. They have a great selection of coffee and tea! Warning: their drinks are extra hot (as they should be). Not lukewarm like some places. They even have s'mores. I mean, need I say more? It's a great place to take your friends from out of town or a coffee date. My favorite is the earl grey tea there. S'mores!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Favorite Coffee Shops This place was so neat! I've heard so many things about this ""smores bar"" place and it didn't disappoint! We had a party if 4 and order the big platter of smores and 2 glasses of wine! The wait staff was super friendly! We were from out of town and they recommend a few other places to try!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Friendly service, fun atmosphere and free music. Everything an evening spot should have. They also have outdoor seating and a walk-in humidor! Awesome Ginger toddy. Delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The two things I ordered at Halcyon both involved chocolate.  1) S'mores This is an ingenious idea that I wish more coffee shops did. It was freezing (for Austin) standards and I had a lot of fun torching marshmallows (and watching my girlfriend light a few on fire) before squashing them in between some Graham crackers and chocolate. Love it.  2) Some sort of chocolate martini thing. I don't really know what it was because I was drunk, but it sure was yummy when I had it! You should be able to figure it out when you get there.  Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seats for its location downtown. You seat yourself, and I think most people have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having. There aren't many electrical outlets handy, so that certainly helps keep the stereotypical buy-one-coffee-and-stay-all-day-on-your-laptop customers away.  I highly recommend it as a good meet up spot and date location! The bar",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been coming here for years, like 7 years. I did come a lot to day drink because the bar opens at 7am! Well today I'm here for coffee and avocado smash toast, which is toast with avocado and salmon. There's only 3 people in this entire establishment and this toast is taking over 32 minutes. Man this place sucks",0
Coffee Shop 29,"It was super crowded however, I loved the atmosphere. Amazing coffee. S'mores were amazing! I will go back during day time hours. 9:00 on a Friday evening is a little intense.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins This place rocks!  I'm from Chicago with a Starbucks on every corner. I love visiting independently owned coffee houses. But most don't have such an awesome food menu. On a short trip to get out of the cold weather, I stopped here twice. Customer service is beyond expectational!  Both times, I asked if menu items could be tweaked or combined to reflect my low-carb way of eating. Not only did they help me figure out the best meal, the food was awesome and beyond what I anticipated!  And most importantly they didn't act like I was putting them out. It has a great porch, clean restrooms and the ambience is really nice!  The coffee is delicious too! Specially made salad.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Very cozy, eclectic coffee shop with a hip vibe.  Located right on the corner, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.    Had the Nutella/Banana Belgian Waffles, Egg/Bacon/Cheddar panini, and slow pour coffee.  The food is fresh and very well prepared, but most importantly, it was delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Great coffee and breakfast spot! On the more quiet side of town. Egg panini was fantastic!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"This is a great breakfast place! I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a breakfast sandwich comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy breakfast at this low key joint. The sandwich itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of caffeine, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the barista actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local artists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have cozy places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The baristas are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the wifi is free! As a business traveler, it was nice to get on quickly without having to login or see any ads. This was definitely a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place to travelers, and I hope it's a hit with the locals too! Lox bagel and Thai iced coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Popped into Halcyon 10:30pm on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed but we managed to find a nice seat. The employee taking our order wasn't pleasant and had a very fast paced attitude. We went with the s'mores for two, a mudslide, and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!  They had this dreamboat guy singing indie music, he had such a wonderful voice, we clapped with all our hearts after each tune and we received death stares from people reading their books...sheesh!  FUN FUN times at Halcyon! S'more fun!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Three of my favorite things in life: coffee, cocktails, and dessert. Great location too. Visited a few times so far, first time had lunch, other times had drinks, coffee, and s'mores on the last date. Only comes with one or two servings so would have been down for a double order. Because of the night time buzz people seem very social even in the day time for a cafe when you want to just be working with wifi. Not the silent-whisper to your friend kind of cafe. Good times.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Good place for coffee. Espresso was a bit watered down, though their La Marzocco machine is nice and I suspect it was just a poorly dialed in shot (but they obliged to give me a pull of a single origin). Iced toddy brew and cappuccino were solid. Good seating inside and out.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 2 check-ins Went here one night with my little sis to catch up since I moved to Houston, and what a great place to do so! We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores snack/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The cashier up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The atmosphere is really chill. A nice cafe to go to when you don't wanna be dealing with 6th street drunkards. I do gotta say though claim your seats swiftly and quickly! Dem seats are in demand.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"A very relaxing cool atmosphere. My bestfriend who visits Austin often comes here during the day to get coffee and do her art. She loves this place and told us to come by!  I ordered what my friend usually gets which is a hazelnut frappaccino. It was so delicious not too sweet and had so much flavor! It is a bit on the really creamy side especially when you're down to the bottom of the frap it gets really foamy but eh, I don't mind that!  I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone seems to be to themselves but very friendly. A great place to study not too loud and pretty relaxing music. It's way better than Starbucks and if you're visiting in town like me I would definitely suggest this coffee place as a must stop by!",1
Coffee Shop 29,If you only have time for one bar or coffee shop in Austin.... Go here. Best mojito I've had in Austin. Also the amazing coffee goes great with the smores!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I love chocolate. I also love ice cream. And tea. And hot chocolate. Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet caramel. I really love caramel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about. The seating is sectioned off, there's pillows everywhere...",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been here multiple times, and I normally would give it five stars, except that parking is always insane, because this is on the corner of such a busy area!  Their food is great, and the drinks to me are just okay. What makes this place so cool is the atmosphere and the type of people that frequent here. You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of people all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea latte.  So, I always give special props and good reviews to those that have great service! The menu",1

Coffee Shop 29,"6 check-ins Used to come here frequently in the summer to read and hang out while waiting for my bf to get off of work downtown. Definitely a cool place to chill if you can find the space. Seating is pretty limited and the place is normally filled with other people working. (which is probably a good sign otherwise) Always a lot of cool art on the walls. I normally would order the hazelnut frappe but have tried the different iced teas, thai iced tea and have gotten a salmon salad that was one of their specials and have tried other things off their menu. Food is always pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try drinks from the bar but in terms of my other drinks I've had slightly sloppy drinks made here and really really good ones depending on the barista. Tipping definitely will go a long way here..",1

My office had a taste test with various vendors in downtown and Halcyon won, hands down.  As an added bonus, everyone at Halcyon is friendly and goes out of their way to make sure I'm happy. Mari and Jules are especially great and always greet me with a smile, making me feel like I'm entering into a friend's kitchen.  If I could give more than five stars, I would!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I've hated on Halcyon for a while. It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go downtown, but couldn't actually go downtown (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au lait's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon.",1

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,Very cool decor! Good drinks Nice seating  However...  Just about everything is overpriced. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a cortado. No WiFi Music is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several tables were dirty when we got there. Service is average.  It feels like a Los Angeles coffee shot that is out of place.,0
Coffee Shop 66,"They are located within the Northcross mall shopping center facing east toward Burnet Rd with plenty of parking. I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

Coffee Shop 66,"Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado",1
Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Coffee Shop 66,3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

Coffee Shop 66,This is such a cute little cafe! I've driven by this place many times and hadn't noticed it until today. Glad I stopped-the famous chicken waffle was delish!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Beautiful eccentric coffee shop with a library of peculiar books.  Swings, couches, and pillow corners for cuddle puddles.  Coffee with mint and ways you've never imagined coffee could be made. Try the matcha green tea with soy, creamiest matcha I've ever had.  First time here and already my favorite coffee bar so far.

Coffee Shop 66,"Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again. Double espresso with tonic water. Beautiful Macha A beary lovely mocha!",1
Coffee Shop 66,Really love the atmosphere here! I frequent coffee shops and this one is definitely unique and worth checking out.  Pros: great atmosphere Friendly staff Good hangout/ study environment Beautiful lighting Tasty drinks  Cons: no wifi Slightly pricey Pretty things Love all the details here. It just has good vibes. Definitely the perfect cafe atmosphere. See all photos from Sierra L. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,1
Coffee Shop 66,"Check out this video for a review! youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ki…  Cool new place in Austin! It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun. One thing is that there's no internet, so don't plan on coming here to get stuff done!  You get to order on an ipad! yay.  Pros: - the drink choices are really great. You can get something that you want. You can even get beer here. - great for pictures and enjoying some time off. Sit on a swing ... while playing chase. - parking is plentiful in the plaza area. - friendly baristas  Cons: - food menu isn't too big, but that's okay. Not gluten free for the wife. - very pricey. If you need a place to come on a weekly basis, you're going to need to be a balla.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3.",1

Coffee Shop 66,"Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought, just a cafe with a couple of food options. The Nutella waffles we got were on point - there's also a chicken option.  The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options. I hope they add more items to the menu! Milk tea - humongous!! Nutella banana waffles Love the illustrations! See all photos from Ramya B. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",1
Coffee Shop 66,"The greeting of an atmosphere it feels I created. This place speaks to my free spirited soul, with matcha lattes, swings inside that still fit in, pillows, and waffles.

Coffee Shop 66,"Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated prices and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Guys, this place is amazing. Limited food menu but both waffle offerings will blow you away! Crazy good spices on the chicken. The coffee and matcha were both stellar as well. Service was friendly and efficient. The space is stunning and cozy. Highly recommend. Will be my new go-to relaxation spot in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks. Highly recommended, so get here when you can!",1

Coffee Shop 66,"Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit. You will want to try their swing for sure.

Drinks were good, though make sure you have enough in your bank account because their drinks are probably not for broke college students. That swing!",1

Coffee Shop 66,"7 check-ins The Factory Cafe is overall such a beautiful and really cool place to just hang out with friends or work on homework. You'll probably see the people around you taking the time to perfect their aesthetic Instagram pictures and Snapchat stories (myself included).

So cute!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"My only complaint and desire and heart wish is for this place to be open longer and to allow for Wifi.

The atmosphere is PERFECT, the workers are GENEROUS AND KIND, it's a beautiful place to be.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces.

Coffee Shop 66,"Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!  This place has homemade pop tarts!",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This place is really nice. They have done a great job... It's the type of place that you could spend hours in.

Coffee Shop 66,"A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.",0
Coffee Shop 66,"Honestly, this place is having an identity crisis. Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute decor (props to the designer), but music is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed art of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay open till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a beer/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the owners will rethink their direction. Would I come back? Eeh, too many other treats to entice my attention.",0

It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic!

I will definitely return with company, but prices weren't good enough to make this a regular stop in our rotation.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"Love the Factory. Good coffee, tasty chicken and waffles and awesome atmosphere. Definitely recommend the Nutella waffle.",1
Coffee Shop 66,AMAZING atmosphere! I walked around for 5 minutes looking at everything before even ordering.  Most unique take on chicken and waffles I've ever had. Hands down best night time hangout in North Austin. P.S.... their Matcha Latte is to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 66,"I am very impressed with this place. The food portions were so perfect and not mention delicious! The waffle architects (staff) were all so accommodating and nice.

I will definitely be coming back when I am in Austin again. Nutella and Banana waffles. Chicken and Waffles, Olive Oil Pound Cake, and Milk Tea! Yummy.",1
Coffee Shop 66,"This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful art.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very expensive for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.",0

Coffee Shop 12,"2 check-ins Love it here! They have a ton of coffee options including a huge selection of flavors to add to your drink, pastries including a peanut butter cup that was delicious, and really good brunch food!  I ordered a sweet potato hash and it was the perfect amount of food and was fresh and filling. I love that you can choose to either sit outside or indoors, and that there is ample seating for either choice. Their outdoor tables are covered to protect you from the sun, and they occasionally have live music as well.  The coffee here was OK. Nothing great, but not bad. I only tried their drip and not their espresso but I'm not sure if I would come here just for coffee. Would definitely return for lunch or breakfast though.  One thing about brunch in Austin is that it usually means long waits, pricey food and minimal seating, but Cherrywood definitely restored my faith in brunch by serving me some really great food without these worries! Sweet potato hash. Delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 12,I was not disappointed. This is worthy of 4 stars. I got the shrimp and grits. Too many onions. Cameral latte. Parking sucks and the lines can be long but be patient. Price is decent though.  They do have TV's so I didn't miss out on football.  Seat yourself.  Enjoy,1
Coffee Shop 12,I popped up shop here a couple weeks back & their brunch is on point! It was the perfect concept... a market and brunch. Try everything! Banana waffles,1
Coffee Shop 12,"What we ordered: 2 Shrimp & Grits ($9.95 each), 1 Iced Coffee, and 1 Iced Tea. Total bill is $28.XX. You order food & drink upon arrival at the register. Pick up the drinks right there & they will bring the food to your table when it's done.  Pricing: I would say the price for food is very reasonable. Only the drinks are a little pricey to my opinion.  Food quality: Shrimp & Grits would be an ideal & safe option if you don't know what to order. The dish is very flavorful & worth the price. The shrimp is fresh & they give you quite a good portion of the shrimp. The portion as a whole is just enough to fill you up full too.  Decor: I love everything about it. The inside area is very cute & modern with the lanterns. The outside patio is super cute & romantic. The spacing between each dining table gives just enough privacy for each party. The trees help a lot with the coverage to cool down the summer heat. I'm sitting here right now at 2 p.m. with 100 F degree but still don't feel like it at all. Just make sure you watch out for the bird's poop! (not sure how to do it though lol but just prepare your mind for such luck!) Shrimp & Grits! Soooo good. The other side of the outdoor patio. Love it! See all photos from Thao N. for Cherrywood Coffeehouse",1
Coffee Shop 12,"LOVED the food and coffee here. The biscuits and gravy are possibly the best I've ever had! And the Cuban con leche coffee is delicious! Always love the added foam design on top :) Really enjoyed the atmosphere. Service was very quick, even while supeThe only tricky thing is seating. On a Saturday morning, a group larger than 4 may have to be creative. Definitely check this place out- any time of day. You won't be disappointed. THE BEST biscuits and gravy that have ever existed. And the DELICIOUS Cuban con leche. Super cool decor and atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"We were at Home Depot talking about finding a coffee place that also serves food, and this place was recommended by an employee who lives in the neighborhood.  I love the history behind the place, and the food and drinks were pretty good!  I ordered the shrimp and grits, and the only flaw with the meal was that it was a little on the oily side. I'm pretty sure it was from the bits of bacon they threw in there,  so that was forgivable.  My hubby got their bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and he loved it.  We'll definitely be back! Shrimp and grits (comes with bacon)",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Listed in Americano I've been meaning to try this place out and so sad I didn't come try any earlier! Cherrywood Coffeehouse isn't too far from west campus and there's so many seating available. They have a ton of food and drink selections (both bottled/ packaged and made in the bar).  Pros: +Their Iced Americano was one of the best I've ever had! The water to espresso ratio was spot on and not one of those super watered down coffee.  Cons: -Not every seat has outlets available so if you're here to study, I'd charge my laptop to full before coming! -There's a TV area and when I came by, a group of guys came to watch some dramatic show all together... Made a lot of noise. I'm glad I had brought earphones.  Atmosphere/ Location: The lighting is not too bright. Walking right in, I felt welcomed and greeted by the wonderful smell of the coffee beans. This location looks really scary and ghetto in the daylight but so pretty and fancy at night when the lights are lit!  Service: The guy behind the bar was very kind and friendly. My friend was interested in the packaged drinks and he seemed to be knowledgeable about the products they sell and even gave suggestions. Around their closing time, a girl worker came by and politely told us they're closing soon. I know so many coffee shops that just shut the music and the lights out by closing even when the customers are present so I was pleased with their respectful treatment! Iced Americano $2.50",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Good coffee, yummy breakfast tacos, long line but we got our food quickly! My first time in Austin, but I've noticed there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian options around town. Fun atmosphere Big ole breakfast tacos!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This was a nice coffee shop with great food. While I was there I got a vanilla latte that tasted good and the fried shrimp that was also good. The place was clean and the servers were friendly. For me, the only small complaint was the music was a little too loud for my liking, but overall I give it a 5 out of 5! Fried shrimp was good! Vanilla latte was good",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Great coffee, friendly service. This place isn't easy to see from the street, but it's definitely worth stopping, if you spot it. This is a must-visit place for us every time we're in Austin. Drip coffee...",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I'm really sad to leave this review because everything started off so great! I ordered the club sandwich to go, (via favor) and it got here packed perfectly and warm still. Fries were great and still good not even soggy through the delivery.  The sandwich : absolutely great when I took my first bite, i mean it was a great club!! Then when I moved on to my second piece I felt something weird in my mouth and it was a hair!! Ok gross but I've worked in restaurants and I can throw away the contaminated area and eat around it plus I had no other lunch options .... NOPE, I didn't even bit into another piece before I saw a long hair just sticking right out next to the freaking toothpick. So I literally dissected the sandwich and found 5 hairs total... That is disgusting!! It was my first time there and now I'll never go back because apparently there's an issue with hair in the food The club--- filled with hair!! Hair and MORE HAIR not including the piece I spit out OR the other piece I threw away Hair and MORE HAIR not including the piece I spit out OR the other piece I threw away",0
Coffee Shop 12,"Guys, the burgers!  I know, right? At a coffee house?  They are sooooo good.  And the queso fries...mmmmMmmmmm.  You will not be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 12,3 check-ins Hipster and cool.  Great menu and music.  Amazing cool AC inside and patio outside.  My new film meeting hang out.,1
Coffee Shop 12,"14 check-ins I have come to truly enjoy this local neighborhood spot. I usually walk here with my dog because they have a great patio area and plenty of doggy water bowls, you just have to grab water from the self-serve station inside. I also need help with my french fries and he's the best french fry wingman. This place is a little bit of a coffee house, bistro with great food and bar. I've tried most of their sandwiches and I must say I am a fan. My favorite are the Bahn mí and the Cuban sandwich. Both delicious. Can't get enough of their fries so they are a must with a meal. Their regular iced coffee is strong enough for when you don't feel like dishing out for coffee. Their cuban con leche is nice and strong and delicious. Have yet to try pastries, but I see a lot of others trying it. They have music playing outside and they also tend to do shows and events which is neat for the neighborhood.  You order at the counter. You get a number and wait for your drinks at counter 2. The food comes to you.  Great atmosphere. Great food. Great coffee. Have yet to try their beers, so I will update this down the line. Báhn mi. One of my faves here.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This place is great!  I appreciate the different coffees, options of beer and wine and delicious food.  It's average noise level so you can come and chat it up with a friend, but it's not too noisy so you can certainly get some reading or studying done too!  All around cool place! Chicken poblano club Banana Bread without nuts Lavender iced latte",1
Coffee Shop 12,The classic taco was pretty delicious with almost french fry styled potatoes and thicker bacon with some pretty alright salsa. The portions are great for the price.,1
Coffee Shop 12,"An Austin hipster coffee house and brunch spot with a little more of everything. Pros: Places to sit in or out, good for groups up to 6, menu is good for brunch/lunch, lots of pastries and specials, and good selection of beverages, handicap accessible (is ok for wheelchairs but you may need to maneuver to get the right spot), food quality is good, food speed is good, staff is helpful and friendly, good place to study, environment/aesthetics are nice Cons: parking is limited, handicapped parking is available but limited, food and beverages are not fancy (not meant to be for this location and audience) Overall: access was good, food was timely and good, our mother in the wheelchair enjoyed it and felt comfortable being there. We would definitely go back for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or to work from the location",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I liked this place for lunch because they do have real food. The club sandwich was $10 and I should have split it. It's a huge meal!  The side salad was delicious. Fresh, great size, comes with feta and some fresh avocado.  I got an iced mocha on the way out and it was wonderful.  They also take Go Local cards which is great too.  The parking lot kind of sucks. I got trapped in my spot by this seemingly meth crazed dude inside, hopefully I never see him again hahaha.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"The staff was very rude to our group. They took 35 mins to bring our food and forgot the ticket. They never apologized. When they finally brought our food, they had dumped a ton of oil on top of the shrimp and grits. Can't tell if they were messing with us on purpose of if they just accidentally dumped a cup of oil on it. I had the shrimp and grits and it looked fine. Then when they brought the second order out (they had forgotten) is was soaked in oil.  Ohh.. And also we found a hair in the food.",0
Coffee Shop 12,"I really like coming here for business meetings because it's not too loud and the atmosphere is really laid back. They have free wifi, and options for food and drink.  Today I ordered food for the first time and I got the club sandwich. It was so good and fully loaded. They are not cheap in the ingredients meat included, and I really like the bread they serve it on. I also ordered an iced coffee and it was pretty good.  I highly recommend this place but, just know it does get busy during the school year with tons of student's studying. But, they do have outside seating",1
Coffee Shop 12,"The Luna taco night just be in the top 3 breakfast tacos I have ever had. It certainly wins top vegetarian taco I've ever had, and I'm not a vegetarian but it would be easy to be one if I could eat this taco everyday. I got it on corn so it was very messy and I had to eat a lot of it with a fork, but at least that forced me to slow down and savor this deliciousness! Also, it was huge. 1 was plenty. I also got an iced almond milk latte which was fine. Good enough to get again but not my favorite I've ever had, no big deal. I liked the interior decor of this place and it was very conducive to meeting & having conversations with new people - several friendly people told me that they were regulars and had convinced others to become regulars too. I'd go here again for sure!!! Luna taco on corn and iced almond milk latte",1
Coffee Shop 12,"What a cute coffeehouse! I lived in Hyde Park for years but never made it to this gem on the east side of the highway. Came here for breakfast with a few friends, and left with a belly full of delicious breakfast tacos and coffee. Loved the sol taco! You only need one of these huge tacos to fill you up. The chorizo and migas tacos were smaller, so I ordered both. The chorizo was definitely better than the migas, which was just ok. Coffee is really great here, but no free refills on coffee! Lots of outdoor seating, and art for sale on the walls. Friendly employees and customers. Sol breakfast taco",1
Coffee Shop 12,"My absolute FAVORITE coffehouse in Austin! The staff is friendly, there is plenty of space, the coffee is good, and the food is as delicious as it is reasonably priced! Literally my only complaint is the music gets really loud late, late in the evening which is not the nicest studying environment. However, for what they offer, it's definitely no dealbreaker. Love love LOVE Cherrywood!!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Came here based on yelp reviews. They did not disappoint!  Affordable, delicious, quick and hip! We ordered the waffle, sol taco, almond latte and a coffee for under $20. Everything was amazing. Definitely recommend for a fast budget friendly breakfast. Banana walnut waffle with almond latte. Sol taco. Waffle with banana and nuts. Latte with almond syrup. Patio - dogs allowed!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"One of the best coffee places in Austin.  Very chill atmosphere and sometimes they have good live music.  Parking is obviously difficult, but you can always street park a block or two away.  Breakfast and brunch are really good here.  The Cuban Con Leche with condensed milk is quite good (aka Vietnamese Coffee lol).  Outdoor seating when it's nice out is quite chill.  Just avoid sitting at the one lone table that's tucked away near the center of the yard. There's a King Joffrey of squirrels chilling on the tree branches up above that will crap on you or eat their nuts and spit it all over your food.  Bastard!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"We love the food and coffee here! The baked goods and tacos are scrumptious. Visiting on the weekends is super crazy and the staff is usually beyond frazzled, but they do a great job.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I love this place for so many reasons.  The food is good (especially for a coffee shop) for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The breakfast sandwiches and a nap are a good cure-all for a Sunday hangover.    The space is nice and there's typically plenty of seats throughout the day.  They rotate art work there so there's always a little bit of a different feel every few months.    And most importantly, the staff and service are awesome. They're super friendly and I enjoy the vibe they create there.",1
Coffee Shop 12,This is the last day of SXSW and there's a singer songwriter and a backup guitarist on the patio rocking it. This place has such a chill vibe that I'm all about it. The breakfast sandwich was much bigger than I thought it was going to be. The bread is similar to Hawaiian bread.,1
Coffee Shop 12,"I'm definitely going to make this a return destination. The Sol Taco was excellent and a great value for breakfast. I also like the idea of lining up to order, which made it much easier for the large group I was in to get their food pronto. This place has an unpretentious atmosphere and a huge outdoor patio that is dog friendly.  I'd say it checked all the boxes for this brunch.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I originally checked out this place with some friends that wanted to catch the open mic night.  It was fun, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, menu, and laid back people.  I will be going back.  I am somewhat new to the neighborhood, and this is a nice find.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"4 check-ins It's a neat little neighborhood haunt. Their beers tend to run hoppier and drier, and their cider selection is meh. Having said that, I always enjoy coming here. They have big tables for gaming with friends, and their burgers are goooood. I get the standard hamburger with the sweet wheat bun. It's suuuuuper delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 12,Had the crawfish eggs Benedict. Perfect combination of spicy and savory. Also comes with a side of your choice. I had the the bacon and I'm pretty sure it was cooked in the oven because it was evenly toasted. There was a fairly long line when we got there @ 10:30 on Sunday but it went surprisingly fast and there was plenty of seating outside and inside.,1
Coffee Shop 12,"Yummy food, great drinks, quick service, great patio... What else do you need?!  They worked with my allergies and I still had a delicious meal, a great coffee, got to sit outside and enjoy the conversation with my friend without being rushed!  I got the sweet potato hash with a sausage side (with modifications) and a lavender latte. *swoon*  Typical Austin parking, but the dogs on the patio, kids area, and great food make walking from nearby worth it!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Eh, I just am not a fan, I tried this place yesterday, walked in ordered couple tacos and bottle soda was almost 11 bucks. tacos were very bland, no seasoning.  cute place, no parking, place is actually bigger than I though. They do have patio seating. About 5 people in line ahead of me, took about 20 minutes. Lady with long blonde hair, not pulled back, touched hair a few times.   Just eh.. between the bland food and lack of parking I probably wont be back",0
Coffee Shop 12,"This place is solid all around. Their hibiscus mint tea is addictive...I went through multiple servings of it, made possible by their free refill policy. Then I enjoyed the cripsy fish sandwich, with lettuce, tomatoes, and aioli. So amazing. It was the kind of quality fish sandwich you would expect from a seafood restaurant, so to have such amazing food options at a coffeehouse definitely blew me away. And the sandwiches come with a side of delicious chips and salsa (although there are other options too). It is a great place to come for a meal, or even to get some work done. They have ample seating, including outdoors, and have great music playing at just the right volume to not be obtrusive. The staff is also very friendly, and non judgmental about how many refills I indulged in.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I really dig this place for some chill breakfast & coffee.  I recently had the all-American breakfast, and an awesome blueberry smoothie with peanut butter, apple juice, banana, and almond milk.  Great place for working on a laptop at a large desk with cherrywood seats. Service was super-friendly.  I would give five stars, if parking wasn't so difficult. Dog-friendly on the outside patio. Outdoor deck. Dog-friendly. Main dining area.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Perhaps I missed this place when I was at UT, but coming back recently, glad to have found this spot. Lots of seating, inside/outside, and tons of different options. It's nice to have a place where you can work at, hang out at, and have that space be pretty versatile.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Cool vibes, perfect benedict, but their mimosa game is weak.  Outdoor seats are great, especially with the Austin whether these days! Pretty crowded indoor seats, though. A lot of people on their computers working on some things.  They also had awesome croissants.",1
Coffee Shop 12,Very cozy and comfortable vibe~ I went in after 2 hours biking on Sunday chill night ( around 37℉). It feels so great to have some snacks and hot tea to satisfy me! I can eat and relaxing for a while! Just love it. Hot tea! Big nachos~ See all photos from Joe H. for Cherrywood Coffeehouse,1
Coffee Shop 12,"What a great place for brunch when there's nice weather out! My friends and I actually came here based on the yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. Yelp said they play live music, there was a man playing the guitar. Yelp said atmosphere is slightly hipster/casual, that's pretty true. People tend to be on their laptops doing school work and what not. Yelp said their food was worth it, and yet they are right once again.  I highly recommend the Shrimp and Grits! It is pure perfection with the grits being the right consistency and the shrimp having the right amount of spice. They are also quite generous with the amount of shrimp given in the plate (approx. 10). I would give my plate a 10/10. My two friends got their Crawfish Egg Benedict and said that it was tasty. My other friend got a normal burger and said it was juicy. They all gave their dishes an 8/10.  Only downfall with this place is that they are pretty slow with bringing out everyone's food. They did it one by one, so by the time someone was done, they brought out another person's plate. They also forgot my friends order, so he actually had to go in and bring the plate out to the patio himself. Overall, I would come back here, but there are little things here and there that would make this place a 5/5. Crawfish Eggs Benedict! The best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Wonderful very local coffeehouse with ""Mother Earth"" overtones. Food was very good, coffee was excellent, atmosphere great. Will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 12,Updated review 2 check-ins Lots of good h Choices of food to esat. Big smoothies. Helpful staff and huge french fries. Next time try gyros for me and buscuits and gravy for Christian.  Hubby Liked sunset lane and blueberry was very peanut buttery and delicious! Blueberry peanut butter smoothie! Huge loaded fries!,1
Coffee Shop 12,"New to the neighborhood. Hoped for a quality local coffee shop.  Ordered a cappuccino and a americano. The roast they used was excessively burned. The cappuccino was over brewed to the point of being undrinkable. The americano was watery and underbrewed.  They apologetically and promptly remade the coffees, explaining that they were training a new 'barista'.  The next batch wasn't much of an improvement, despite being made by one of their *trained baristas*. Both turned out milky and weak.  I didn't try anything else made by them, so I can't comment on the quality of the food or other drinks. If you're looking for a good cup of coffee, skip this place.  tl;dr coffee on par with 711 and Starbucks; quick accommodating service",0
Coffee Shop 12,I love this place and amazing spot have a great breakfast and catch up on some home work. Great seating space inside and outside. I'll be back again!! Egg benedict was so tasty,1
Coffee Shop 12,"I read the online menu. Everything sounded so good and I was starving! I ordered the fish tacos with chips and salsa, and I ordered a bahn mi with a cucumber salad for my boyfriend. We thought it was nasty. The fish in my tacos very slimy, barely crispy. The radish slaw tasted old. The sauce was ok, not the best. The chips have a weird burnt aftertaste.  Salsa seemed watered down, not very flavorful, and barely spicy! My boyfriend said that the pork in his bahm mi tasted like chicken. He was expecting it to taste like a traditional bahn mi, so he was severly disappointed. Also, he said the cucumber salad was way too vinegary. Very sad. Probably will not be coming back ever. Look at how sad this taco is.",0
Coffee Shop 12,"The granola yogurt is amazeballs, inside is spacious and atmosphere is relaxed. Definitely was worth trying out this new spot. They have breakfast all day and lunch is served as well. Mocha cappuccino and granola yogurt was very flavorful.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Great coffee, yummy breakfast,, cool atmosphere. I had one of the best eggs benedict I've ever eaten here. A great breakfast & a perfect cup of joe.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Delicious food, awesome atmosphere. Just do not like the long lines stretching out the door on brunch days.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This place is solid! Nice coffeehouse with some really good food - not your typical coffee place with just sandwiches and pastries. The shrimp and grits were delicious! Nice cajun flavors and the shrimp were well-seasoned. I added strawberry jam for a sweet aspect to the dish which was amazing. As others have noted, they are a bit greasy, but doesn't taste greasy (not sure if that makes sense). Coffee was really good and they give you a huge mug. My friend got the breakfast tacos and they looked good as well; they were also huge. Would definitely return for a good meal and do a bit of work. Shrimp and grits with a hearty helping of shrimp!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"The food's delicious, the atmosphere is cozy and the beer list is always good. Can't go wrong at Cherrywood- I like the breakfast tacos but the whole menu is spot on",1
Coffee Shop 12,"THIS PLACE IS THE SHIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTT!! Excellent food, helpful baristas, adorable location, and awesome atmosphere. The iced coffee is not too harsh or acidic. V mellow. V good. I like this place a latte.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"4 check-ins Listed in Let's Taco Bout It, Serious Burger Chill spot with a huge patio and the occasional live music. Great place for brunch and on Tuesday nights for stand up comedy. Friendly staff, good food and if your lucky there is nice weather so you can fully enjoy the patio. If not, thats ok! the inside is comfy with lots of art and good smells. El Sol Breakfast Taco",1
Coffee Shop 12,Cozy coffee shop and restaurant. Came here for breakfast at 10am on a Saturday and we just beat the Saturday morning/brunch traffic.,1
Coffee Shop 12,"My local favourite when visiting Austin . Great coffee and interesting food with an artsy vibe I the place . Comfy sofas , and enclosed outdoor area great for children. Live music adds to the ambiance",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This seems to be a popular brunch place... works for families too. They have a good outdoor setting and there's kids running around having a good time.  It wasn't too overwhelming though. They also had some live music outside.  The inside was a little loud and chaotic. I would only go here if it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded and I could sit outside on a nice day.  I had a croissant egg, bacon, cheese sandwich toasted.... it was delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Pretty darn good breakfast. Order at the counter. Live music on weekends. Be prepared to share your breakfast experience with furry friends, and their dogs.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This place is pretty cool.  Their breakfast tacos are really freakin good.  That's all I've had, food wise, and it's all I need.  I've been on a couple of weekend mornings and found it does not get excessively busy, or at least it's big enough to not feel that way.  The outdoor area is great on beautiful days and sometimes they have music for adults and children.  Don't go here if you don't like kids cus the yuppies will horde the Cholula bottles if you do.  Coffee is pretty good, too.  Peace and Love to Cherrywood",1
Coffee Shop 12,My kid loves the Sunday morning kid's shows.  The only thing more amusing than hipster watching at a coffee house is hipster parent watching.  I play a little game trying to find the tot with the most deliberately mismatched clothes.,1

Coffee Shop 12,I loved everything about this place!! food was great and so was the service. they work with your wants and what you don't like. they have lots of vegetarian options and gluten free options.,1
Coffee Shop 12,"I had brunch here today. I'm rounding this up from a 3.5 review because I feel like this place deserves a second chance due to the fact that I might have just been overly picky about my particular dish.  I ordered the sweet potato hash with black tea. The hash was absolutely delicious BUT it was (1) way too oily (2) the eggs were NOT ""poached"" as indicated by the menu, but instead fried over easy. Due to the hash being way too greasy for my liking, I think I might just stick with the salads, smoothies, tea, and coffee the next time I come by.  I did like the atmosphere, beverages, and general diversity of the menu very much so I will be coming back to try everything out again.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"OMG, thee best cinnamon rolls ever!! Very thin layers of crust and sugar and butter and cinnamon. The shrimp and grits are a little greasy, but delicious flavor and creamy cheesy grits. They had live music during brunch, and I loved the atmosphere. Amazing food and very reasonably priced. Biscuits and sausage with gravy Shrimp and grits Cinnamon roll. Completely delicious",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Ambiance- 10/10.  Great staff, excellent food, great coffee... What more can you ask for!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I would have given cherrywood 5 stars if I had not had two terrible experiences with their lattes, they basically tasted like dirty water-- and no I'm not just used to Starbucks lattes that are pure sugar. I've had many lattes from several places and cherrywood doesn't meet my tastebud needs. I will say that their iced coffee is amazing, you don't need to add anything to it! They also have a great selection of pastries and their food menu is great! The atmosphere is my favorite, that's why I keep coming back. They have a large outside patio (note the wifi does not work well outside) Somethings that could change are the hipster baristas attitudes! The guys are awesome, the girls could use a little more smile in their encounters with customers. Who knows maybe it's just me!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This place gives you a LOT of coffee for the price you pay. It is a very popular place (always packed with lots of customers), with a nice ambiance. My latte was great.  If you want to study, this is a great place to come. If you want to brunch, this is still a great place to come!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"One of my favorite places in Austin. Reasonably priced, super attentive & friendly staff, cool interior, and there's always an awesome playlist on when there aren't local music acts performing.  Most importantly,  the food there is great.  The Terra taco is less than $5 and it's one of the biggest breakfast tacos I've had in Austin.  Their grilled cheese is amazing & comes with cucumbers, onions, & tomatoes. I highly recommend switching out a side of chips for a side salad.  You get a giant bowl of greens with avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, & feta and it's only $1.80 extra. Their fries are really good too,  but the salad is pretty hard to compete with. Basically, you get a lot more than what you pay for regardless of what you order.  Love, love, love this place.  I come here on a weekly basis & cannot recommend it enough!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I like this place. It's hardly perfect, and I think that's what I like best about it. It's a slightly chaotic, almost divey (not unhygienic!) sort of place. There is always plenty of seating, it's not overly noisy, a bit dark, and the staff smiles. While they aren't overtly friendly and they are very professional and efficient.  All that gives Cherrywood a personality that I have come to enjoy. It's not pristine, it's not nasty. It's a neighborhood cafe and comes with all the requisite mixture of people, art, and atmosphere to give it its own unique charm.  And to add onto it, the food is good. Solid, fast, and well presented. My burger was juicy and savory and my side salad was delightfully fresh, with ripe slices of smooth avocado on top. Yummy.  Cherrywood is now a central place for me to go for a quick bite to eat, or even just to sit and read while enjoying a smoothie.  Bring a reading lamp though. It is a bit dim in there!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I'm a frequent visitor of Cherrywood and I've come to the conclusion that it's a very hit or miss establishment.  Pros:  In general I love the atmosphere of this place. It's cozy inside and dog friendly outside. The staff is very friendly and easy going.Their club sandwich is massive,  and extremely delicious. The hot chocolate is smooth and delicious. Plus, they make a pretty mean breakfast taco, which is a morning necessity in my book.  Cons: Aside from the hot chocolate, I haven't had many good drinks here. My chai tea was heavily watered down and lacking in flavor and my mocha latte didn't have much of a chocolate flavor. Food wise, there are lots of tasty choices, but a burger is not one of them. My boyfriend and I both got burgers and they tasted sweet rather than savoury. The meat was mushy and I pretty much lost my appetite a few bites in.  Overall, I would recommend Cherrywood if you are looking for a dog friendly place to relax with some coffee or a snack. Medium hot chocolate. Yum!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"This coffee shop embodies the Cherrywood neighborhood's chill vibes. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, occasional live music, delicious menu, all day breakfast and smooth coffee drinks.  My favorites include the luna taco, apple danish, drip coffee and peanut butter smoothies.  Try and make the weekend brunch. The sweet potato hash is awesome.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I was so happy to find this place before we headed out to the track. I knew it was going to be all meh food when we got there so I wanted to get a nice breakfast/lunch in me. I ordered the portabello burger and it was divine. The mushrooms were seasoned perfectly and the fries were great. I rolled out of there, that's for sure.  Coffee and tea were good too, stop by, it's a very comfy place.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Excellent tacos and a perfect place to have Sunday Funday with my hipster friends. I love to sit outside and feed my leftover nachos to the birds that hang out by the garbage. They can get pretty aggressive though so watch out for the poop! I once saw this bearded hipster there, who was so distracted on his smartphone, he totally did not see this bird drop a deuce into his food.  Then he ate it all. Good times!",1
Coffee Shop 12,Nice people working at the counter and the vibe was cool. They had live music playing while we ate tacos outside,1
Coffee Shop 12,"Love this place! Great outdoor space to enjoy the weather and listen to local, live music. The food is good (bar type foods - sandwiches, fries, etc.) and good selection of beers and coffees. The parking lot is really small so be prepared to find a random parking spot throughout the neighborhood and walk a bit :)",1
Coffee Shop 12,"It's 6:34 Am on Sunday. I've been sitting on a cinder block parking spot patiently waiting for Cherrywood to open. The employees starting showing up at 5:30, 6:34 and 6:36Am. It opens at 7.  When the first employee showed up, I waited for a while then politely asked/signed through the door if she would mind if I sat in the courtyard (outside) to read and write with no intention of disrupting their preparation. She gave me the look of death, turned her back and ignored me, walked off.  I've managed CoffeeHouses, restaurants, and worked in the service industry since the age of 14, I'm now 44. A simple smile and a ""I'm sorry sir will be open in just a few minutes would suffice"" but NOPE. This is the new Austin. I've lived here since 1999.  Then another gentleman came to work. I asked him would he mind if I sat in the courtyard to write. I even offered to help carry in the pastries left at the front door. Again, he said can't do that. He was a bit nicer but, Nope, against policy. I replied back, no worries, I'll just sit here on this cinder block parking brick, with my butt hurting until you are open for business. It was 6:34AM.  I understand anything can happen to anyone at any time. I guess I look harmful to them although I'm here almost everyday. Austin used to be friendly, service was friendly, I know it's a new world we live in. It's a shame because those days are gone.  Oh well, the situation is over. I've eaten here countless times and after this I will not be back. if you like feeling you're an inconvenience by all means come here. If not, do yourself a favor and find a happier place, where they are glad to see you and serve you.",0

Coffee Shop 12,"Came here for Sunday brunch. Very cool spot to hang out. There was live music outside in the large outdoor patio. Lots of seating. Parking was a bit tough, ended up parking at the cleaners next door.  We had the eggs Benedict, it was cooked perfectly and it was wonderful. My niece and friend had the American breakfast and biscuits and gravy. Everything was fantastic.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"The best coffee shop that I've tried in Austin so far. I have a new habit developing where I wake up on weekends and go hike/ run a trail and then try a new place.  I've been to Cherry Wood for lunch and I was shocked at how good their food was. I was skeptical at first, and I was expecting mediocre cafeteria style food. That's not what you get at all.  Their burgers are delicious and I love their selection and range of food and drinks. Its a great size and the patio seating is cool for a nice meal outdoors. The only small problem for me is their location. It far from my house, but I can deal.",1
Coffee Shop 12,"Great place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee or a just a beer! Seriously good food with plenty of gluten free options too. The burger is fantastic. The beer selection is unique and current. And the patio at night sparkles with lightening bugs. Couldn't ask for a better everything restaurant. My new favorite place for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 12,"I would've given 5 stars but all of the staff seemed very disinterested and unsmiling. The coffee was fabulous, breakfast tacos were outrageously good (our fave was the pork n poblano with feta), and pastries from Russells were divine (especially the blueberry scone)! And of course the patio is so charming with the palm trees and lights and stage. The staff seemed extremely tired or bored, like the customers were all an annoyance. This was true for everyone we encountered, from the cashier to the counter help to the last bidding tables. But we will definitely be back for the great food, coffee, and atmosphere.",1

Coffee Shop 12,"Great food and good coffee in a classic Austin vibe. I've been coming to Cherrywood for years, and have experienced the hit-or-miss service that's ubiquitous in Austin coffee shops. What keeps me coming back is the variety (and deliciousness) of the food, including plenty of gluten free options, and the solid (if somewhat uninsipired) coffee. Earlier this week I had an hour wait for 2 tacos, which turned out to be quite tasty but I could've done without the mixup. Today I went in and the cashier remembered my issue and comped my coffee. Redemption! Even though the Americano I'm sipping is only so-so (I've had better...... but I've definitely had worse!), it's this kind of courtesy and consideration that makes me love this place. The patio is perfect, and there are plenty of seats inside for comfortable dining/drinking year round. I use this as my meeting place for offsite work meetings, and have always been able to hold productive conversations with colleagues. It's one of my favorite study spots, too. Oh, and it's my go-to for meeting up with friends whenever we need a landing spot to relax and connect. Easy to get to, reasonable street parking, competitive prices, good food, (mostly) good service. Bring it on down to Cherrywood, y'all!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"I like my coffee to be basically melted ice cream. I am the last person you should be getting coffee advice from, so this review is for the rest of the 99% who aren't coffee snobs.  The iced turbo is so so so good. I wish they had it in an extra large. And can we talk about their crushed ice? The absolute best in keeping your drink ice cold. So addicting and the service is fast so you don't have to break a sweat waiting outside even in the miserable Texas heat. Thumbs up!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Get the belgian bomber. boom.  Jo's Coffee is not only known for their ""I love you so much"" graffiti on the side, but also their turbo iced coffee... but if you're watching the sugar intake or don't like your drinks on the sweet side, ask for the belgian bomber! They make a milder version (half the sweetness, I believe) of the turbo.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"This place must add illegal addictive substances to their Iced Turbo and coffee because I am seriously hooked! Anytime I am in South Austin I have to stop in for a fix. I love sitting in their outdoor section to chat, drink, relax people watch - but when I do, I always end up drinking two Iced Turbos. The first time I went and ordered one, I regretted it instantly when I took my first sip - ALWAYS GET TWO!  Love their coffee, love their iced turbo - love this place!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Perfect place to stop for a pick me up when shopping on Congress Avenue.  The coffee shop is right on the street and we walked to the window and ordered. I opted for their signature drink the ""Iced Turbo"" ... at this time I was hitting my ""it's been a long day wall and I'm acting like a bitch for no reason"".... thankfully the iced turbo not only was delicious it perked me up and got me back to my normal self.  So thank you Jo's!  Another cool thing about Jo's is that they have a cute outdoor seating area where you can hang out and take a break from your busy day.  If you're from out of town like me make sure you get a picture in front of Austin's famous ""I love you so much"" mural.  Austin trip completed.",1

Coffee Shop 34,"Couldn't find a Starbucks, but I'm glad we didn't!  Strolling down the sidewalk of South Congress, this discovery is my go-to coffee spot when I'm ever in the area again. I had the latte and it had a great amount of coffee (not too sweet like at SB).  Atmosphere is casual, quick, and patio-style. It reminds me of Bruxie in Orange County, CA.  I dig it a lot and will be back again.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"This place was super fun. It has the famous writing on the side of the building and a walk up order station outside. The location is in the middle of SoCo so a lot is happening when you go by this place. The team is super nice and they make orders very quick. There is a cute outside seating area where you can relax, drink your coffee, and people watch as the bustle goes by on Congress. Definitely check this place out for the experience.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Shopping in South Congress was awesome, but we needed a pick me up. ""Where's the coffee?"" We asked. Local patron immediately said try Joe's. But make sure you get the TURBO. And so we did... Best decision of the day! You'll be tempted to get the less sweet version (Belgian Bomber)...DON'T. Trust them when they say it's their signature. Service was fantastic! We'll be back. The ""TURBO""!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"3 check-ins I fell in love with Jo's coffee the minute I laid eyes on the description of the Iced Turbo and its less intense cousin, the Belgian Bomber. Coffee and espresso with a parade of mocha-y flavors for added measure. They whip drinks up fast at Jo's, too; no time for lolly gagging there.  I was really close to filling up a ten-drink punch card during my seven-day stay in Austin...that tells you how much I enjoyed their caffeinated beverages. I was tempted to try their bfast tacos and pastries, but the liquid treats were enough to satiate my morning cravings!  The ""I love you so much"" mural is an Austin staple that makes every pit stop bring a smile to your face no matter your mood. Belgian Bomber (left) and soy vanilla latte (right).",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Great service and strong coffee. What more can you ask for? I love that you're able to smell the aroma of coffee down the block regardless of which way you come. Just follow your nose, it will steer you in the right direction!  Stopped by Jo's after a morning yoga class for a much needed pick-me-up before the day started. There were the typical varieties of hot coffees, but I really liked their different cold brew options (which I went back for later!) Because I was trying to get caffeine in my system as fast as possible, I ordered a small, soy latte with an add shot and it did just the trick.  They have a lot of covered outdoor seating, so finding a table is never difficult. It's actually a super nice place to hang out and people watch, or just put your nose in a book if you have some studying to do.  Jo's is also the spot you'll find the tagged ""I love you so much..."" scribbled on the wall. Ask for the story, it's cute and I'm glad they kept it up. So regardless - if you're in Austin, you need to go to Jo's! Outdoor seating. Iced versions. Menu",1
Coffee Shop 34,I have a gluten allergy and read the reviews on Yelp so had to try this! I was worried because it's our first time in Austin and did not want to get sick! And this was amazing! I had the gluten free lavender fig pop tart and the Kambucha. It was so fresh and sweet. Delicious!  I highly recommend them for gluten free people!,1
Coffee Shop 34,"Famous for their ""I love you so much"" sign. And yessss I love you so much.... Coffee. Hahaha.  Their friendly and fast.  Got the Belgian Bomber. It was perfect for my taste buds since I take my coffee with no sugar. It uses half the turbo mix and adds more iced coffee. For me it was perfectly sweetened with a good enough amount of cream and milk. Now you can't really customize your turbo since it is pretty mixed. They also use stumptown coffee. Nommm.  The tacos, oh so pequeno. But now after eating the black bean, avocado, and pico taco on wheat was perfect. The creamy green sauce was soooo good! My friends got the eggs and papas taco and they said that was good. Belgian bomber",1
Coffee Shop 34,"My friends and I were looking for some coffee and Jo's was the first place we passed walking in soco. They're known for their iced turbo drink but upon reading the description I was worried it might be too sweet for me with the hazelnut, chocolate and cream so I decided to try it's little brother the belgian bomber.  Yum! You can still taste the creaminess from the iced turbo but the added iced coffee kicks the caffeine up a notch. A great alternative for those not wanting too sugary of a drink. Back in California I'm used to my coffee being dark and strong so this was an experience. I'm so glad we decided to stop here. The line was not long and their turn around time for drink orders is short.  Of course you can't forget about the famous wall as well. Nice spot for an engagement shoot.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Really enjoyed the coffee, one of the best bean and cheese tacos I've ever had. Wish they had breakfast tacos longer throughout the day. Also wish they had a larger iced coffee size to feed my coffee addiction! Not a fan of the turbo, way too sweet.",1

Coffee Shop 34,"I'm here nearly every weekend.  Bomber is the reason to go.  They recently tried to take their taco making in-house and it was a big mistake.  Although I'm sure they upped their margins, the new ones are bad.  I don't mean bad in comparison to Tacodeli(their previous supplier), I mean like some of the worst around.  No more tacos for me.  Back to the cinnamon roll I guess..",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Happy to find some pretty amazing tacos at Jo's on my first visit.  Finding decent sandwiches at a place known for coffee is one thing, but finding great pulled pork tacos is another thing altogether.  Not sure where they source the meat but the folks are Jo's make their own barbeque sauce--sweet and smoky with a little tang--and fresh cabbage slaw and the tortillas come from El Milagros.    Love the two outdoor seating areas, one with a counter and stools facing Congress and another with a larger canopy covered patio behind it.  Especially, nice for fair weather days.

I ordered the Belgian Bomber, which by the way, is sweet enough for you. I promise. And I loved it.  I don't typically order milky, chocolate-y coffee, but this was a perfect balance and very potent. Just what I needed. It was busy, but my coffee was out in a flash. I was impressed...especially for somewhere I assume to be very tourist-y. Would definitely try it again next time I'm in town.",1

And, of course, to take pictures by the famous ""i love you so much"" sign like proper tourists.  The line gets long, both for the coffee and the sign, but people who go here seemed friendly -- people offered their photography skills to the other patrons without being asked and are happy to have friendly chats while waiting for their turn to order. The baristas were also quite efficient and kept the line moving fast. As we just ordered to go, the whole visit lasted about 15 minutes from getting in line to taking said tourist pictures to ordering our drink to walking back to our car.  They looked to be a good place to actually sit down and do some people watching. So if you have time, I would suggest you do what we were unable to do. The Iced Turbo was a bit too sweet for my liking, but as it was my first, I am sure I could have asked my pleasant barista to scale back on the sugar. The coffee I was able to taste underneath all the sugar was good.  If Jo's were in my neighborhood, I could easily myself choosing them as my the spot to do some unwinding and people watching.",1

Here's the deal: I'm not much for coffee but I have to hang out in coffee shops as I work remotely and need to take meetings. So Jo's actual coffee could be totally terrible (although I doubt it.)  What I'm most interested in highlighting is the ambiiiaaaaaance of Jo's. All manner of people are talking, sipping, hanging, bonding, whispering, dating, working, sight-seeing. It's like a cultural hub - a mecca of sorts for anyone and everyone. They've got live tunes on Sundays, they're dog friendly, they're on South Congress and have been for some time. When your work day has ended and you need a little patio time, just head on over to San Jose for a michelada.  Jo's Coffee doesn't need my review - I think most people get it - but if you've never been, take an hour, grab a Turbo and nestle in among the humanity.

I would highly recommend their seasonal special drinks, but you can never go wrong with their Belgian bomber or vanilla latte. I've been recently switching to just shots of espresso and they are pretty tasty as well.  Sometimes in the morning the lines are a bit long, and on a cold/hot day sitting outside can be uncomfortable. But other than that, I have no complaints about Jo's coffee shop.  If you are in SoCo and looking for a quick cup of coffee, or something a bit more fancy, I'd give them a try. Just be careful to not trip over all the teenyboppers and faux hispters taking photos in front of the ""I love you"" graffiti wall. That can be a little annoying, but oh well, it is Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 34,Great place to grab a convenient cup in the morning when on Congress. The basic coffee is superb as is the people watching,1
Coffee Shop 34,"I love this little stand.  The coffee and tea are great!  Get a turbo.  Or if coffee isn't your thing, any of the Palmer teas are delicious, especially in this crazy Texas heat.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"The iced turbo coffee is really good and definitely a good way to start my day. The coffee was a little bit more expensive than I like but it makes sense since it is a tourist attraction. Nonetheless, really good coffee at a really chill location.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"One word, yum! A great afternoon pick me up on a hot day! I got the Iced Turbo and my boyfriend got the Belgium Bomber. Before we left, we obviously had to take a photo with the ""i love you so much"" wall.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"2 check-ins This place is very convenient if you are staying at the Hotel San Jose. I had coffees and Americanos every day of my visit. They are pretty well organized, although when it's busy, many people hover around the pickup window and twice I had someone else grab my drink, which was eventually rectified. Note, if the weather is lousy, there is NO inside, unless they hire you. Next time I'm in town, I'll be there.",1
Coffee Shop 34,Great location with a lot of out door seating. Got an iced coffee and sat on the bench facing congress ave and people watched. Didn't get food but they have taco deli tacos which is a big plus! Great place to come alone or with friends.,1
Coffee Shop 34,"I'd heard of Jo's prior to visiting Austin & I wasn't disappointed. Great service, coffee & location. It's a great place if your in a hurry, I was surprised how fast their service was & if your not in a hurry they have plenty of places to sit down & enjoy your coffee.  We had the iced turbo & would definitely order it again. Street view Iced turbo",1
Coffee Shop 34,"I ordered two tacos - should be called appetizer burritos, with a weird-tasting filling.  The iced coffee drink was nice, however.",0
Coffee Shop 34,"Most people visit Jo's, not for their coffee, but for the obligatory photo-op with the ""I love you so much"" mural that is painted on the side of their building. Twenty poses and pictures later, you can't help but grab a quick cup of coffee. It is delicious!!! The staff are friendly and more than willing to help you find the drink that most suits your style. Admittedly, it is a little pricey, but no more than you'd spend at Starbucks! This is a must go-to place in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 34,First timer! Went with the popular choice of an iced turbo. It was a great choice. I did not need to add anything else. They have a covered patio next to their store front. You need to drive around to find parking during the Saturday noon time.,1
Coffee Shop 34,"If you're gonna take a picture next to the crappy hipster graffiti on the side, at least buy a cup of coffee. It's good. Trust me.",1
Coffee Shop 34,Always a pleasure stopping here while taking a stroll down Congress. The staff is friendly and the coffee is good. That enough for me. Yes there is often a line but you are on Congress .,1
Coffee Shop 34,"This is the most laid back little shop I have been to in such a long time.  I came here to take a picture next to the famous mural of theirs, but I will come back for the coffee and the people. I do want to add that it was very touching to see the Pulse Orlando victims pictures outside of Jo's. So meaningful to see this. They have gained a customer for life.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"A good morning spot for a sweet pick-me-up and watching the day from the outdoor bar.  Lines can snake around the corner, but they move fast.  Come here if you're in the area and need a quick jolt of caffeine.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Cool little coffee shop. You order right from the sidewalk.  It too cold to try their turbo ice drink. But it sounds cool. The guy is super nice, like an awesome barista, will make it anyway you want your coffee. (My friends were being complicated ) but he had a smile on his face!  Cool little concept. If only they had white chocolate, I'd rate it higher. :) 4.5 stars",1
Coffee Shop 34,"With the famous ""I love you so much"" mural and their yummy coffee, no wonder this place is a tourist attraction!  Widow maker is a seasonal drink. It's mint mocha which equates to Christmas in a cup! Haha  They're special concoction is their iced turbo - espresso latte mocha hazelnut and cream, or something to that effect. Delicious but a little too sweet for me to drink even a whole small cup by myself! So share with someone! :) Widow maker. Seasonal beverage. Mint mocha. Christmas in a cup. Enough said.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"2 check-ins The Belgium Bomber is delicious!!!! This place is great and centrally located on Congress Ave. Get the breakfast tacos while you can at this place too.  There is lots of outdoor seating and dogs are totally welcome. Don't forget to take your pic next to the I love you so much mural on the side of the building, which is where the line is usually wrapped around.  Wish there was one of these in my hometown. Love the service and the view that it provides. Occasionally there is live music playing there too. So its nice to grab a coffee and a snack and kick back and enjoy the vibes that Jo's provides. A must try when in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Just ignore the rats and birds!  Really cute spot and one of my first Austin experiences. The coffee is fantastic and so is the food. The breakfast tacos are awesome and go great with a coffee. Not too sure what to say about this place, since it has 400+ reviews.  Nonetheless, if you're not from around here, check this one out. Great coffee. Also, the tacos are surprisingly good! I really recommend the potato / cheese / egg taco. Get two!  The downside is the parking, so be on the lookout for a spot. Another thing that might bother you is what lurks beneath the floorboards... unless those are hamsters on steroids... As for the birds, guard your food.  Jo's Coffee is fantastic. Worth the visit and hype!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Love the drinks and the atmosphere here. I waited out a knock down, drag out rainstorm one afternoon with an Arnold Palmer and a good book. Can get a little busy with the people taking pictures of the ""I love you so much"" graffiti, but a great place to stop and people watch for locals and tourists alike. Plus, a good kickoff to shopping on SoCo!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"I've had the Belgian Bomber, and Pumpkin Latte, various flavored lattes, and their wintermint latte at this point.  Everything I'd tried has been absolutely amazing. Never too sweet- I like sweet lattes but nothing extreme, and their level is perfect for me. Smoooooth and amazing. I go anytime before a Saturday shift (once or twice a month) or a closing shift, and I am never let down. They also have a great selection of pastries from Quack's.  Ughhh I love Jo's. I reallyyyy wish it wasn't on SoCo, so I could go MORE often. Honestly, a great place for coffee if you're a local or visiting- don't think the wall hype is all there is to Jo's!",1
Coffee Shop 34,Fantastic Pumpkin Spice Latte!! Not super sweet like Starbucks. It has a rich coffee flavor with delicious hints of pumpkin. Put me right in the fall spirit!  Their regular lattes are also delicious and automatically come with 2 shots of espresso- which is AWESOME because my husband and I always have to pay extra for an additional shot.  This place is iconic and their coffee lives up to their name. Famous Jo's graffiti,1
Coffee Shop 34,"Iconic coffee place in Austin. Right in south congress. Has he iconic ""I love you so much"" wall. It was one of the first places my sister took me when I was visiting her in Austin. Good coffee! Def worth a stop on anyone's trip to Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 34,"Great cofee, fun staff, and a great location.  We each tried the Iced Turbo and Belgium Bomber. We were not disappointed! I can not wait to go back",1
Coffee Shop 34,Got the Belgium bomber and turbo. I like the less sweet version (Belgium bomber) more but a mixture of the two would be nice too! It looked like there was a long line so we almost went to Starbucks instead but the long line was for those wanting to take a photo in front of the wall painting on the side. Parking is terrible!,1
Coffee Shop 34,"4 check-ins Perfect place to chill, casually work, and enjoy outdoor weather. I had the cold-brew iced coffee which was excellent.  Kind service and prompt, which goes a long way. Two thumbs up!",1
Coffee Shop 34,The vanilla latte is the bomb. It is nice and smooth and not real sweet.  The big brand coffee shops have nothing on Jo's.  The taco deli tacos are good too.,1
Coffee Shop 4,"Busy place! It has to be good if it's survived for 15 years, right?  1. The Coffe. The iced American is one of the best I've ever had (I know my coffee, former Barista here). The espresso is smooth, low acidity, with a natural hint of hazelnut. My wife got the chai and highly recommends that as well!  2. Breakfast is really good!!! This is the best I've ever had for Tex-Mex breakfast food. My wife got the Migas plate, I got the Rancheros. Their use of fresh ingredients is obvious, and much appreciated. Homemade salsa? It tastes like it. To me, fresh cilantro is the make-or-break for good Tex-Mex and they're not afraid of it here! Highly recommend! Cute girls. The upstairs kitchen and order station. More booths to the left, more tables behind the window.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Delicious food and a great atmosphere. You walk in and place your order at the counter. Fore warning: they no longer do lunch tacos. Service is fast and reasonably priced for the area, so it's a great spot for business professionals on a quick lunch break. The chipotle chicken quesadilla is absolutely delicious and comes with rice, beans, and salsa.  The seating is all downstairs and quite spacious, as well as a few outside tables. Funky artwork and a huge desert mural encompass the walls.  Never had their breakfast but dying to try it. Also, make sure you get there early enough because they close at 2:30 daily. You enter into a little kitchen with an ordering counter, then you go down the stairs for seating. Hence the underground part ha",1
Coffee Shop 4,"A delightful find in a city of delightful finds.  Don't let the tiny storefront fool you - most of their seating is downstairs (the clue is in the title).  Congenial service, and lovely touches in the menu abound.  The Caribbean (French) toast was particularly good, with baked drunken bananas.  The Austin Eggs Benedict is a savory treat.    A bit of a wait on a rainy day (a line, no check-in) was offset by friendly folks in line and a manager making sure everyone was dry under their tent.    Recommended!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Ended up here for brunch around 11am on a Saturday because there was not a wait (we got the last available table). Had never been before because I tend to avoid places around campus when classes are in session and especially during home football games. But, we were in desperate need of sustenance and caffeine so we came in blind.  I definitely dig the quirky vibe and decor here and the ""underground"" is the very small seating area down some steps from the entrance. There are some great art pieces (my favs being the Trump/Clinton as clowns and the rhino) that made my brunch a little more enjoyable because they brought a smile to my face.  The staff here were absolutely awesome! The host/cashier especially. I had called ahead to find out the wait time and he was very kind to tell me there was none at the moment, but that could change quickly. We were sat quickly and our orders were taken promptly.  They have a bottomless cup of decent coffee and their Austin benedict (their most popular dish we were told) was on point. The accompanying bfast taters were hit and miss for texture, but were flavorful. A friend got the Toad in the Hole that was surprisingly delish! The pesto in it was also on point!  We left very full and satisfied and w/tax and tip for just under $20, it was a decent brunch find in the UT/Dwntwn area. Also, we lucked out and got a street parking spot right in front, but there were several other open street parking spots along 17th as well. Toad in the hole The Austin benedict My fav piece of all!

Coffee Shop 4,"Wow I would give Arturo's 10 stars if I could, I was not expecting such an amazing brunch when I left the house this morning and ended up here after a quick Yelp search. I am SO glad we gave their brunch menu a try!  When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess and instructed to wait outside at the picnic tables, thankfully we grabbed iced Americanos to cool us down while we waited. Once our table was ready, we walked downstairs to the dining room which is literally underground. Such a cool setting!  As for the food, holy this was the pinnacle of all breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. We both ordered the western melt and added bacon on, because who doesn't love bacon? The sandwich comes out open faced and is probably best eaten with a fork and knife. I cannot say enough about all of the flavors on the sandwich and how well they worked together. I'm not usually a hollandaise fan, and yet I was very impressed with the flavor of this one. The home fries it was served with also had a great flavor too!  Service was great and our waiter was more than happy to provide suggestions and ask for feedback. We also didn't have to wait very long for our food despite the warning on the menu that a smaller kitchen means food may take a bit longer. I can't believe I've lived in Austin for 4 years and had never been in, I would suggest Arturo's to anyone and everyone. cannot wait to return in the future! The western melt with bacon",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Pretty tasty! I'm a big eater though, and the portions were not quite enough to satiate my appetite. Staff was very friendly, and dog friendly! ;)",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Arturo's is a local breakfast/ brunch spot in Austin, TX. It is pretty hidden, so you have to pay attention when you're trying to find it, at least it was hard for us non locals.  We came in and you order from the front counter, the space is small, but the have a very large seating area downstairs with gorgeous local artwork and plenty of seating. We came early at about 8 am on a Friday, but it was getting pretty crowded by the time we left.  The guy up front was SO NICE. He explained everything to us and had some great suggestions for us on the menu.  I ordered a latte as well and they have a good selection of milk alternatives, I had mine made with almond milk and it was delicious.  We ordered the migas and the huevos rancheros. Both were amazing, the flavors were so fresh and the salsa was AMAZING, it was the perfect amount of spicy and clearly freshly made.  We loved it and it's a great spot to try if you're a local or out of towners like us :) Gorgeous artwork by local artists. Dining area, very spacious, lots of seats Huevos rancheros, yum!!

Coffee Shop 4,"Looking for brunch on a Saturday morning, browsed through the pictures and it was about to open. Seated right away for 7 people!  Ordered 2 carafes of mimosas which actually were really good... Usually brunch mimosas taste like straight OJ or cheap champagne but these were just right. The table ended up ordering Texas in a basket, Diablo, French toast! Everything was amazing! Great twist on brunch and will definitely be coming back!!! Diablo! Has a bit of a kick but amazing! Texas in a basket! Bread is amazing!",1

I said no, they just treat us like we are here. See you next Saturday. Daddy Daughter Saturday brunch. This just might have to be our new spot.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Austin, you sly devil. You have captured my bell- err my heart again! As usual, I see tacos and breakfast and my heart pumps a little faster. We got to Arturo's at 1050 and were told that breakfast was served until 1100. Yasss! Made it under the wire.  We both got the workx tacos, which are their most popular item, and coffee/soda. We then descended into the underground space..what? Did you think the name was a pun? It is literal. We had a number and set it down on the table. Our tacos arrived promptly.  What can I really say other than OMG this cheese-jalapeño-whateverelseisinit combo was clearly their best seller for good reason!! Melty, seasoned very well and served pipping hot. It's just another reason I love Austin so much.  Good job Arturo's. Way to keep Austin weird! The worx tacos",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Had high hopes for Arturo's based on the great reviews but sadly was disappointed with the long grueling wait combined with mediocre food.  Came here on a Saturday for brunch. There was no wait and and we were quickly seated inside. Our server took a while to get to us.  We ordered quickly since we were super hungry. Then comes the long wait for food, what seemed like forever was in reality 45 minutes - which is pretty long in my opinion. However they do have a note in the menu ""Small Kitchen + Yummy Food = Longer Wait""  The food was just a plain OK. The popular Austin Benedict had some good hollandaise sauce but the english muffin was too toasted/hard with some burnt parts (couldn't even cut through) and the poached egg was overcooked. And the home fries were rock cold. The Caribbean toast had a yummy caramel sauce complemented with grilled bananas and pecans. The toast was 1/2 french toast and 1/2 regular toast. Wished it was more like a french toast, I would have enjoyed it more.  Overall the experience was just A-OK. The wait was just too long when it wasn't even that busy. See all photos from Brenda L. for Arturo's Underground Cafe",0
Coffee Shop 4,"We stopped here for a quick breakfast before checking out the Bullock Museum(its in walking distance). The cashier was super friendly and it wasn't too crowded on a Monday mid-morning. The art inside is so cute and lowkey it makes you feel like you're in someones well decorated basement.  They had free ice water at the front which was much appreciated as the temperatures were starting to climb outside. We sat for probably about 10 mins and then our food arrived. I had chorizo and eggs and my boyfriend got the huevos rancheros. It was all so delicious and filled us up as we started our day. The prices were reasonable, we added a mimosa and the total came to about 25$.  Would definitely return here if in the area again.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I came here on a Saturday for brunch and there was a wait but it went by pretty quickly. There were some spots available outside but it was too windy and a tad bit chilly so we decided to just wait a bit longer to get a table inside.  I was surprised that they didn't seat us earlier because when we walked in there were at least 5 empty tables but the wait wasn't horrendous so it's okay.  I decided to order the latte and the Caribbean French toast and a side of eggs. I didn't expect the latte to be so bitter. I had to add 3 packets of sugar before I liked it. The Caribbean French toast was delicious!! It was a huge portion so definitely it. The gave large thick slices of bread which definitely made the French toast better. There were pecans and bananas on top, but the sauce was definitely the best part: dark caramel rum.I totally recommend getting the French toast!!  Overall I'm kind of sad that I tried this place after I graduated so it's more difficult to try other items on the menu when I'm not living in Austin anymore. However, next time, this will definitely be on the list of places to visit again. Latte Caribbean french toast",1
Coffee Shop 4,"This place wasn't wowza but I did enjoy my breakfast here. The wait is kind of long for food, about 30 mins, and parking is limited to pay to parks.  I ordered a vanilla latte with the eggs in the basket. I love runny eggs and I love tasty bread. So yes it was quite enjoyable. I really enjoyed the jalepeno cheddar bread. Def not on the spicy side so don't be afraid to order. The potatoes were pretty mediocre and so was the coffee. Like I said, it's good but not wow. It's def on the pricey side for breakfast. $40 for 2 entrees and 2 coffees. Egg in a basket",1
Coffee Shop 4,"2 check-ins I haven't lived here very long, and I haven't tried many other breakfast places, but I don't think I want to because the food here is just amazing. I've gotten the Diablo which is a must-have. Nothing beats jalapeno cheese bread incorporated into a breakfast item. Another FIRE item is the Texas Eggs In A Basket (now called the Toad I believe. Cut into the jalapeno cheese bread and you'll find a perfectly runny egg along with pesto. The wait times are long, but what do you expect from a place that has such incredible food. Can't wait to go back! Most amazing breakfast item",1
Coffee Shop 4,"This was a gre hearty brunch! We got the Austin eggs Benedict, the toad in a hole with a side of hollandaise sauce, and the veggie Benedict with a side of bacon.

Coffee Shop 4,"Sooooooooo, this is my story.... After church we decide to eat out for brunch. Our normal place wasn't a go, so we looked in Yelp and found Arturo's. 4 stars and one dollar sign, bet, we headed out. It took us less than 10mins to get there and parking was fairly easy since it was Sunday. Street parking was free. As we turned the corner, BAM...... A line. So we got in line and waited in the shade and drank free chilled water. Suggestion, add some oranges or cucumber to the water. Thanks. 20mins I. We were seated only because 2 parties in front of us decided to leave, sweeeet. When we were seated we noticed the place was small and quaint. The a/c was on but it didn't get cold, still better than outside. There was a fly that bothered us throughout our meal but we got over it. Marisa our waitress was very polite. I got the Austin and hubby got the French toast. Very happy with our choices. We will try something diff if we come back but i will suggest this place to others. Hidden Austin Gem.

Coffee Shop 4,"Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday morning while visiting Austin. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table and the crowd waiting outside kept growing and growing. While waiting one can help themselves to some coffee - nice touch.  Once we were seated we were promptly greeted and served. The waitress was attentive and very nice. Drinks were always full.  My husband had the western melt and completely cleaned his plate, so a win I guess. He did comment on how good the hollandaise sauce was. I had the Texas eggs in a basket,  something we often make at home, so it was nice to find in a restaurant. I was worried the jalapeño bread wouldn't be good, but the flavor is not overpowering at all. The egg yolks were perfectly runny, but the whites were still too raw for my liking. The bread was perfectly toasty and the pesto delicious! Would certainly order that again. Both dishes came with the potatoes, which were well seasoned. Western melt Texas eggs in a basket!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"14 check-ins You'll be hard pressed to find a better sandwich in the nearby vicinity. They serve hot flavorful sandwiches with a side of ruffles (you can upgrade to rice and beans for a couple dollars more).  Usually, I have a hard time deciding between the smoked ham and cheddar versus the Thai grilled chicken. Both are served piping-hot and are under $10. If i's your first time, try the Thai, it's different and probably their most popular in sandwich or salad form.  Don't be fooled by the six or so tables outside, there are plenty places to sit inside down in the lower level in the cool downstairs. It's a fast casual restaurant, so you usually don't have to wait too long for your food.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"We were immediately smitten when we got to the door -- the patio was bustling and the entrance decor provoked images of a wild, secret, garden. The interior was just as delightful featuring brightly colored walls and paintings from a local artist.  The spot was bustling which we took as a good sign! We stood in line to order our food and counted our lucky starts when we were able to find a table to fit our group of six. That was when things started going down hill.  The food runner was utterly confused and brought out wrong order after wrong order -- which is fine, we've all been there except he was positively snarky about the whole situation. While he was auctioning food off, he actually used his fingers to pick up the top of our quesadilla to announce that it was chicken. It was STILL the wrong order but who would want to eat here after such blatant broken sanitary rules. He finally decided to take our order again but for some reason did not write it down so he forgot it immediately. He came back to write it down but still had the same snarky tone. We eventually were able to order from the front counter who in their defense was gracious as can be.  After that debacle, our food came out but by that time half of our group was pretty hangry so it was hard to enjoy. I'd definitely give this place another try, especially because it looks like a local favorite but based on our experience it was a meh.",0
Coffee Shop 4,Great food. Haven't had creative breakfast before and absolutely loved it very well done. Short wait on a Saturday morning around 11:15. I had the Marcos Benedict and highly recommend it.,1
Coffee Shop 4,"Great place, great vibes. Only complaint is that the Thai veggie sandwich is mildly disgusting. I guess it's my fault for ordering it, but imo it just does not work well. It's Thai veggies, sesame ginger dressing, normal sandwich type lettuce and tomato, mayonnaise, mozzarella, all on a soggy wheat sub. It was pretty gross. But other menu items are a lot better and Arturo's on whole is awesome!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 4,What a cute spot for your brunching needs!! We got here right around 11 in the morning on a Sunday and the morning crowd hadn't showed up yet so it was perfect and we got seated quickly. I ordered the Texas Eggs in a Basket and Mike ordered the Caribbean French Toast. My order was so freakin' good -- jalapeno cheddar toast filled with over easy eggs and a shmear of pesto... YUM!! The side of bacon was super crispy -- just the way I like it. Mike's French toast was equally as delicious -- the rum sauce was just amazing!! When we went upstairs to pay our bill -- we were given complimentary chocolate chip cookies!! Get here early because when we were leaving -- they had a line out the door! We'll definitely come back when we're in town again -- I have to try one of the Benedict dishes!!,1
Coffee Shop 4,"Love this place! Wonderfully hidden and authentic. Very cute place that serves great food. It's that simple. No pretension.  Food portions are pretty large, I could have shared. Everything was delicious and service was wonderful. It's a small place though so the wait for brunch can be long. If you don't mind sitting outside you can skip the line and seat yourself. Nobody seems to know that. Ask questions people! Don't just mindlessly join the end of a line.",1

Coffee Shop 4,"I love this place! Really cool, funky decor in a place that screams TEXAS! It's a very casual spot, you order from the counter and they bring your order to you. Huge selection of tacos; everything from potato to chorizo, but I opted for my go-to brekky, huevos rancheros. It's served with black beans and great, crispy potatoes. The homemade salsa was Da Bomb! After destroying this plate of yum and taking down 4 coffees (I ordered the bottomless,) I'm ready to tackle the world! Btw, I got out of there for $12. ¡Muy bien!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I've been in Austin quite a bit recently and ate at Arturo's instead of at my hotel. Fairly straightforward egg sandwiches and breakfast tacos. Coffee and espresso options are decent. During the week, there is plenty of seating in their downstairs area. Would gladly grab breakfast from them again.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Brunch at Arturo's!  Spent years by UT campus and didn't know about Arturo's despite being only a few blocks away.  Lucky to have friends who are better at scoping out these hidden gems than I am!  Surprisingly, this is my first restaurant that specializes in breakfast but doesn't serve pancakes.  But my comfort zone!  Alas, the responsibility of a Yelper/foodie is to try new things, I guessssss.  Walking in, this place is very small.  Therefore, if you're coming in during the breakfast/lunch rush hour and don't have a reservation, you may be waiting for a while.  And if you are, you'll be waiting outside, so be sure to prep for the weather!  Sitting down, it feels like every table is organized to take up any nook and cranny of the establishment.  You'll hear everything, see everything, and most importantly, smell everything.  Is it intimate?  Not very.  But is it fun?  Mmm yes.  Like almost half of the party I was with, I ordered the Texas Eggs in a Basket.  Hey, I remember trying to make something like this at home!  This dish is one of their specialties and you can definitely tell.  Cutting into the toast revealed a perfect golden river of egg yolk over easy.  The pesto was a delicious addition and the Jalapeno Cheese bread provided a nice little kick.  The Eggs in a Basket, however, is a pretty heavy dish, and my stomach and palate was saturated only midway through.  The potatoes tasted good as well but was a bit crunchy for my taste.  I would definitely recommend this dish, but I would probably try something else next time.  Very interested in their Eggs Benedict.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly, but was very absent in terms of getting us refills.  A lot of plates were dropped and shatter that day, but the entire environment along with all the employees were super lively. Texas Eggs in a Blanket",1
Coffee Shop 4,"So, thanks to yelp we found this place and it didn't disappoint. From the cold brew coffee to the carafe of mimosas the Diablo eggs did not disappoint.

BTW I would have included a photo of our food but we devoured it before I could get my phone out to take one!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Listed in Austin, TX (ATX) Arturo's is a cute and small cafe with the best little menu. Although it's quite a simple place, the food tasted great.  I had the Bueno which is an egg scramble with chorizo and sausage, served with potatoes, flour tortillas and salsa.  My friends had the Texas eggs in a basket which also looked really delicious.  The prices are moderate!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"We came in on a business trip to Austin and were looking for a breakfast place for our day off. It was important that we find a good place given its our one day off! After reading some reviews we chose to give Arturos a try.  They opened at 10am (sat) and they were instantly flooded with patrons. We were seated really quickly and brought coffee. I decided to go for the chorizo eggs benny, and my friend got a scrambled egg plate. The atmosphere was awesome, they aren't kidding when they named it the ""underground cafe.""  First of all, the salsa was AMAZING. Probably top 3 salsa's I've ever had (and I've been to Mexico.) The eggs benny was perfect and creamy, they didn't overdo the jalapeños so it was a great amount of kick, and the potatoes were seasoned well and cooked evenly (I would have liked a bit more potatoes on the plate.)  Overall a great spot if you're looking for a nice spot to have breakfast and don't want to get a boring eggs and bacon classic. Eggs Benny, Scrambled Eggs, and Grilled Cheese!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"We were exploring Austin and found this place nearby so we had to come check it out. There was a small wait but we were happy to wait when we saw some of the plates coming out of the kitchen.  We were seated and greeted right away and our server was super busy but was also very attentive the entire time. After ready the entire menu a million times I finally decided to get the Texas Eggs in a Basket.  When my plate arrived I was impressed it was tons of food and it looked delicious. The bacon was cooked perfectly and so were the eggs and potatoes. The egg, pesto and cheese over this incredible jalapeno cheddar bread was an amazing experience that I wish I could repeat all the time. The flavors all worked together and it was an amazing dish that I will highly recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"The ambiance of this place is cool. Walking in, it's hard to figure out where they serve food but a little look to your left there's a staircase to the dining area. It was a bit small from first glance but such an awesome place. I ordered the veggie scramble no cheese. The menu offers a disclaimer that good food takes time, which it did but not unreasonable compared to larger restaurants.  The food was delicious and the service was great. Recommended 100%.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Excellent breakfast!  We tried the Mijas and the French Toast.  Both are full of flavor.  And they have very good coffee as well.  Strongly recommend this place.  Pros: Great food and friendly service.  Cons: Parking.  You will most likely have to pay the parking meter, but it is not that expensive.  Just a few bucks.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"This place was awesome! Great waitstaff, really good food. It's a tiny place and the food is cooked to order more or less so be prepared to wait, well worth it! Veggie Bennie Sausage Bennie Blt on toasted cheese bread See all photos from Mj M. for Arturo's Underground Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I was excited to check this place out as it has good reviews and was near our hotel. However, I forgot that a Monday downtown is not a brunch day, and we were disappointed by our 11:30am options when we got there.  My partner and I had two mediocre tacos a piece. Having been to Torchy's a few days before, these were really lacking. I wish we had gotten there earlier to enjoy the breakfast fare or on the weekend when we could have had brunch. I think our experience would have been better.  The guy at the counter was friendly and smiling. I liked the space. There were lots of M-F business folks getting their lunch when we were on our way out, so that's always a good sign. I might try it again next time I'm in town.",0
Coffee Shop 4,2 check-ins Hands down some of the best brunch you can get in Austin. My gf found this place and boy Im glad she did. We sat outside on a beautiful day and had an awesome waiter. Who recommended some breakfast sandwich that I can't remember the name of now and it was perfect. He was a fantastic server and the food was AMAAAAAZZZZINGGGG!!! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu in the future. Food porn,1
Coffee Shop 4,"Went here for SundayFunday/Brunch.  First, the carafe of mimosas is large and inexpensive.  Great way to start the day.  Decided to skip the appetizers so I could save room for mimosas.   Had the Diablo which was quite phenomenal.  It was rich and tasty.  The hollandaise sauce was just the right amount of spicy.  It was quite filling.  Since it was SundayFunday, the calories do not count.  The coffee was tasty and refilled often.  The ambiance is funky and cool.  There is a Mr. T lunchbox on display.  Need I say more.  Service was good and prompt.  Shall return.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Great food, great prices, cool location and vibe, friendly staff, and the food is DANK!  I got the juevos rancheros and it was a solid plate of spicy deliciousness for $8  My brother got the works taco and an egg bacon cheese sandy and said they were fantastic.  5/5 would recommend and will be returning.  Food was rushed to us also I don't think we had been sitting down for 7 minutes before we had hot food in front of us.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Love the breakfast so delicious. Totally going back again. I wish they do french toast as small plate, Egg thing forgot the name. This is good too. Banana foster.. yum",1
Coffee Shop 4,"There aren't enough good, centrally located breakfast places in Austin. and this one deserves bonus points for menu creativity and it's Keep-Austin-Weird vibe. Personally, I'm more likely to go to the east side to satisfy my yearning for chorizo, egg and cheese tacos or migas at Mi Madre's, but I definitely see what the fuss is all about. You may well be one of the many for whom Arturo's is the welcoming cult eatery you've been yearning for. Go ahead and give it a try.",1
Coffee Shop 4,Amazing brunch! I had the Diablo and it was simply perfection. Great flavors and just the right amount of spice. First time here and will not be the last!!!  My only complaint was the prices were a little high. $14 for the Diablo is too much. Especially near the campus. The Diablo. Absolutely delicious. Highly recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 4,Delicious! Nice little set up outside. Get the Austin Benedict it was amazing! The home fries are very simple but delicious. Staff was friendly and $14 for a carafe of mimosa.,1
Coffee Shop 4,Outstanding service and food with a Texas flare! Users beware because yelp sensores users responses they did mine.,1
Coffee Shop 4,"Cool little spot to have brunch. Inside felt a little small for us so we sat outside on a shaded table. We drank mimosas while we waited for our food. The wait for our food was a normal amount of time, and it wasn't that bad since we had our drinks :) I orders the migas plate and it was very flavorful, hot and satisfying! 4 stars for the service and food!",1
Coffee Shop 4,A great find on Yelp when we visited Austin last weekend! Came minutes before opening & people were pouring in when the doors opened. Great food & great service from everyone. Loved the fun atmosphere!,1
Coffee Shop 4,"2 check-ins Best brunch I've ever had! Seriously. I'm not usually a big fan of breakfast food but this place is the bomb. I ordered the Eggs in a Basket and it was DELICIOUS! I wasn't even hungry and it was still good. The jalapeño cheese toast, sunny side up egg, and pesto...MMMMM. But for real, that bread is GOOD. Other yummy options my friends got were the El Diablo, Alamo, and Caribbean French Toast. All good choices but the Eggs in a Basket and El Diablo are my favs. Their vanilla latte was also really good!  This place is super cute too. It's like actually underground. We had a party of 8 and we weren't too sure if they could even seat us. It looks so small and cute from the outside but when you go in, there's some stairs that go down to two bigger seating areas. There's always a bunch of people there too so expect like a 25 minute wait for a table. The food also takes a while to come out so don't come here if you need to leave in an hour.  Tl;dr: A hidden gem! Eggs in a Basket and El Diablo are DELICIOUS (aka the jalapeño cheese toast). Be prepared to wait for a table and food. El Diablo. SO TASTY!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I'm not much of a yelper, but this place deserves a review. It's the week before UT gets back in session on a gloomy Sunday morning and we arrived about 30 minutes before 10 not knowing if there'd be a rush. Aside from another group of 4, we were the only people willing to wake up early to be there when the doors opened. We're fat kids at heart so we salivated over the menu and pictures from other reviews throughout the week. Needless to say, we were ready to order before walking inside.    By nature, I'm a Benedict fan but the Diablo was calling my name. My female companion ordered the Texas eggs in a basket. Let me say this. Phenomenal. The Texas eggs in a basket were my favorite by far. The buttery Texas toast coupled with the egg and smeared with pesto underneath. Absolutely spectacular. The Diablo was delicious as well and my stomach is aching from attempting to finish the lot.  This just became our official breakfast/brunch spot and we'll definitely be back for more.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Listed in 2016 Yelp 100! Challenge! Featuring Brandon and Kaitlyn at today's brunch:  ""The food made up for not feeling accommodated"" - Kaitlyn  ""5 star food, 3 star service"" - Brandon  Tip: Get the Diablo and the Mimosa  The food is great, but they are stingy with the potatoes.  Service is average, didn't accommodate a group of 6. Rather split us into two groups of 3. The place wasn't full either.  Place is cool looking, small and cozy. Menu 2 Menu 1 Western Melt on the left of the plate, Diablo on the right",1
Coffee Shop 4,"It's been a while since I came here so the details are blurry, but I do remember our group of 3 really enjoyed our Sunday brunch. Food and coffee were on point. Would definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I live closeby, so the location is perfect for me.  All of the breakfast tacos are pretty good, and I think their coffee is very solid as well.  The underground area is pretty nice for eating or hanging out.  Careful with the tacos though, they're very hot at first.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"MAN!! That Jalapeño Cheddar bread, tho!  If you see it, order it! Trust me, you will not regret it. This place is a little hole-in-the-wall, and trendy as it may be, the food is just devilishly good... I tried everyone's plate at my table, that is just how I roll and everything was cooked to perfection. This place is small, and gets packed, so just FYI.  The service was great and we were in good company with some of my local friends, so it was that much better. I didn't see or try anything that was mediocre, it was all legitimately delicious. TRY IT OUT! And don't forget that bread! YUM!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Absolutely loved this place! We got here just as they were opening on a Saturday morning. We were third in line so no wait! It's an interesting little place and the decor gives it character. I got the Texas eggs in a basket and it was SO good! I'm not even a fan of jalapeños but that jalapeño bread was amazing! My +1 tried the Diablo benedict at the recommendation of the waiter. He really liked it, but to me it wasn't impressive after already trying my dish. We both left really impressed with the place. I'll probably make this a mandatory stop for any time I'm visiting Austin again. The Texas eggs in a basket...best thing ever!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"We went to Austin for a concert back in November 2015.  SO the next day we were looking for a place to eat.  Checked Yelp and found this place.    Atmosphere was nice.  We waited for maybe 10 - 15 minutes.  Food was good!  If ever we are back in Austin, will probably return! :-)",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Had the pleasure of trying out this little gem for brunch this morning.  We arrived at 10:15 - about 15 minutes after they opened. There was already 15-20 minute wait. This place is small.. And popular! We ended up waiting more than 30 minutes, but didn't mind. They had self-serve coffee while you waited, and luckily the weather was nice (the only place to wait is outside).  I got to try both the salmon eggs benedict and the spicy Alamo eggs Benedict (sausage, cheddar cheese, and chipotle hollandaise). Both were excellent. Despite how busy they were, the hollandaise and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I get annoyed when restaurants over cook their poached eggs.  Saw other people around me order the migas and the French toast - both of those looked great as well! We'll definitely be back. The service/staff was also excellent. Everyone was super friendly. Plus.. They give you a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie when you leave. How awesome is that?!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Came here with a group of 8 for a lovely Sunday lunch, and didn't have to wait long at all to find a seat, even though the space is pretty small. Went down a few small staircases to get to our table - not sure if it's called underground because it's slightly below the ground or if it's ""underground"" and not everyone knows about it yet...  The menu looked fantastic and I had trouble decided between a few different dishes. I eventually went with the Texas melt and loved it. It came down to what kind of egg I wanted, and the poached egg here was delicious. A lot of the dishes come with hollandaise sauce which is not for everyone, but you can get it on the side (but I don't get you if you don't like hollandaise). I also had a bite of my friend's Caribbean French toast which was also really good, but one bite was enough as I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Some of us also had the grapefruit mimosas, but to me, mimosas are mimosas, it's all the same.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Very nice!  Took my parents for Sunday Breakfast, service was awesome and food very good.  Would not hesitate to go back again!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Friendly service, big portions, fresh, delicious food, great prices. Cool decor and vibe. What else could you ask for? Get the Migas asap.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Great food! Stopped in Austin and wanted to find a local place for brunch, this was a good choice! Friendly service from seating to checkout. Casual atmosphere and yummy brunch options. We tried a Benedict and a scramble, both were great.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Arturo's: is it a coffee shop with tacos, or a taco joint with coffee? It's hard to tell because both are pretty good. Don't be fooled by the small area inside around the counter, the downstairs with seats is pretty large and can fit large parties. The food menu is actually pretty huge, with lots of mexican style breakfast items, especially breakfast tacos. Said tacos were good, but not up to the Torchy's bar, though the migas were nearly as good. The everything tacos were a little soggy and could use more flavor, though luckily there was plenty of hot sauce to be found. The coffee here is also pretty good, especially the espresso drinks that are made fresh. The regular coffee itself was good though I'm not a huge fan of coffee sitting out in a pot all day long. An iced coffee was my favorite, and it was perfect for a warm day.",1
Coffee Shop 4,This place is amazing I ordered the Diablo and wow! That's was one of the tastiest breakfasts I have ever had and was rich with flavor... It was so good I had to take a nap afterwards haha... And the service was top notch. Every employee was very kind,1
Coffee Shop 4,Excellent food! Would have been 5 stars if the staff was more on point & the AC was working properly. Caribbean French toast is the sh#*!,1
Coffee Shop 4,First time vistors will be new regulars! Coffee was great but the Caribbean french toast won this Houstonian visitor over. I dont know what they do in that little kitchen but I could honestly slap my momma for that breakfast.,1
Coffee Shop 4,Went to Arturos for brunch and it was busy. The food was good and wall art was cool. The food did take a long time to come out. Between waiting for a table and actually getting my food it took an hour. I would go back but it would need to be a time when they are just a little less busy if there is such a time. The eggs Benedict were delicious. French toasr Texas egg basket Chorizo benedict,1
Coffee Shop 4,"Very Austin vibe to Arturo's - underground (literally!) with a range of work by local artists on the wall.  My wife had a Veggie Benedict (plus bacon, go figure) and I had a scramble with sausage, tomatoes, onions, chipotle sauce, tortillas and salsa (with fruit on the side as an extra).  Tortillas were quite fresh, and the egg mixture had just the right balance of all the ingredients, with a kick of spice from the chipotle.  The veggie benedict was considered the best of Austin by my wife, with a homemade muffin, and a hollandaise sauce that did not overwhelm with lemon.  The side of potatoes and bacon also more than passed muster.  Coffee and a latte were quite good (coffee is a little pricey at $3, but the latte was a good deal), and it took a bit of time for the main dishes to show.  Service was attentive and friendly.  A nice time - we hope to come back here.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I literally walked in at 10:50, they waited ten minutes to take my order then told me it was after 11 so I couldn't order breakfast. Sure maybe the food is good, but I probably won't be back.",0
Coffee Shop 4,"Come on, $1.85 breakfast tacos, funky decor and good coffee?! I love menus that cater to the college students budget. ;) Wall mural at Arturo's Underground Art work at Arturo's",1
Coffee Shop 4,"The ""Austin"" Benedict was DELISH. The bacon was a few strips cut in pieces, avocado, egg, chipotle hollandaise sauce (not overpowering) on an English muffin. The parking is in the lot across the street for a couple dollars $4=3 hrs or so, or wherever you find it in the street. The wait to be seated outside at the door was about 15 minutes. The time to receive our breakfast plates was roughly 45+ minutes. It was one of those things where you talk forever and then you all realize ""wait, where the hell is our food?"" But our server was really attentive with the mimosas, waters, and coffee. So overall a good breakfast & I will be back. Austin Benedict and cappuccino Austin Benedict",1
Coffee Shop 4,"I was shocked when my coworker took me here. As someone who works at UT and who also is an alumn, I thought I knew all the food spots around campus and yet I had never heard of Arturo's. It totally looks like a college spot with funky paintings decorating the space and fairly ratty tables and chairs.  None of this bothered me because the food and food prices were both good and this place is all in walking distance of campus!  I got a pesto mushroom sandwich and it was really tasty. Nicely toasted and the pesto was yummy. The menu is pretty large for such a tiny place and I can't wait to come and try their brunch sometime.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Amazing.  Great vibe, better food.  The sausage patties are spicy and wonderful.  $14 carafes of mimosas.  Coffee is top notch and a cookie dessert. Migas scramble",1
Coffee Shop 4,"The food was adequate, but the staff was a little brusque and curt.  Maybe I expected more because of all the great reviews, but I found the food to be just ok, nothing special.  The funky decor is cool, though.",0
Coffee Shop 4,"I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning right when they opened and was so glad I cam early because this place gets busy fast! By the time I left there was a long line of people waiting to be seated. Don't let this scare you away though, even if you have to wait it will be well worth it! We started with a carafe of mimosas which had more champagne than Orange juice which is about the only way to judge a mimosa. I ordered the ultimo which is served on jalapeno cheese bread.....I literally do not need to say anymore than that....just go there and order it. You won't be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Leaving happily miserable. The coffee.... My husband took a sip and said ""I haven't had coffee this good since we were in Italy"". We split the bangin Heathen Special of $10 mimosas and free cookies, the el diablo, and vegetariano benedict with bacon. Lots of bacon. Oh... And the Caribbean French Toast.... Rum sauce. Yumyum epic. I'm dying of complete-satiated-ness, if that's a thing. Arturo's, I will see you soon. From Rusty with love!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"So far, I've had the Migas and the Chicken Quesadillas. Both were excellent. The Migas came with these potatoes that were awesome. There are many varieties of Quesadillas, but I recommend the ones with corn and black beans in them.  Portion sizes are big enough to fulfill any appetite. It's a little bit pricey, but the ambiance is totally worth it. Cool staff, cool customers, Cool art on the walls...  Even cool books. I liked one of the books on their shelf so much, I actually ordered it off Amazon.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Had a great experience here. The atmosphere was really good, sweet paintings and the all the staff were friendly & helpful!  We had the french toast & the Caribbean French toast... Both were delicious; more food than we  both could eat. Not to mention their coffee was really good. Overall A+ Street view of Arturo's Caribbean French Toast... Amazing!!!",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Very delicious. I had a cappuccino and the Migas. My daughter had the French toast and they were sooo good. The food was so fresh! Service great, but come in early, before the time it closes. We got there at 1 and after us they close the kitchen, even when they were suppose to close at 3pm. Cappuccino ... Yum.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"The weather probably bumped this up .5 a star but 3.5 still isn't shabby. We had a bit of a wait and had to stand outside for about 10-15 minutes but it was beautiful out so we didn't mind it at all.  I'll start with the $14 mimosa carafes. it's the perfect champagne to orange juice ratio. Come with a couple of friends and you guys are all set to get your day drinking started with a bang.  As a group we tried the El Diablo, Caribbean French Toast, Bueno and Migas Scrambles --  all two thumbs up. I told our server Gabriella (who was great) that if I had more thumbs I would have given more.  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice brunch spot in town.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"Watch out if you blink you may miss it.  Nice small place to go on a weekend for brunch.  Being that the place is kind of like hole in the wall in size iwouldn't recommend it for big groups. Atmosphere was fairly cool. I couldn't really tell if the A/C was on or not, but being that it's underground it was comfortable.  We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes but a place like this is well worth the wait. They did have water outside while you wait and tent to stand in will in line. The menu was simple enough to understand.  NO SUBSTITUTES on the different items.   Food came very promptly and was delicious.  I had the Caribbean French toast ($11) highly recommended.  The right amount of syrup was in the plate to where it didn't make the toast soggy. My wife had the Austin Benedict which came with breakfast potatoes. It filled her up.  I would definitely come back.  You should try it out. Front Caribbean French toast with a side of scrambled eggs",1
Coffee Shop 4,Listed in Brunch so hard This cute little underground cafe has a spectacular brunch! They also have a heathen happy hour from 10-12pm when they discount their mimosas. Go get some brunch! :),1
Coffee Shop 4,"Everything was SO GOOD! And really reasonably priced! Patio seating is available. The queso was I had the huevos motulenos, it was a heaping plate of fantasticness! Great brunch option, we walked in and got chips & salsa, a mimosa and a screwdriver all within 5min.",1
Coffee Shop 4,Was looking for a breakfast spot close to the university. We were so lucky this popped up on Yelp. The food was delicious and the service was great. Kyle was our waiter and brought us chips and salsa while we waited for our breakfast to come out. He was so much fun. I had the Ultimo breakfast sandwich on their cheddar jalapeño bread. Loved it. There coffee was really good too. The Ultimo sandwich.,1
Coffee Shop 4,Loved the Thai chicken salad!!! We also ordered the chicken quesadillas- they were great as well! This place is tucked away in downtown Austin and has a very cool vibe. The food and restaurant are not pretentious but great flavors and cool energy. Service was great too and the food was brought out to us very quickly!,1
Coffee Shop 4,"This place is the bomb.  Everything on the menu looked awesome and out Austin Benedict and  Diablo open sandwich were great.  The clientele and servers ranged toward ""Austin hipster"" as did the political cartoons on the wall.  A highlight was the carafe of mimosa, which was one of the best tasting I've ever had.",1
Coffee Shop 4,"This place is so bad I fed my whole meal to the pigeons. I couldn't even drink the tepid toilet water I was snarkily offered that was sitting in a dispenser near the register. If you can't get water right what's left? Ok, my mimosa is ok. But the help here is a little too sassy for my taste. Leave the sass at home.  The building is cute.",0
Coffee Shop 4,"Excellent coffee, delicious salad, I loved the attention, nice with dogs! I recommend with no doubt! My only complaint is they close early.  They should stay open a little bit longer in the afternoon. Nice outside",1

Coffee Shop 4,Wow! First time at Arturo's and we will be back. I had the El Diablo and he had the Benedict Marcos. One of the best brunches we've had in Austin! Seating is tight so get there at 10 for their Arturo's Underground Sunday Brunch! El Diablo at Underground Brunch!,1
Coffee Shop 4,"This place has a really cool Austin feel that presents breakfast plates with eclectic touches. I loved the menus- they all have different covers that sparked a little conversation amongst the group- it's really the little things. The group of us ordered a carafe of mimosas, which I would recommend as a good deal ($16 for roughly a glass and a half for 4 of us vs $4 each for one glass each). Ah, now for the food. I ordered the Texas Eggs in a Basket...which definitely has its own nuances that make it special- jalapeño cheddar bread with pesto etc. I was a little disappointed that when I cut into it, my egg wasn't runny, making the dish as a whole a little dry. I asked for hollandaise sauce to cure this problem and it worked for me but I do with my over easy egg was actually over easy. Other than that, everything else about my dish was pretty perfect. My friends had the Austin Benedict, French toast and the el Diablo. I will probably be back, but will likely try something new. Cute and cool little details ! Pretty yummy! Great hangover cure Over easy egg, not over easy",1
Coffee Shop 4,The Texas Eggs in a Basket plate is one of the best things that's ever graced my palate. I can't wait to go back and try the Caribbean Toast.  The service was great. The atmosphere was great. I highly recommend this place! Texas Eggs in a Basket... aka heaven on a plate.,1

Coffee Shop 51,"3 check-ins BEST LATTES! :)  Their prices can be a little more than you pay for coffee but trust me, its so worth it!  ICED VANILLA LATTE! You have to try this! Almost every coffee I go to and order lattes they always taste like milk and the syrup. Patika's lattes taste super good! The coffee and milk proportions are perfect! even with the iced one, the it does not get watered down easily.  I'm so glad my best friend introduced me to this place. Its also a perfect place to study! It doesn't get too full here and when it does, it isn't too loud for you to lose focus.  I would love to try their other menus but this latte has stolen my heart.  The employees here are super sweet. They make your order super fast and their customer service is a 10/10. Iced Vanilla Latte $5.09",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Went here on a Sunday for brunch. It was super quiet in the morning. I ordered a latte for my drink which was delicious and served at the appropriate temperature. Pretty much only two ways to screw up the latte for me is to use too dark of a roast on the beans or serve the milk too hot. They didn't commit either of those sins.  To eat, I ordered the kale bowl. This was some of the best kale I've ever had. I'm not sure if it's the dressing or they gave it an extra long massage. All the flavors worked well together with the olives and the tomatoes creating a nice balance. The bowl did get kind of spicy at the end because the thin slices of serrano pepper built up an intense heat in my mouth so fair warning to you who might be spice intolerant.  Would definitely go back for my brunch items.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 I was visiting Austin and needed somewhere to camp out before speaking for one of the campus ministries at UT. One of the church members recommended Patika Wine and Coffee. Since she gave it such high reviews, I decided to drive out to Lamar. As someone else said, Patika is an 11/10 and a great choice. Turns out they were exactly right!  The ambience is so attractive with a mix of wooden table seating and bar seating alongside the wall. They maximize space well. They also have an outdoor patio area in which they also started serving breakfast and lunch.  I knew exactly what I wanted - afternoons I was feeling a cold brew. They actually had some in which it had been refrigerated for 24 hours. Wow, the flavors all permeated together in my mouth like a perfect coffee should. The coffee was quite strong but smooth to the taste- exactly how I like it! Cold brew!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"This lovely little coffee and tea shop is located in the shadow of a modern storage facility and at first, I had a little trouble finding it. But when I did, I appreciated the very kind staff and the quiet interior. I noticed several women working there late one evening on their laptops, which means to me they feel it is a safe and comfortable environment. Out back, there is a little shaded patio. I attended a small Meetup there, and enjoyed the space very much. Enjoyed a patio gathering at Patika one fall evening with the founder of Two Hives Honey.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"4 check-ins Probably the best coffee in South Austin. Delicious pastries too. Locally owned, they started as a coffee truck in the hart of downtown, even then they served really outstanding coffee.

(I find it so hard to concentrate in coffee shops that amp up the music so the workers can enjoy their time listening to their music agh) - Limited Parking space in the back  Coffee/ Other selection: o Regular coffee selections but I always get my normal Americano so it didn't even matter +Iced Americano was so tasty- super smooth and it had a really distinctive coffee scent + Americano was $2.98! (Penny cheaper than Mozart's & with better wi-fi!) + The Orange rosemary scone was pretty unique and tasted sweet & yummy + They have a small selection of pastries to choose from in case you need something to munch on!  Service: + Quick and friendly. I took two transactions to get coffee and my pastry bc I couldn't decide on which pastry I wanted and they were super kind abt it! Orange rosemary scone & iced americano,1
Coffee Shop 51,"Such a cool find! The atmosphere is really nice- quiet, which is refreshing compared to most places in Austin, with lots of people cozied in and working there for the day. I got an almond milk latte and a citrus muffin and sat at a very comfortable bar stool overlooking the busy street. The muffin was outstanding and moist even at 2:30pm on a Friday. The latte was also really good without a trace of bitterness. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I came here to study on a Saturday morning, and I must say I was very productive here! Productivity = good coffee shop for me.  What I really love about Patika is their aesthetic. The furniture, the layout, everything just makes you feel..wow I'm smart for studying and wow I'm artsy for coming to a place like this! :o  Would definitely revisit.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I could go to Patika every day and not get tired of it. Great lattes, and amazing baked goods that change every day. The atmosphere is relaxed and the decor is low-key and hip. I just tried their new full breakfast and lunch menu for the first time, and will definitely be needing to try more items. I had the Not A PB&J toast, which was the perfect sweet/savory combo and was way more intricately flavored than I was expecting from the description on the menu.  It does seem that it's getting more and more crowded here every weekend, especially after 10.  I hope they expand to include the newly-vacated bike shop's space next door!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Yep, I definitely miss Austin coffee shops. The natural light brought into this place is great. A lot of natural features and minimal so it's not distracting.  They make some mean coffee. Mainly because I remember getting a cup at their little trailer on 4th st years ago. Now look at them. There's ample seating for the size of the place and a community table for meetings or just stealing a seat to get some work done.  It's funny how many Macbooks sit all around you when you're there but that's life.  I'll be back when I'm in town!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I do not like coffee, but I love tea!  This place was cool for sure!  I was looking to kill sometime before I met up with a friend and stopped in here.  When you pull in you drive around to the back to park.  They have a nice outdoor patio area in the back.  It's a comfortable little coffee shop with places to chill and get connected.    I ordered the vanilla honeycomb tea and the popcorn trio.  The tea was tasty.  I would order it again.  I liked the vanilla flavor to it.  The popcorn trio was a little different but still good.  My favorite flavor, probably because of my sweet tooth was the caramel pretzel chocolate.  The chili lime and garam masala were ok.  The trio popcorn was a little much to eat alone in my opinion.  It would make a great snack for 2 people - so it is shareable - fyi.    Patika is a cool place to relax with a tea, coffee, wine or beer ... whatever your thing is you can do it and hang here. Vanilla honeycomb tea and popcorn trio - from the left - caramel pretzel chocolate, garam masala, chili lime Food behind the glass Menu See all photos from Amanda S. for Patika",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I love Patikas.  The coffee is delicious - I've only ever gotten an iced americano here. So I guess their espresso is delicious haha. Today I had their ""friendo"" espresso.  Their staff is some of the friendliest, coolest staff. Also their interior is beautiful, cozy, and bright with mostly natural lighting. It makes it perfect for studying, getting work done, or even catching up with a friend.  I have never had anything less than a phenomenal experience here.  (Only downside is parking though. Although they do offer more two stores down.)",1
Coffee Shop 51,I went there this morning after a year and things have spruced up! Brunch is a welcome addition. Patika brings a little Marfa vibe to south Lamar.,1
Coffee Shop 51,"7 check-ins Very trendy and modern coffee shop located on South Lamar. It has outdoor and indoor seating area, indoor tends to be packed most of the time. But I really prefer outdoor, has shade, breeze and it is quieter.  A little pricy drinks $4-6, it also offers very tasty pastries. I had the muffin and it tasted amazing. Popcorn trio was interesting and unique. Caramel chocolate, chili lime and another one. It's a big portion and good to share. I probably would not get it again because it really wasn't my type. But it's worth the try $8.  Everyone who needs to study/work needs to come and visit this place! Ps, no parking issues either! Also, live bands music on Wednesday and Thursday night, website is updated daily with their daily pastries and bands! Jazz night (Wednesday & thursday) Outdoor",1
Coffee Shop 51,Adorable! The coffee was great and I love the atmosphere. I got a salted bagel that was delicious. I live in VA but travel to Austin about once a year. Would love to come back one day:),1
Coffee Shop 51,"4 check-ins Listed in Cutest Cafes in Austin, Austin Espresso Essentials I can't really think of anything I dislike about Patika, and all my experiences here have been positive, so five-stars is pretty deserving. This place is pretty much everything you'd want a coffee shop - an open, comfortable space with a good amount of seating indoors and outside, friendly staff and quick turnaround on your order, and of course good quality coffee with pastries to complement it.  The space is open and inviting, with sort of a modern, minimalistic vibe. I absolutely love the details in the decor - there is unique artwork, a small piano and bench in one corner, flower pots, and super convenient cream/sugar and water bars right in the front of the shop.  As for the coffee - I think that Patika has some of the best latte art I have been given in awhile, and their coffee is smooth and a good balance of bitter and sweet. I would maybe even say it's one the best quality espresso locations in Austin.  In the area, this is the place to go for coffee! I'll be back again in the future. outdoors cute! iced vanilla latte & a hot latte beautiful art!",1
Coffee Shop 51,They just opened up a trailer in the back and just.....wow. I have been to a ton of breakfast spots around Austin and this place hands down has the best breakfast sandwich in Austin and possibly the WORLD!!!! You need this in your life.,1
Coffee Shop 51,"I liked it more before it became a free office for many.  Interior designer who wields a paintbrush, understands the viewing height of art, understands when to have rules and when to break them. Coffee and service are good, can be slow when packed which is often. Parking is tough.  I loved it right after it opened, when it was a coffee shop for friends gathering and chatting, and before it became a free office space for many lone people to sit at their computers working and talking on the phone.  For me, great cafe but wish it had not become transformed into that place where every table is a home office. The cost payoff for providing free WIFI and free office space for people who pay $2 for a cup of coffee has to be challenging for these adorable tiny cafes... especially when all of the parking spots are filled with nice cars of these nice lone coffee office workers.  Love the architecture and the art and the space, but whereas I used to go about once a week, I now go about once every 3 months.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I wasnt too impressed with this coffee shop as they use beans from (in my opinion) the worst coffee shop in San Francisco, Four Barrel. The beans smell as pretentious as the baristas, and frankly we dont need that in Austin.  Plenty of other roasters in town to use, it just shows that the city is changing and outsourcing their beans to SF and Portland because its so KEWL.  The barista was sweet. but she didnt seem like she wanted to be there at all. Kind of like it was my fault she had to work to make money.  Needless to say, ill hit Summermoon or DoJo instead.",0
Coffee Shop 51,"Listed in Long weekend in Austin Cafes that also serve wine are probably one of my favorite things. My husband and I stopped by early one evening when we had time to kill before some plans later on. The place is really cute and the staff was very friendly. There was lots of seating, including out back on the patio. They have an attached parking lot, which was great. We had a sweet vanilla latte as well as an iced chai and both were very well made. Great outdoor area",1
Coffee Shop 51,"2 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffee Patika pretty much fits the bill when it comes to what I look for in a coffee shop. The interior is clean, spacious, and plentiful in natural light (big windows and a skylight). There are plenty of tables inside, and it has an overall quiet and relaxed vibe, making it conducive to studying/reading. There's also a parking lot in the back, so there's no hassle with street parking!  On to the drinks: the vanilla latte is awesome, and I also really like their cappuccino. I'm not much of a coffee aficionado, but I think they both tasted great! The baristas are friendly and make the atmosphere cozy and inviting.  A con, if anything, is that it gets kind of dark if you're here when the sun starts to go down. The actual lights in this place aren't very bright, so if you're coming to study, I suggest coming during the day and soak up the natural light when you can, haha. Vanilla latte!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I ventured to this tiny, tiny coffee shop today for a meet up with my boss for my internship. Patika's significantly sparse square footage is compensated for by it's minimalistic, industrial interior design. The beautiful space is soaked in natural lighting encouraged by large windows and stark white walls that envelop the environment. Although occasionally a little try-hard - I paid particular attention the art that graced the walls, which were a nice touch. Each table essentially was being used a mini home office, which was very conducive to a productive environment - perfect for college student me.  I came in at around 9:30 am, which seemed like rush hour but the traffic significantly subsided after 10:30 am as space became more available and ample. I ordered the sweet vanilla latte and paired with a freshly prepared pastry - both had a quick turnaround. The latte was good with some of the best latte art I've seen in a while, but at it's steep price I wouldn't call it amazing.  Would visit on occasion due to how far it is from campus and it's steeply priced menu, but definitely want to try out the carefully curated, seasonally evolving wine list another time when I'm not presenting a pitch to my boss LOL sweet vanilla latte",1
Coffee Shop 51,"As many others have commented, the place is super tiny. If you're looking for a comfortable place to work I would advise looking elsewhere as not only are tables scare, but there isn't much space between people.  Due to the reduced parking more then likely you will have to park a few doors down which seems short sighted in planning.  The mocha latte I had was good, but wasn't able to justify the facilities limitations.",0
Coffee Shop 51,"Relaxing environment where you can easily get some work done or read a book. The best part about this place is the natural lighting! I hate cafes with dim lighting or unnatural LED lights. This place is awesome since they have huge windows that allow the sun to come in and brighten the place up. They have nice large tables where you can easily crack open your books or laptop and let the time pass by.  However, their wifi was terribly slow for me. I read that other people had the same problem so I hope that they fix it soon. I understand that the Internet may be slow when there's a large amount of people but come on, this is a coffee shop!  I ordered their latte and tried out a couple of pastries as well. I usually order Americanos since I don't really enjoy my coffee with milk or sugar, but I wanted to try something new since I heard their lattes were good. I wasn't disappointed! The latte was perfectly smooth and not too sweet at all. Definitely would order it again.  All in all, a solid coffee shop. Definitely would come again when I want a relaxing environment. Regular latte",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I came here on a weekend but for some reason it was fairly empty. My friend got some coffee and the foam art was super pretty and she really liked it! The aura of the whole place is very nice and soothing, perfect for studying especially bc patika only serves coffee and snacks and not heavy food",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Gorgeous interior, and fabulous teas! Perfect spot to get some work done in the evenings.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"My favorite Austin cafe!  I usually get the teas and they come out in cute lil teapots. Great tea selection too! They serve freshly baked goods and mix it up daily. The natural lighting, decor, & ambiance - I love it!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I've been a fan of Patika for the past three years, ever since they just had a coffee trailer downtown. One of the first things I did when I moved to Austin was search for the best coffee in town. After visiting nearly 20 different coffee shops, I found my soulmate in Patika. Not only is the coffee impressive, but all the baristas are highly skilled and consistent in their work. They also appreciate the loyalty of their longtime customers (which can't be said for some of the other places I've frequented in the past). The one drawback? At that time they didn't have a brick and mortar. How I kept dreaming of the day they would, so I would have a place to plant myself for several hours. Well, that day finally came in September 2014!  Since they first opened their doors, I've been a regular. I work remotely, so I affectionately call this place my ""office"". It's really become my second home. So where do I start?  Well, for starters the whole vibe in this place is just awesome. The decor is clean, simple, and modern. There is lots of natural light and a variety of options when it comes to seating - whether it's at the community table, an individual table, or a taller table with stools. You can enter from either the front door or a set of double doors in the back that lead out to a beautiful patio area with a great, big pecan tree.  As a mom of two kids, I'm also really picky when it comes to the cleanliness of a business. Not only is the place spotless, but even the bathrooms are nice. And let's face it, most coffee shop bathrooms are nasty.  Ambience-wise, I love their selection of music. They always put on a good variety - jazz, hip hop, chill electronic, French cafe music, reggae, bossa nova, etc. And as of May 2015, I noticed they have speakers outside now. Even better, is the fact that they have LIVE jazz every Wednesday! Which seems to be VERY hard to find anywhere else in Austin (unless you go somewhere more formal and official for jazz like the Elephant Room). As a jazz lover, I enjoy bringing my kids every Wednesday to just unwind. Reminds me of some fond memories I have of New Orleans. They also do an eclectic mix of live music on Thursdays.  Next is the coffee and food itself. I've had almost everything on their menu. All I can say is I haven't had anything I've disliked. My favorite is their cafe au lait and their cortado (more milk than a macchiato; less milk than a cappuccino). I also love their tea selection - especially this one tangy blood orange tea! Even the cups and mugs are stylish.  In the evening, they have a great selection of wine and beer (including the Japanese Hitachino Nest beer). As for their food items, let's start with their daytime menu of bakery goods and bagels. The bagels they get fresh from Rockstar Bagels and all their bakery goods are made in-house by Bria (not sure if I spelled that right?), their talented baker. She comes up with some ridiculously creative things that I haven't seen anywhere else. A few things that stand out are the glazed donut garnished with bits of chicken 'n waffles, spiced donut holes, the rosé muffin, the peanut butter sriracha cookie, and the chocolate chip corn flake cookie.  Then in the evenings they switch to a different menu of small bites that are fun to share with friends. I love the cheese plate (which comes with toasted baguette from Easy Tiger). The spiced nuts and affogato are also good.  Last, is the service, which is outstanding. Owners Andy Wigginton and Nick Krupa really do run this business to perfection. I admit, at times I can be like a nagging mom (one of those ""annoying"" customers who is always making suggestions) but they really do listen to customer feedback. Several examples.... I (as well as perhaps others) suggested they put more signs in the parking area to direct customers to the alternate parking lot behind Mockingbird. Done. One day I complained about the internet being slow. Done.  As for the baristas, they are all equally wonderful - friendly, professional, accommodating, and consistent. I've seen the same baristas for years, since going to their trailer. And anytime you see the same employees year after year, you know the business is run well and the employees are happy to be there.  One last thing I wanted to say about this business is how welcoming it is to a wide variety of people. For those with baby strollers or disabilities there's a wheelchair friendly entrance in the back; for those on a bike, a spacious bike rack in the front. I often come with my two children; sometimes we'll even bring other kids for hot chocolate playdates or Italian sodas in the warmer months. So, yes, I can vouch it's a family friendly place. I've observed so many different kinds of people - those on job interviews, couples on their first date, SXSW out of town tourists, students studying, friends catching up, and then all the telecommuters, like me, working away on their laptops.  Truly my favorite place in Austin! That's right folks.... food porn at its best. Behold the cherry goat cheese thyme DONUT.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I double-dog dare you to find a coffee shop in Austin that's better than Patika. The baristas here serve up some great espresso, and the space is great for work or conversation. In other words, it's not too loud. Nice!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Here I am, and I must say that I am having a great time! Today is a Sunday, and it's the day before Memorial Day.  I am here with my two children and fiancee, and we are a coffee + tea family.  We scrutinize coffee like an interrogator questions criminals.  Here you go  Pros: Menu (very simple)         Quality (what we had was delicious)  Cons: Parking (found a spot, but I could see how this.  would be annoying          Selection (simple menu does not bode well for the promiscuous tongue)  I had two coffees, but the most impressive was the Iced  Coffee.  I told him to go heavy on the vanilla, which he did, and it was perfect.  I can feel the caffeine right now as I'm writing.  The prices were very reasonable.  I only do not give it a 5-star because I appreciate a bigger selection of flavors.  Ironically, the very thing which I applaud is the the thing which keeps me from giving a standing ovation.    Nonetheless, I recommend to anyone who wants to try coffee in this city and not be overwhelmed with selections.  This is the epitome of Quality vs. Quantity.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"The mocha latte I ordered was the best, I mean best, ever. Perfect temp, so delicious, and not too sweet! The environment and staff are so inviting, looking forward to going back! The best mocha latte of my life so far! Hot, so tasty, and not too sweet.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Great coffee shop with a modern, cozy atmosphere.  I came here a few times while in town. Iced coffee is delicious and refreshing. This place is pretty mellow so never had to wait in line for a long time and coffee came promptly. Service was friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"It's hard to stand out as a coffee shop, especially in a coffee shop filled city like Austin but Patika manages to do it.  The coffeeshop is welcoming and the baristas are passionate. They made my latte perfectly sweet and they do amazing latte art. There's a few seats inside and outside, and their patio is dog friendly.  When I went there was a good handful of people, but it wasn't packed with college students like you'd find at Epoch and Bennu. If you're in the area looking for a pick-me-up be sure to stop by.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"2 check-ins Listed in But first, coffee. Patika just makes my heart happy.  So if you've been in Austin for awhile, you know there aren't that many coffee shops with that modern, contemporary feel, so when I heard about Patika, I knew I had to visit.  Parking: There aren't many parking in the lot itself, but there are plenty behind Mockingbird Domestic (one building over)!  Coffee & Baked Goods: I've tried their latte, capcuccino, and iced vanilla latte. My favorite was the iced vanilla latte. Sweet, but not too sweet. They also offer a decent amount of baked goods. I tried the banana chocolate chip muffin, which wasn't as fresh as I had hoped for it to be, so eh.  Okay, let me just skip to my FAVORITE part about this place: the back patio. It's perfect. There are a good amount of tables and the lights strung across & above just set the mood ya know? It gives like this tucked-away, hidden garden kind of feel.  I did take off one star for the slightly-overpriced coffees and the slow Wi-fi, though. :(  But will be back often, Patika! Pretty cappuccino art Cappuccino & Latte",1
Coffee Shop 51,"9 check-ins One of my top favorite coffee shops in Austin (#1...#2?...gah can't decide). From their stand to their brick and Mortar, Patika has continually been a go to place for me.  Iced Vanilla Latte and Iced Mocha are my top choices. Their cookies continue to be amazing. Check their website in the ""Baked Goods"" section to see what cookies they're serving. I always look out when they serve the Corn Cookie. Recently I had the Peanut Butter Sriracha Cookie...soft, moist, and one of a kind.  The staff is super humble and are easy to have a conversation with. The atmosphere is great for reading and light conversations. They have an outdoor patio for more chit chat as well.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I have been coming here since it opened. I have been a huge fan. It's small but I have always had somewhere to sit. All of the baristas have been friendly and they have great coffee and tea selection. After hours? Well awesome wine and beer. I am not much of a wine drinker but the beer, they've ad some craft selections that I haven't had before. Pretty good!  My choice is coffee and their almond latte (my go to) is on point. They also have an outside patio area so if you need sunlight, do it. They are pretty cool with dogs (outside) so that's nice.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"17 check-ins I've heard amazing things about the coffee at Patika and when I came by, I was definitely pleased. I've come here a few times and I've had a cappuccino, regular latte, and a vanilla latte. All three of which were really good. Amazing? I wouldn't go that far. Although I've had better at other coffee shops in Austin, I would still highly recommend this place.  Parking used to be pretty limited here, but Patika now has more parking spots available. Yay!  The coffee shop itself is really clean and well-kept. There's also plenty of seating available. The ambience was pretty conducive to studying. I always try to sit in the back since it seems to be more quiet while the front is usually occupied by people socializing with one another.  Overall, I've had great experiences coming here and I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area. Vanilla latte. Iced vanilla latte. Cappuccino. See all photos from Matthew K. for Patika",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I dearly wish this place was closer to where I lived! The atmosphere is so cool, the barista was so nice and the coffee is so good. I got a pour-over of the Onyx coffee and it was impossibly smooth- it needed absolutely nothing added. My friend got a vanilla latte and said it tasted more ""real"" than any vanilla latte she'd had before. Good wifi, decent parking and enough of a variety to keep me coming back- which I will!!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Austin has a plethora of coffee shops to choose from, so how can you know which one are the best? For me, the most important things are the ambiance, seating, coffee taste, and customer service, and Patika fulfills all of these needs!  The coffee shop itself is light and bright inside, making it a good study spot.  Some Austin coffee shops can be a bit dim, making studying harder than it already is.  As for seating, I've always been able to find a spot.  There are multiple small tables, one big community table, a bar, and a couch to sit at. They also offer outdoor seating! The coffee itself is so smooth delicious (my personal favorite is the vanilla latte.)  The baristas are always super friendly, and one of them even brought my drink to me after I had to wait a while for it.  Overall, Patika has become my favorite coffee shop in Austin and I highly recommend it to any coffee lovers out there! Smooth and creamy, yet not too sweet, vanilla latte! Feat. barista's handy latte art",1
Coffee Shop 51,"What do I love?  Coffee is delicious and they take particular time making drinks.  The baked goods (scones especially) are DELICIOUS!  Unique flavors, and always fresh.  I think they make everything in house.  Prices are pretty reasonable, but you are paying for quality.  They have a good amount of seating with a ton of natural light and even tables outside.  What needs some work?  The avocado toast.  The bread wasn't actually toasted and there was way too much feta cheese on it.  I would also say that I've been in a few times and experienced the coffee shop snobbery that I think people fear.  Most of the time they're friendly but I think they could kick up the service a notch.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"9 check-ins This is my favorite coffee shop in Austin! Every drink I've tried here is great but my favorite is the mocha latte. The wifi is pretty good and they have an outdoor patio for when the weather is nice. But my absolute favorite thing about is the natural light!  While some coffee shops can feel dark and dingy, Patika's interior is bright, clean, well designed and has many windows so that the light can flood in. The music they play is not at all distracting so this has become my favorite spot to crank out some essays and do some reading, especially on a weekday when it's a little less busy.  However, I was here one evening and I found out that it's not very well lit apart from the natural lighting.

Coffee Shop 51,"2 check-ins Patika is excellent - staff is very friendly, and service is great. Pour over coffee is smooth and artisanal and they do potted tea which I love.  Get the olive and nut cluster plate for $5 - quite a good deal.  Only downside is that although they've had historically very fast wifi, it's become slower and jankier in the last month or so. A shot from one of the tables",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I got hooked on espresso a couple of years ago and now I can't stand any sort of drip coffee, so I definitely appreciate a good espresso when I can get it. Patika didn't fail me in that department. And wait.. They have beer too! And wine? Coffee and beer and wine? Yep. While I was there, they were playing a bunch of pop music from 2006-2011 (give or take a few years). Not really what you'd expect from a coffee shop, but hey, I appreciated it. I'd like to go back and try some pastries. They didn't have many while I was there.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"4 check-ins I was pleasantly surprised by Patika. After seeing their branding and the buzz around it and in accordance with my desire to visit all coffee places in town (evil laughter), I was delighted to come here for a little creative date a recent past Saturday.  Upon parking in one of 4 or 5 total spots in back and sitting at an outdoor table, I was delighted to walk inside and admire that the interior was a lot larger than I expected (originally anticipating being in a very clean Honda Element or something).  Upon seeing Sightglass Coffees on their shelves, I recovered from becoming the emoji with heart eyes before ordering a house coffee (delicious) and a goat cheese biscuit (delicious). And you know what, the house coffee was a mere $2. After I mentally passed out from the adorable succulents and fun toys at the cashier, I poured myself glasses of water and chatted with the studious neighbors.  We Austinites, so spoiled with the fantastic neighborhood coffee shop. Well this is no exception, and I'll take spoiled all day errday. I give them 100 (underlined) and would love to come back!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Very good coffee shop, but not good for remote work. I was so excited to see that they opened up a brick & mortar shop - I used to frequent their trailer downtown. Average prices for espresso or drip coffee. Very well decorated on the inside and I love the music they play in the morning.  My only complaint is the wifi. It is unbelievably slow. I work from home, which means I work at coffee shops. It's imperative that the internet works well. When Patika is crowded (it usually is), forget about doing research/browsing the internet. Any web pages will load slowly, if at all.  I had to leave early a few times because I couldn't get any work done :( They should definitely upgrade their internet plan for the volume of people working at the shop.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"2 check-ins Patika looks like a dinky fast food place on the outside, but it's gorgeous on the inside. The decor is very bright and modern, and it's so pleasant just being inside. I also saw a pretty large backyard from where I sat, but unfortunately I didn't venture outside.  The coffee here is great. Baristas are fast and friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 51,Went here for a glass of wine. Really nice atmosphere. And we were lucky that there was very good live music when we visited. Live music. Very good.,1
Coffee Shop 51,"Great new addition to the neighborhood!  This coffee spot has Cali-cool roots, without the pretension.  Modern interior with a simple blackboard of ordering options, keeping things no-fuss.  I noticed it was almost completely full with seating inside but really quiet, which is great if you come to work and not gab.  I'm sure this changes throughout the day as it shifts into beer/wine time, which they seem to have a great selection of also.  There's also a nice little patio out back with plenty of seating.    I ordered a sweet latte (vanilla) and mixed berry coffee cake and both were delicious and beautiful in presentation.  The food options were really interesting and not your average coffee shop fare.  The pricing seems about right and the quality is definitely there.  Only bummer was parking-only a few spots in the attached lot, so I needed to find parking on the side street (Kinney).  So many people walk/bike/bus in this area though, that I'm sure it won't be a problem for most.  Bonus points for the killer music selection (again, not your average coffee shop) that was low-key but still entertaining...think Al Green and a fun R&B version of Seven Nation Army.  I also noticed a few people putting things on their ""tab"", which is a great idea I hadn't seen before in this type of setting. Happiness. Mixed Berry Coffee Cake...the real deal!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Such sweet people working here. Really helped me decide on what to order based on my needs! Coffee shop was a little hard to find off the street but I sound it! Very trendy, quiet and calm. Good place to do work and study!!! Great non dairy iced coffeee",1
Coffee Shop 51,Drinks are overpriced. Internet is slow. Tables are sticky.,0
Coffee Shop 51,"Coffee Thursday! Everyone told me that I had to try this place so here I am!  :( Womp womp.... a bit of a let down.. So we get there and parking is very limited. Not a bad thing I guess considering this place is tiny! They do have an outdoor patio area but it's so..unattractive. Idk, maybe it's the construction next door and the awkwardness of the businesses next door and what not but it did not make me want to sit there at all.  The inside is very modern, clean, simple. I like it. I'd like it more if it didn't feel like a nicer version of the studio apartment I lived in in college. It's just very small and quiet.. They have great little spots to sit and chat/study. Some high tops and other booth/chair hybrid tables with cute pillows lining the walls for comfort.  The mochas were ok. Nothing to write home about. Nothing I'd crave. They were just, A-OK. The biggest problem I have with this place? The snooty attitude of the baristas. I asked one question and got an eye roll, a finger point, and then a back turned...not a single word.. Great! This attitude carried through from ordering, to the server bringing the cheese plate, to the guys moving tables around the store.  :( I really wanted to like this place.",0
Coffee Shop 51,"Disclaimer: I am not a cool hipster.  Came here to study with a friend, who had seen good reviews about it. Got here around 5 on a weekday to a relatively quiet, easygoing place. Massive points because I was able to park in the front, but do not fear if you get here and you don't see any parking! They do have some extra spots on the side and in the back :) Just make sure you don't park next door at the bike shop--they specifically ask you not to (via a paper sign on the door).  Got their chai latte, which was really pretty and delicious! Has a much more spicy taste than I'm used to, but I think I'm a fan. Also tried their vanilla latte, which is a little bit more bitter than I would like, but definitely pretty and yummy! Also, the baristas are pretty friendly, which I really appreciate. And their menu sign is fancy shmancy hipster (aka on chalkboards). Unfortunately, was down to study, so no wine, but seems like they have a fairly nice selection of elegant wines. Will come back on a more relaxed day to try those.  They have a nice piano near the back--not sure if it's just decoration or if people are actually allowed to play it.  Super easy to be productive here because there's just coffee shop music and rustling sounds of people (if you wanna block it out, bring headphones). They have big and small tables, so you can study with up to 4 people per table, or just 2, or even by yourself. For metal chairs, I think they're pretty comfy, but they also have wooden benches that have cute pillows on them.  Usually when I come to study at coffee shops, they're always filled with students trying to study/hang out, so it's either loud, packed, or worst case scenario, BOTH (especially places closer to UT campus). But VERY excited to find this place because it's so chill and quiet; easy to get work done (but this was on a Tuesday, so come on a weekend at own risk)!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"A nice little place with big windows, lots of table space and reliable wifi! My study buddy and I were able to get some work done over delicious coffees and fresh baked goods. There are several cute little nooks and crannies to relax in, and big tables to spread out and get work done. Is it slightly expensive? Yes. Are you surrounded by hipsters? Yes. But we are in South Austin folks, it's to be expected. Relax, people watch, count the jorts and snapchat the trucker hats. It's a nice little place to stop and enjoy, especially since it hasn't been overrun by students like some of my other favorite places.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"The five stars is for the iced latte, which is basically the best I've had. Worth going back for over and over. I had to add a bit of half and half and splenda, but I do to all my coffee drinks. With a bit of half of half it was heavenly. I also had the hot chai latte, but do not recommend it. The chai latte is not as good as Panera's or Bottega Louie's in LA. The cafe has decent wifi (a bit slow) and is REALLY clean. They also put long pillows on the wooden benches, which was a fantastic touch.  There wasn't enough parking right next to the cafe, but you can find additional parking one shop over on the unpaved back lot.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Definitely one of my favorite go-to coffee shops. The people are always so friendly and they keep the music to a minimum, if they play anything at all. There's lots of natural lighting and outdoor seating in the back. Interior design is super cute and clean. Coffee is on point.",1
Coffee Shop 51,Love this place! Great iced lattes! Always have different pastries and they are always delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. Iced latte and hot latte. Best in town!,1
Coffee Shop 51,"Sometimes when I go here, the people working make me feel like I'm ruining their conversation by wanting to order a drink. At they make me pay by not making my drink until they finish their conversation. I just waited15 minutes for a breve because the girl with gray hair simply couldn't talk and work at the same time, and she couldn't do either without touching her hair way too much. I really don't want to pay $6 for a breve and have your hair in it.  The drink I got was perfect and tasted great but there was nothing personal about my experience here.",0
Coffee Shop 51,"Yes. YES!  I wish this place had a counterpart up north, because I can't exactly get coffee here every morning - but I would if I could!  Things about Patika:  1. Love how smooth the coffee is - no burnt or bitter after taste 2. The people behind the counter are fun, joke around, and seem genuinely happy to be there 3. The decor is awesome - love the bronze colored, geometric chairs 4. Took one of my best friends - a genuine, but lovable, coffee snob - with me, and she LOVED it. Stamp of legitimate approval, ya'll!  And to think, i was only drinking a cup of coffee every few months - and I just HAD to visit Patika and fuel a new addiction.  But seriously, worth it. More, please!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"2 check-ins Listed in a latte love I liked Patika.  The coffee was good--not the best I've ever had (although this is strictly based on a vanilla latte), but it was good. Solid, even. It wasn't super far from campus, but it was past the river, and a little out of reach, so I wouldn't say I'd be back often.  Patika is a very cute, quaint, and modern coffee shop, and everything is decorated with light wood and white walls. There seemed to be an outlet near every table, which was really convenient. Lighting is perfect for studying/working, and the atmosphere was very warm. Most people in the back of the shop were working, and most people in the front of the shop were chatting, so it was kind of a half and half environment (a good thing, not a bad thing). There's also this cute patio out back for those days with perfect weather!  Parking wasn't THAT bad. Granted, I came on a Sunday, and I missed the building by a second, so I parked in the neighborhood without even looking at their tiny parking lot (and by parking lot, I mean four or five spaces in front of the building). The neighborhood wasn't far at all, and there were plenty of spaces, so parking is definitely do-able. Don't be scared to come if you're scared about parking (I almost didn't come because I was scared about parking, lol).  Service was friendly--I didn't really talk to the barista, tbh. But he brought my coffee over to my table, which always surprises me because coffee shops usually just call it out at the bar. I thought that was really nice.  I ordered a vanilla latte because I had gone to another coffee house (Figure 8) yesterday, and was craving that same taste (but I had wanted to try a new place). I don't know why I did that--I pretty much got my hopes up for nothing because no coffee shop's taste is ever exactly alike.  Their vanilla latte was good. Definitely better than Starbucks or your late-night Bennu's and many other coffee shops, but it was heavier on the steamed milk than it was on the espresso--I wish it was justttt a littleee richer. The sweetness was nice and very subtle though, great for those who don't like over-sweetened coffee.  Great place for coffee and working! Will be back~",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Updated review Updated review because though the pastries are amazing and coffee is good, the service can be quite slow.  I actually go there way less now because it's so cold in there.  On weeknds it's nice to grab a book and order a bunch of coffee for an hour but I go to other coffee shops b/c they keep it so cold in there.  If you are serving beer and wine and want people to stay or go more often, it would be nice to not keep it freezing.  It's been like that every time, so I only go there once every few weeks not instead of every weekend.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I was looking for a coffee shop in the area after taking a class at Sukha. Not the area I would normally hang out so I turned to Yelp for help. Found Patika so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find a parking spot right in front of the shop. But there are plenty of street parking in the nearby neighborhood if you can't find a spot in their small parking lot. I wanted to try their latte and pastry (I know I shouldn't have but it was so tempting). Their pastry was made in house and the presentation was great. I had the hardest time deciding between pineapple morning cake and lemon raspberry white chocolate muffin. So I turned to the guy at the counter for his recommendation. He recommended the pineapple cake. I'm glad I listened to him because the pineapple cake was delicious! I got my latte a few mins after, and it was definitely one of the best latte art I've seen in Austin. It's a bummer that it's really far from my house and work. But I'll definitely stop by whenever I get a chance to be in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 51,2 check-ins Patika Coffee. It's on point! I am a caffeine addict and I have a need for their coffee. I had the iced vanilla latte and a sweet mocha. Both were perfectly blended and the drink was surely a pick me up. The coffee shop has a nice contemporary design and also offers an outside patio for dog lovers. Iced vanilla latte The front of the coffee shop,1
Coffee Shop 51,"Went here a few times during our stay in Austin and really enjoyed it! Good espresso drinks, nice outdoor patio, (though construction going on behind it). Loved the interior/exterior design of the place too. Parking is a bit of an awkward situation, but it's definitely worth a trip! Nice macchiato!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Patika is one of the better options in town for quality espresso and filter coffee.  Lately they have been carrying Ceremony Coffee Roasters from maryland which is a nice break.  Traditionally their trailer was the best place in town to try Cuvee but they are mixing up roasters more at this shop.  Prices aren't over-priced, this is standard speciality coffee pricing.  The new in house pastry selection here is awesome.  Especially the rotating gourmet-whatever donuts with creative flavors.  The parking lot sucks balls but at least there is tons of parking next door that you are allowed to use.  Inside is always completely crowded with people sucking up wifi but they have tons of seating out back so I guess it's OK except when its 100+.  I'll also agree with another review that the clientele is mostly douchbags from California so you are gonna deal with that too.",1
Coffee Shop 51,Love this business. They're right across the street from my work and I'm super happy about that. They make awesome lattes. Not too sweet and the perfect temperature. The staff is always on point and so nice.  They have the best pastry chef ever... Her scones are the best. And the cinnamon rolls they serve on Sunday? To die for.,1
Coffee Shop 51,"Well lit, clean and amazing espresso. The team is friendly and the coffee is always on point. Great for a cup on the run, or a long stay in!  Ask for a cortado! They're well made and hold up well to even the biggest coffee aficionado in your group. Homemade Smores!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"5 for the flavor!  Do yourself a favor and get the iced vanilla latte and banana cardamom caramel muffin. Yes, it might feel a bit pricey, but I'd rather spend $4.5 on a coffee here than a Starbucks. The folks there are also pretty darn friendly too so that's a plus!  If you're from San Diego, their latte beats Better Buzz's Best Drink Ever ANY day!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"This is one of the top coffee bars in town with incredible ambiance.  Great coffee and the best pastries in town.    Here is my short list of things that make Patika stand out:  Pros:  - Great coffee and coffee drinks - Friendly staff - one of the best - Pastries which are unmatched in Austin - An inviting back patio with plenty of room, seating and shade - A cool vibe - They have wine, need to drop by after work!  Cons: - Easy to miss in the Lamar clutter  Treat yourself to a scone and coffee here.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Good coffee and friendly baristas. They pour a great cappuccino and don't skimp on the cream cheese with your bagel.  I'm not giving it 5 stars due to the lack of parking and some of their clientele. I probably shouldn't judge, but it's really annoying to hear 2 middle-aged narcissistic Californian women chat. I've been here numerous times and about half the time you get some really annoying self involved people talking about their unimportant over dramatized bs. Headphones, engage.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I had an extremely delicious mocha here yesterday, and it sealed Patika's place as a worthy coffee stop on the south Austin rotation. Last week, I attended an event here and had some of the best pastries of my life. We went back on Sunday especially for the French Onion biscuit, but unfortunately it wasn't there. The goat cheese and sundried tomato biscuits they did have looked tasty, but we really had our hearts set on the french onion.... So my only recommendation to patika is to post a bakery schedule or even tweet or fb the daily goods for those who have a favorite!  Otherwise, definitely worth a stop - smooth, delicious coffee drinks, great snacks, and a really nice modern but still warm decor. You can pick up coffee accessories here, too, like chemex and filters.",1
Coffee Shop 51,Hands-down the very best latte you can find in Austin. The interior is very nice and roomy and not crowded on weekdays (I haven't gone on the weekend so I don't know about the weekends.) The outdoor seating in the back is really nice too. There are plenty of tables to sit at and it is surrounded by trees so there are shaded areas if the sun gets to be too much. I highly recommend this place. Don't leave Austin without coming here at least once!,1
Coffee Shop 51,Friendly service and quaint little shop. The back porch was very cute and work friendly. Dirty chai was good but not the best,1
Coffee Shop 51,"I'm a total Patika fanboy. There is absolute magic in their drinks.  I am serious when I say this is the very best coffee I have ever had. It's no joke. No bitterness or burned taste whatsoever. I could drink their liquid happiness all day long.  The staff is friendly, the drinks are delicious, the atmosphere is quaint and quiet, and the bathrooms are surprisingly well-done. Did I mention how good the drinks are? They're fantastic.  This is THE place to get coffee in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 51,Good coffee but the modern furniture is very uncomfortable. It seems they don't want you to stay and relax,0
Coffee Shop 51,"This is the best coffee shop in Austin. Their espresso is so smooth and it doesn't leave you with the shakes afterwards. The only thing I'd improve is the internet. Sometimes it gets pretty crowded so the internet becomes basically impossible to use. I think I'd come here more if I knew the internet was reliable. The coffee is so great though, it's worth just popping in and out.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Went on a Sunday at 10:30 and there was parking right in front. There were a handful of people inside, and a handful outside on the patio enjoying the balmy winter day. Had the straight black coffee and loved it. Really liked the knowledgeable staff, music, skylights, ambiance, etc. Will definitely be back. Someone came in before me and cleared out all the food, so watch out for the pastry monster Sunday mornings... Exploring Conversations and patio in back. Coffee bar See all photos from Emily H. for Patika",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Good coffee with a lot of emphasis on style and taste, except for the fact that they serve it LUKE warm.   I don't expect burnt Starbucks coffee when I pay $6 for my latte but I do expect it to be warmish hot.   Apparently if you want it hot, you need to ask for it ""extra hot"" I was told.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"4 check-ins Although located in a busy section of south Lamar, the parking isn't terrible. It's pretty funny the bike shop next door has a sign that says free parking at the coffee shop with the purchase of a bike.  Coffee selection is good and thy also have tea choices for those that don't drink coffee. Seating is also decent with wide windows to look out into the Lamar traffic (if you're into that stuff).  The employees are also very hospitable.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"It's a bit out of my way, but what isn't when you live in north Austin?  Your basic coffee drinks, and a handful of pastries, I was expecting more food based on things I'd read. But maybe more food is coming. And I don't see any info about wines in here, but maybe that's because I'm here at 10am. No worries.  This place is painfully representative of all the other locally-owned coffee places in Seattle... I mean Austin. Small, and concentrating on a select few items, this place is a dime a dozen.  But don't get the impression that I dislike this place. I definitely don't. Local businesses are tops in my book, as a typical Austinite. The kids who work here are very nice, and I enjoyed my beautifully-decorated cappuccino. It's just that I didn't see much of a reason to go out of my way to come here again like I did this morning.  However, today is their official grand opening, so we'll see what the next couple of months bring.  If you need me in the meantime, I'll be at Fair Bean Coffee. Or Dolce Neve. Or La Patisserie. Or Once Over. Or Bouldin Creek. Or Seventh Flag. Or Epoch. Or... See all photos from Catherine T. for Patika",1
Coffee Shop 51,"really great iced soy lattes, even my young niece ordered one after trying mine, and she usually loves overtly sweet coffee concoctions. great modern space and vibe too, I could definitely study/hang out here for a while as the shop is spacious. I definitely will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Battled the misting cold weather to drop in for a cup of coffee on Saturday.  Parking is not great. We were able to snatch a spot as someone left, but there's probably only room for about 8 cars.  Baristas were friendly. Baked goods were decimated, which was disappointing since so many other reviews rave about how delicious they are. I ordered a latte and my SO got an Americano. I enjoyed mine, but I felt like the milk foam to steamed milk ratio was more in favor of a cappuccino.  Overall, I thought it was a solid coffee shop, but I don't really see a reason to stop here versus Seventh Flag on S. 1st, which has better parking and more space.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"From the outside, I thought this place was going to be small but it is super spacious. It is a very chill place that is great for studying - they have a patio out back as well. The coffee is great and they also sell a variety of baked goods.  The only problem I forsee is parking. Tea and cake",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Oh my what a cute place to come to and get caffeinated and get some work done and/or some socializing and catching up with your friends.  First time I came here I was greeted with a gorgeous smile from one of the gorgeous baristas behind the counter. Eye contact, smiling, and a nod to sit anywhere me and my friend would like was the best greetings. We weren't entirely too sure if we should sit and wait for wait service or go up to the counter. The baristas friendly greeting gave us the cue to sit down and get comfortable. Waters were brought out as the barista greeted us & was provided a wine/beer and coffee menu. We were pretty set on getting a bottle of wine and he was more than happy to suggest some great reds on the menu. He also told us it was happy hour so it was $3 off a bottle of wine! SCORE!  The atmosphere is absoutely gorgeous at night. Dimmed lighting, clean and modern spaces to work on and sit back and enjoy in as we sipped our wine. I even saw the back patio getting a refreshed spritz of water over the succulents. The ambiance of this coffee and wine spot is definitely worth checking out and coming to especially around happy hour.  Music was low and unobtrusive and overall the place was calm and quiet. We were given a nice helping of nuts and snacks that were made in house and had the best herbs and roasted nuts in town! WOOZA! It was delicious!  I will have to come back and try some coffee since this shop is right in my neighborhood. Forget Starbucks down the road...come here to Patika.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"As someone who both has a caffeine addiction and has worked in the cafe industry I have to say Patika is far and away the best cafe in Austin! The management is pleasant and wonderful, and the staff friendly and knowledgable. Everything feels like home, with a simple, and yet ingeniously designed interior that is warm and comfortable. Every time I go notice some cute detail that I hadn't seen before.  When I say the staff is knowledgable I'm not kidding. Every shot is perfectly measured, pressed and poured. They carry quality beans and their cold brew is fantastic and completely not acidic. Their alcohol selection is solid as well.  To not just sing their praises and stan over them this whole review they do have a very small selection of drinks and food. But even then it's the mindset of know what you do and do it well. They may not have the selection other cafes do, but unlike other cafes anything you order is going to be the best you've had.  Their baked goods are stellar, their baker (a lucky hire straight out of school) is one of the best bakers in the city. And their items are at times avant garde and yet always amazing. (If you can get your hands on their Chicken and Waffles donut it's a must)  If you haven't been to this cafe yet you must. And you'll probably see me there.",1
Coffee Shop 51,One of the best italian style coffee in Austin. The place is super well decorated with a great taste.,1
Coffee Shop 51,"I'm probably the thousandth person to zoom by Patika in my car even while looking for it! It's very small and easy to miss amongst some brighter and bigger buildings on SOLA.  Once I turned around and got back on track, I was in love! The staff were friendly, my coffee was delicious, and this spot was so cozy. I wish that I lived closer because if I did, I would probably have a Patika problem!",1
Coffee Shop 51,"So friendly and great mocha and chai tea. Love the music. Can't believe anyone would go to Radio, when this place is 100x better.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"I only have it 4 stars instead of 5 bc of parking. Parking is a little limited, but it's not impossible to find a spot. It surely doesn't stop me from coming back though.  It's a small place, but it's charming. It's a bit bigger on the inside than I expected. Lot of natural light and space.  I've only tried getting a soy cappuccino so far, and it's pretty up there on my list of favorite coffees. I'll have to go back and try the others.  Also, I'm a big fan of the pastries. I got the chicken cilantro turnover, and sweet baby Jesus I need to have more. Definitely worth my $4. Soy cappuccino and chicken cilantro turnover",1
Coffee Shop 51,Great local cafe they take their coffee very seriously. The French press and cortado is fantastic. I love their pastries. Haven't been for jazz nights but it's always buzzing here. Love it!,1
Coffee Shop 51,"Great coffee. Perfect pour. Live music and cocktail hours at night adds a major plus.  I don't usually crave coffee but for this place, I do.",1
Coffee Shop 51,"Patika is the best coffee shop in Austin, hands down.  I have visited Patika 6 or 7 times since it recently opened on Lamar, and every visit has left me more than satisfied. With an inventive chef, welcoming staff, and a hip atmosphere, I don't think I will ever visit another coffee shop on the south side.  Here's why:  The COFFEE is consistently delicious.  The selection of PASTRIES (particularly the breakfast cakes, of which I've had a few) are unique and baked to perfection. The chef really knows what she is doing. The spiced nuts and cookies are so so great!  STAFF are incredibly friendly and customer-service oriented. On multiple visits I have received free samples of snacks and pastries.  The afternoon MENU of snacks, beers, and wines is small but diverse and high quality.  the ATMOSPHERE is hip and simplistic, the way that a coffee shop should be.  The CAR PARKING is sufficient and I have only once struggled to find parking, but this was on a night when there was an event at the coffee shop.  BIKE PARKING is visible from inside the coffee shop, which is great if you want to keep an eye on your bike.  forgot to add: MUSIC: Patika has a great playlist!  Overall would I recommend Patika to a friend?: YES, this would be the first coffee shop I would recommend no matter where your relative location in Austin! Tonights spread: a spiced chai, castelvetrano olives, and roasted spiced pepitas, almonds, cashews, and peanuts. Two of the seven or so beers offered at Patika Wine and Coffee on Lamar Cappuccino @ Patika Wine and Coffee on Lamar",1
Coffee Shop 51,"So my coffee standards are high to start with , so I will say the bar is set out of reach for most. Patika is awesome, they are genuinely nice to you, and make a hell of a good almond latte and cortado. I had the avocado toast a few days ago and it also was impressive. I have never had to wait in line here either but I do go at off times typically, none the less very cool place.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Great place to study or hang out with really good food and coffee. Some seats weren't the most comfortable but there is a selection and there is also a nice outdoor space with seating. Plenty of outlets too, which is nice. This place was way less crowded than a Starbucks, and had a bit more of a quiet vibe. The tables were mostly small, so I wouldn't recommend it for a large group.  Be careful when you are outside, because there were lots of mosquitoes when I went around dusk.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Trendy restaurant and nice atmosphere. You can sit inside or outside. I ordered Chai and Mango field salad. The salad had mixed greens with raspberry, mango, avocado and other fruits. Served with a tangy cilantro Lime dressing. The portion sizes are huge and the price is well worth it. I would like to come back to try more things off their menu. Only 2 drawbacks I experienced - filled up my chai so high that when I picked it up from the bar it spilled over on my hands (hot!) and you have to throw away your trash and put away the plates. If we are paying tip, I feel like full service should be included. Huge cup of chai! I was buzzed the rest of the afternoon.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Very cool, hipster place to get coffee and a light snack in East Austin.  I loved the vibe here.  It is obviously a favorite neighborhood hangout at all times of day.  Both times I visited I had the iced vanilla latte.  It was delish!    My favorite experience was the day they had empanadas as a special.  I tried to bacon and potato empanada.  It was not the empanada of my childhood in Panama, but it was yummy.  There was a spicy guac type of dipping sauce that definitely gave it a kick.  My favorite aspect of this shop was the people watching.  There is a very diverse crowd that visits here and they were all extremely friendly.  If you are looking for inside seating to avoid the heat...Good luck.  Seats were one or two for the taking but groups are pretty limited to the patio areas. My delicious empanada and Iced vanilla latte.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins I dream of this place. On a Sunday morning in NYC, filled with delicious brunch spots, Cenote is what I think of. 100%. If you are in Austin, I'm marking this as an absolutely must try.  This is a locals spot. You see grad students working on their laptops, people writing screenplays, friends catching up after work, carb loading after yoga. Cenote has this absolutely Austin feel.  What you need to try: 1. Chai latte - dirty. Get that espresso shot. It doesn't matter if it's iced or hot. This is one of the best chai lattes I have ever had. 2. ALL THE BREAKFAST TACOS. I love the migas taco for the texture of the tortilla strips. The chorizo has so much flavor. One taco can fill you but two will put you in a happy food coma. 3. $4 mimosa? Done. 4. Potatoes. 5. All brunch items are fantastic. $13 for tacos and a latte. That's the best price point for amazing food.  This is definitely not a large group place. Parties of four or less are the best way to go. Also, if you're ordering a drink, remember to grab it from the counter before you sit down. Either way, Cenote is one of my favorite places in Austin and best breakfasts/brunches that I've had. Whether or not you're living in Austin or visiting, going to Cenote is always a good idea. All breakfast tacos and chai lattes See all photos from Kathryn T. for Cenote",1
Coffee Shop 11,"The food was surprisingly excellent! We had three appetizers during happy hour, half off until 7pm! Can't beat that deal. The root vegetables were a surprising hit for an appetizer, but goat cheese rarely steers me wrong. The 'lasagna' was more like mousaka, but that's taking nothing from it - excellent. We also had the yucca fries which are more like hashed cakes. I liked these a lot, but the 'chutney' was a bit too sweet for my tastes - however, the portion was enormous. The staff was not what I'd call 'friendly', and didn't know much about the food, but they were patient and efficient, which is a rare combination. We will definitely return to try the entrees, but we're too full on this trip. $25 with a beer and a coffee is an outstanding deal for this food! Well done! Coffee shops with beer are always a hit.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Great coffee spot to work, grab a drink or lunch. They have great outdoor seating WITH outlets - a rare find. I really enjoy working outside here. The indoor seating fills up fast though. Overall I love this place to work. Great food options too. Latte",1
Coffee Shop 11,"This ain't no grab and go breakfast sandwich. It's also not a $3-4 one.  For about $11-12 I had a bacon, egg, and cheese on ciabatta, and an iced vanilla latte. Since this was my breakfast and lunch (I was studying for the long-term!) I didn't mind. The breakfast sandwich was yummy (I'd do almost anything for a good BEC) and the latte was good as well! Since it is more cafe-style, it's not a place I think to swing by just for coffee, but I enjoy the breakfast!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins On the hunt for a juice place, I came across Cenote (they don't have juice but are located right next to a place that did at one point), and I'm glad our paths crossed. Instead of being healthy and sipping my nutrients through a straw, I instead got to get down with the get down in the form of a torpedo-size bfast taco and iced coffee. The staff was friendly, and my drink and taco came out quickly.  The taco was impressive (not so much the tortilla)...it was a big, lumpy football of eggs, cheese, and bacon; greasy and delicious.  The space has indoor and outdoor seating. The interior, very cafe-y; the exterior, very picnic bench-y. Cute all around! Massive bfast taco and iced coffee",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Did you see my photos? Go look at them. We came here because it's been on my bookmarks for ages and we have fiiiiiinally arrived. The sandwiches. I mean really. For a vegetarian you're in heaven. They've got two veggie options so we went with both. They came out supa dupa fast, big, beautiful, and packed with flavor! They generously fill those big beautiful buns with a ton of veggies and very special sauces.  I was a little worried they would taste the same but they were both totally different. The ""Veggie Sandwich"" was my favorite with massive beets, a big helping of carrots, avo, and sprouts, and chipotle aioli puts it over the edge. The bread was also amazing and crispy on the outside.  The ""Beet It"" Sandwich was filled with spinach, beets, and tomato pesto concoction. Very very good. We will be back. Beer and coffee! Beet it sandwich The veggie sandwich",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Listed in Austin Guide Came here for brunch.  It's a very ""Austin"" place with its quirky paint scheme and a large metal octopus outside and multiple porches.  Basically, someone just renovated a house and turned it into a restaurant.  I had the BBQ Grilled Chicken sandwich ($12), which was quite good.  Cenote was packed when we visited, so it took a while to get our food.  They weren't doing a great job bussing the tables, so we had to wipe down our own outside.  When we were done, we were unclear if we were supposed to clear our plates (we did) or let an employee do it.  There was a pile of used plates in a bin next to a garbage can swarming with flies, which is a fun way to end your meal.  Cenote draws a crowd, so it's a little hectic.  Probably better enjoyed at a slower time of day... BBQ Grilled Chicken sandwich - $12",1
Coffee Shop 11,"We came to Cenote for the free cheese board and stayed for the Fried Picante Chicken Mac and cheese. Antonelli's Cheese was having a free cheese special at participating restaurants around town a few weeks ago and that night one of the specials was at Cenote. I had my eye on Cenote's breakfast menu for a while, so I figured their dinner entrees must be just as appealing. Cenote looks like a normal coffee shop from the inside. People on their laptops, smell of espresso, etc., but they do have a kitchen and they also serve booze.  Luckily we arrived just in time to get a free cheese plate. It had three Antonelli's cheeses, strawberries in some kind of strawberry sauce, honey, crushed roasted nuts, and bread. Needless to say I ate the entire thing. Boyfriend ordered their Mac and Cheese which had fried chicken and picante in it. It was fantastic.  Also, be sure and check out their website, because they have different specials each weekday night. Wednesday is 1/2 bottles of wine (they've got sparkling too). Oh and there's a really nice outdoor seating space as well. Fried Picante Chicken Mac & Cheese Cheese plate. It was free tonight because of Antonelli's 6th anniversary.",1
Coffee Shop 11,Best Migas I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of Migas at places all over Texas.  Shared that and a fresh fruit parfait with my wife.  Served quickly despite the place. Ring packed.  Friendly staff and really cool location in an old house.  Not far from where I went to Jr High School (Martin).,1
Coffee Shop 11,"4 check-ins Listed in Best of the East Side, Austin does Brunch! Popular east Austin cafe serving good coffee (really!) and a nice selection of salads, sandwiches, and on the weekends Texas breakfast classics.    There are Plenty of vegetarian options, but I recommend anything with bacon. The pork belly banh mi is one of my favorite sandwiches: marinated meat  on a crunchy bread, with a spicy sauce that adds a fusion Texan flavor, a twist on the ha noi original.  Penty of bike parking, a bit harder to find a place for your car on busy weekends. Southwest Cesar salad. The roast corn is delicious! Pork belly baby",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Cenote was a definite favorite on our recent cross country trip!  We went here twice in one day--that's how much we loved it... The atmosphere was probably the best part of all, even in the rain the surrounding outside space, decks and people were enough to make you want to move in and never ever leave.  We got an americano, cold brew and a heavenly brownie. If you're in the area and you're looking for a great spot, go here, do not hesitate for a second!  Also, pick up a book across the street and then enjoy if with your coffee :) It was dark and rainy so this was all I got -- but go here. It's fantastic!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Café or restaurant? I'm not sure and I'm not sure the owners know either. Looks nice on the outside, but the inside was small and crowded. I was pretty annoyed to find that seating was limited since most seats were taken by people on their laptops with 1 coffee. Came here for lunch and they have a full menu, so I went ahead and got the Cenote Smoke Burger with a side of chips & salsa. The burger was ok, but very messy. The chips were stale. The pictures online made the place look great and perhaps I should have tried something else. If a café style is what is working for them, they should emphasis that more. I wasn't satisfied and I wouldn't come back. Cenote Smoke Burger with a side of chips and salsa",0
Coffee Shop 11,"Local cafe with good food. The crowd is a mix of people on their computers and groups of people in for a meal. The service is quick and the food is good. The outdoor seating is great, but the weather didn't permit us to sit out there. There is a parking lot behind the building.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Such an east Austin, hipster, trendy spot. Good food at fair prices and with healthy quality also. Super insta worthy place, especially on days with nice weather, as the majority of the cafe is an outdoor patio area.  Fish tacos were surprisingly delicious for a cafe, non mex spot. Excellent flavors and a nice small salad of greens to accompany the dish.  Mango fields salad was simple and light, but nothing special. Perfect for if you want a refreshing light meal or snack though.  My only drawbacks of cenote would be the lack of parking, lack of availability of some menu items, long line that we encountered, and the long wait- all signs of a popular venue, but we were expecting an in and out, order at the counter and get your food right away type place. So make sure to set aside enough time to enjoy your meal here because it might take a while! Fish tacos Mango fields salad- not much mango though :/",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Just across I-35 from downtown in a little neighborhood in East Austin. Funky and hipster coffeehouse vibe. Great breakfast choices ranging from tacos and burritos to bagels. Specialty espresso and coffee drinks. Hubby loved his breakfast burrito that had bacon, egg, Cheese and potatoes stuffed in it. I lived my breakfast tacos (bacon and and cheese). Ordered two since I figured they were fairly small at only$3.50 each. I was wrong! Could have gotten by with only one, but they were so good I finished them off.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Came here three times on a quick trip to Austin for the excellent coffee, great food, and good vibes. Looked busy sunrise to sunset so I must not be only one that feels that way.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Man, the menu always looks really good and I always really *really* want to like Cenote, but unfortunately I always seem to leave disappointed.  Today, I ordered the crispy tofu with broccoli & roasted eggplant with a side of rice. I was expecting fried tofu with fresh broccoli and roasted eggplant. I also ordered a side of broccoli without sauce for my 9 month old baby. I was assured that it was ""no problem""  What came to us was greasy battered deep fried eggplant with deep fried tofu and 2 tiny florets of deep fried broccoli.  Instead of steamed broccoli, she brought heavily oiled roasted potatoes for my 9 month old.  I left confused and feeling gross.  I'm sorry Cenote, but I think might just have to quit you...",0
Coffee Shop 11,"3 check-ins Have done breakfast here, have just run in for coffee, have done Happy Hour with wine and snacks here...needless to say, Cenote is a versatile option and it is always delicious.  The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, and the food is great...what more do you need?",1
Coffee Shop 11,Cool little coffee shop serving delicious cappuccinos and tastes breakfast options that are better than the usual hipster bread offerings.  Breakfast taco is a must try!,1
Coffee Shop 11,"My running group started and ended our run at Cenote recently and we stayed for breakfast once the run was complete. I am sure the other patrons were thankful we sat outside so we didn't stink up the place.    One of the first things I noticed at 8am on a Saturday was the completely reasonable beer prices.  $2 tall boys, and a variety of local taps for $4 - $5 each.   If I lived near here I would probably come in for beers sometimes just because the prices are solid.  On the food side, I had the breakfast sandwich with Egg, Avacado, and Cheese.   I don't usually dig on Ciabatta bread, but this sandwich was solid.  Needless to say, if I am ever int he neighborhood and I want a beer or a sandwich, Cenote will probably spring to mind.",1
Coffee Shop 11,I wasn't a huge fan of this place but now that they've revamped their menu a bit I feel like I can go here more often. It's one of my best friend's favorite places so I've dined here a bit more previously than in the past! I've taken vegan friends here and picky eaters here and there's literally something for everyone.  A few notes on their new menu: I split their burger once with my friend and it was great! (although a bit hard to eat as it was massive).  I've also had their mango salad and thought it was pretty good. Then I ordered their arepas and they were pretty good but SUPER salty. Almost so salty it was hard to eat..so definitely the food has been mixed for me. Would try some other things as well. I love that they have a very spacious patio that is great for spring hanging out in Texas as well as working during the day.  I love that they have coffee as well as beer and wine. The guy at the register cracked me up in line so that alone is worth coming back for.,1
Coffee Shop 11,"Came here for a quick morning breakfast before my flight - - Chai Latte - It was one of the best Chai Latte I've ever had.  Although I don't usually go to coffee joints, I definitely could see myself starting to if I live next to a place with concoction like this. - Turkey Avocado Sandwich: To be honest I didn't expect much for this sandwich; I mean it's just a regular sandwich right? A sandwich is a sandwich...So i thought.  As I picked up the sandwich I noticed how toasted and crisp the bread was, and I knew deep down they took special care of this piece of work; and the first bite?  The flavors, the freshness of the ingredients, and the texture of the bread with avocado meshed and fused into a power level 9000 sandwich....wait what are we talking about here again...?  LOL Chai Latte!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"I was very impressed with Cenote.  They have coffee, beer, solid food and a fun atmosphere.  I will be back here the next time I visit.  I ended up with a pint of 512 brown ale and some fish tacos.  The tacos were pretty awesome and the beer was a great pairing with it.  Pro-tip 1, you sort of seat yourself here.  You place your order at the counter and they give you a number.  If you have a group, it might be easier to stalk a table first and then order separately.  Pro-tip 2, they were awesome about my wife's food allergies.  I don't know if they necessarily bill themselves as being allergy conscious but it was easy for them.  This was a pleasant surprise on our trip and I highly recommend it.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins I'm glad i don't live in Austin because I'd overkill my daily chai intake. Cenote has the best iced chai that I have ever tasted! Just that drink itself would make me come back.  My friends got the burrito, parfait (which I heard was exceptional), oatmeal and the migas and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the special which was prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula on ciabatta bread and it wasn't too bad! I would come here again for the atmosphere and outdoor seating. The patio is so huge and it's dog friendly. Iced chai latte never disappoints! Cozy indoor that has trees painted on the wall to match the theme of the greenery & outdoor patio.",1
Coffee Shop 11,Very cute place and delicious coffee. I tried the mocha latte.  Definitely would come back to just relax and enjoy the calm ambience.,1
Coffee Shop 11,"14 check-ins This place has got to be one of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. Parking is always a bit tricky but absolutely worth it.  If you can't find parking right near the front there's always a spot on 2nd street just behind it.  This place has a very unique vibe to it, I bit hip and funky I'd say. Located a few blocks from i35 on the corner of Cesar Chavez and Medina. There are lots of tables outside even a smoothie bar located right out front which is ran separately.  Okay so why my favorite? Where do I begin, let's see. First and foremost their coffee is some of the best tasting in the area. I'm a big fan of their cortado and if you like chi tea they make their chi In house  it's suburb. I've tried many dirty chi lattes around town and this is the best. Mmmm .. Okay then I love the fact that it's a coffee shop with wifi so you can get some work done but they also have beer on tap! Yep, that's right, grab some local craft beer while you're here. Then lastly, their food is bomb. The breakfast taco is HUGE and only $3.50. Sausage egg and cheese is where it's at. I had their chicken Pozole soup once and I've been craving it ever since. Let's see what else have I had, their oatmeal is good, comes in a huge bowl. And today actually I tried their tomato zucchini soup, pretty tasty.  And the atmosphere never gets old. Great spot, great people and the staff have always been so so very friendly. I'm a regular! Breakfast tacos are huge and only $3.50. One is filling enough for me. See all photos from Tiffany S. for Cenote",1
Coffee Shop 11,"The staff is not friendly. I come here all the time though because it's in walking distance from where I live. Today I ordered the oatmeal and asked for extra strawberries. The guy looked at me like I had five heads & said it doesn't come with strawberries. I said 'it says on the menu it has strawberries & I have eaten it probably 5 times here'. He just said with zero care in the world 'it comes with raisins'. I was so annoyed, I left. It does come with strawberries- learn your menu and have better customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 11,"Their sandwiches, OMG SO GOOD! HUGE and I couldn't even finish all. I will be back to try their sandwich with beet!  just be warned that the line can get LONG but worth the waiting. Iced lattes with chicken flautas and grande breakfast burritos with my love.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Delicious food, cool atmosphere and big patio.  Make sure you pay attention to what menu you are looking at because it changes and the burgers sound the same but they are very different. Both pretty good though.",1

Coffee Shop 11,"Really nice breakfast place with some great coffee. Sat outside, not sure why there are so many flies out here or if it's just an Austin thing, but they do have fans to keep the air flowing. It's a clean place with some solid breakfast tacos. Plenty of seating inside and out.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Iced coffee tastes so good when it's cold brew and there's 6+ different sugar and milk options to add. Good place to get some work done. A little dark, but has a cute East Austin charm that isn't overwhelming or pungent in any sense. Wouldn't mind if it was 24 hours. Will be returning to try other drinks, if their iced coffee wasn't so addicting.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins What use to be a house now a cozy cafe with street parking. The parking behind it? That is reserved for the real house where people live. Friday nights are open mic comedy night (outside) with regulars who attend. The cafe offers plenty of options for drinks and also food and pastries. Heads up, the floors are beautiful hard wood and the sound of boots will echo. Very nice patio area with plenty of shade.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins Grunge jams in a 100 year old east Austin house, with delicious Wild Gift coffee and migas.  The migas plate was better than expected in a beautiful extra crispy and greasy kinda way. But, the best part of this place is the staff and the beautiful house and patio. I love the vine enclosed patio. One of the servers would soulfully never know the lyrics but still sing along, and the guy who checked me out was super friendly and reminded me to GET HYPED about game of thrones tonight. Cleganebowl. I thought it was fun to think that my 14 year old self and 28 year old self would equally enjoy hanging here.",1
Coffee Shop 11,I got the GF French toast plate and the chai tea latte.  The Amazing: 1. Gluten-free French toast is one of he best I've had. I did not even have to add any syrup. It was delicious 2. The potatoes had one hell of a seasoning.  The OK:  3. Scrambled eggs were good but nothing special 4. Chai Tea latte it's just ok,1
Coffee Shop 11,"Was excited to stop in, treat myself and friend to breakfast and coffee and try a new place. Sadly disappointed and felt ripped off.  I was ordering to go bc my friend was at home although the best aspect of this place is probably the cool house and yard.  Even though I was still tipping 20% and I'm always polite, the Cashier was impatient and rude. Didn't tell me that my coffee was going to be on the other side of the counter, so it sat there and got cold for 20m while I waited for my food. Not only was it cold but it wasn't good, like if you go to hipster or nicer coffee shop you expect to get great coffee but this was very disappointing.  Got home to see ""Omelette"" was just charred scrambled eggs with stuff thrown on top. Not an omelette and the charred part may have to do with the cleanliness of the grill (see pictures for blackened bits). Ingredients were good but I wish I had known it was more of a scrambled frittata than an omelette.  Breakfast tacos were equally lazily thrown together and charred. Greasy. Taco wasn't even wrapped closed, broken foil and potatoes falling out.  The cute house with yard and juice bar connected and idea of going to a locally owned coffee shop is the only great thing about this place. Probably the only reason why there were so many customers.  Idk maybe the cook was fired or quit and it was a cashier or barista trying to make food in the kitchen. Maybe they don't care. It really seemed like they gave zero cares. I wish they did, though. It could be better. I'm going to call this the Charred scrambled frittata bc it is clearly not an Omelette Charred, messy, greasy, broken foil and stuff falling out, corn tortilla was grainy",0
Coffee Shop 11,"I went yesterday and got myself a soy latte and their breakfast omelet.  When I first walked in, I couldn't see anybody who was not wearing black frame glasses or infinity scarves, so this gives you an idea of what kinda place this is.  As for the latte, it tasted like someone just said fuck it and put foamed up brown water in a latte cup. So I walked up to the counter with my crippled leg and ask if they can make it stronger, and the girl went ""if you have a dollar I can add another shot of espresso"". Well what a great business model - serve a coffee that's shit, and charge people more when they want actual coffee instead of lukewarm brown liquid. Plus they could've been nicer about it! 0/5  The omelet I ordered - it was the only reason this place didn't receive 1 star. To give them credit it was very delicious but they should've called it a scramble instead of omelet. See picture and you will get what I meant. What happened to the egg blanket that was supposed to wrap up the insides of my omelet? Is this place THAT hipster that their omelets don't even need wrapping because it's too mainstream? I was very confused.  To sum up: neither of the things I ordered here came out like they were supposed to. It's a good place to go if you like to be surprised. The ""soy latte"" I ordered aka warm brown water The ""omelet"" I got",0

It's one of my favorite places in town to read, get some work done, or catch up with friends. Also, it's in a cute, rustic house that offers indoor and outdoor seating options.  Lastly, they have a killer playlist that has me awkwardly Shazaming every 5 minutes.  One of my favorite places in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Breakfast food + outdoor seating = All I need to be a satisfied customer. I was really excited to come try this place and I'm glad I did! A few of my girl friends and I came by for some breakfast early Saturday morning and it was packed in here. They have two lines to take customers' orders and the line went out to the door. Even in midst of the busy morning, I was well taken care of and the workers behind the register are people-loving people. They make small talk/ conversations with you and it was a good way to start off my morning. The food was great- with lots of flavors! The weather was nice so we decided to sit outside and they brought us out our food. My Americano, however, I had to go to the bar to get myself. It was really a crowded wait for the water and my coffee- I wish they had more room or another dispenser for water to make it less hectic! Overall, I had a great time dining here.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"This place is pretty awesome.  Love the outdoor wrap around patio and garden seating, plus the indoor vibe is pleasant and uncramped. The outdoor art is a fun touch -- I regret not taking a selfie with their big green bullfrog statue. The interior space is lovely as well with high ceilings and turquoise walls.  Besides the aesthetic, the cubano sandwich was fantastic, and we tried the Cobb salad as well. It was gorgeous and tasty! For the price and variety on the menu, what's not to love here?  It was five o'clock somewhere, so we tried their seasonal mango sangria and were not disappointed. The portion was generous and it made for a refreshing palate cleanser on a hot day. The fresh chunks of strawberry and mango provided a healthy dessert too. ;)",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins I love love love this place!  Their coffee is awesome - strong, but not bitter, smooth, creamy, and has almost no acidity.  The first time I came here I just ordered a drink but the second time I ordered food as well.  The turkey club that I got was definitely a generous portion but it wasn't all that great (I think it needed some crispier bacon and slightly softer bread).  It wasn't bad though and I would be willing to try something else the next time I go.  The best part about this place are the generous seating options.  There are benches in the front if you want to sit picnic/family style and there are smaller tables and chairs in the back - all shaded.  It feels like you're sitting in your friend's backyard.  The decor is incredibly cozy and cute all around, a perfect spot to catch up with a friend or to bring a date.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"I am more so reviewing the place in it's entirety. The food isn't great but it's better than expected for coffeeshop food. But the atmosphere and the darling outdoor seating on the front porch is what brings me back. There is a good amount of indoor seating and a ton outdoor. It's a great place to come early on a weekend morning (not past 10, it gets crazy busy), have good coffee, and enjoy the weather. Also a great place to grab a drink with a friend (less busy at night) and sit on the porch -- I did this recently when it was raining, and it was beautiful.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"When we arrived at a little after 10:30 am on September Sunday morning, there was a line out the door to order, but several open places to sit both inside and out.  We were able to order within 15 minutes of arriving and food came out shortly thereafter.  Cenote is both an excellent coffee shop and dining establishment.  This old frame house with interior painted walls depicting trees is filled with charm and serves high quality coffee and food.  The latte that we ordered was smooth, well foamed, and without bitterness.  There is plenty of seating at tables and the wifi speeds are a respectable 13 Mpbs download (I've managed to do work using VoIP at 1.5 Mbps).  The bread on the turkey avocado sandwich was soft and moist, and the sandwich ingredients were piled high.  Everything was fresh and the added bacon for $2 made it that much better.  The salmon salad was surprisingly large, served in a chilled bowl was a giant portion of kale, garnished with slices of beets, halved grape tomatoes, nuggets of goat cheese and dressed with sumac yogurt and a fennel vinaigrette and topped with freshly cooked salmon filets.  Very fresh, very filling and reasonably priced.  It was hard to choose what to order (grilled breakfast burritos and chilaquiles were vying for my attention), and I'm eager to go back to try more of the menu.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Cenote is a quaint, counter-serve restaurant located in the heart of one of Austin's oldest and most eclectic neighborhoods. The interior evokes all the charm and character of the rustic, DIY design that's come to define the I-35 corridor. The menu, while lean in the number of its offerings, provides both variety and quality at a tremendous value. Meals are prepared in short order and delivered hot to your table by a staff that is professional and engaging. Cenote is great for a midday or evening meal, but I'm partial to their breakfast offerings which include burritos and freshly ground coffee/espressos.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"A solid five stars for Cenote!!! LOVE their ambiance, the seating, their healthy menu, and their AMAZING coffee!

Coffee Shop 11,"I was in search of a place that lives the ZFG (0 Effs Given) lifestyle and had just about given up.  You see, after years of slaying dragons and destroying villages, I am in no mood to deal with some east side slime ball who would judge the motor oil in my beard and compare it to the fragrant lotion that he uses in his.    No, I want raw, unapologetic, real deal people with strong attitudes and stronger coffee.  As I first walked into Cenote, the sweet sounds of Pantera blasting out of the PA system immediately put my mind at ease.  The gentle giant behind the counter was kind enough not to break my nose after noticing my hulk hogan tshirt (it's still real to me dammit) and even gave me a solid ""whats up dude"" greeting.  The coffee was quick, hot and punched my guts so hard I was a prisoner in the restroom for 20 min.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins I've only visited here in the morning, it is an excellent place for breakfast. High quality coffee paired with a great atmosphere. The breakfast burrito here is probably the best I've ever had. You can tell they put some effort into the recipe instead of just throwing stuff in a tortilla. There are some great subtle flavors that show the quality here.  There is a discount if you pay with cash which is super cool. My only critique is the $1 charge for a coffee refill. 50¢ would be more appropriate. Overall, a great Austin gem.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"The ambiance, food, and coffee here is really enjoyable. It gets pretty packed, but it's a good study spot.

There was plenty of seating outside, but with the heat we chose to sit inside and it was packed! It's obviously loud too. They periodically have comedy shows here. After working for a bit we developed quite the appetite. I was in a picky mood initially and wanted to go somewhere else for food.

Coffee Shop 11,"3 check-ins I'll come here repeatedly for the Cobb salad. I'm not a coffee officionado but I've heard from others this place gets two thumbs up.  I also often hesitate about coming here because parking can be tough and finding a good seat, especially for 2+ people is a real skill.  BUT when the stars align and neither of the above are a hassle I'm always very happy with the food and beverages. I'm especially happy when I land a seat on their gorgeous vintage couch.

They have a patio outside, and a bunch of different areas you can choose to study. I'd say half of the seating is inside, and the other half is outside.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2nd visit to cenote...  And unfortunately the 2nd visit left a bad taste in my mouth.  For starters, the staff is unfriendly and uninviting. Not a big deal, as long as the food is good, I could really care less.  Onto the food:  Eggs were burnt. Oatmeal was basically poured in Luke warm water and served. Disgusting. The bacon is poor quality and under cooked.  On a better note, the coffee was OKAY.  Probably won't be back which is a shame bc this place is beyond cozy and cute.",0
Coffee Shop 11,"We were looking for a good brunch spot for my dad's birthday and all of our favorites were really booked up! I had been to cenote before for a coffee, and I remembered that they had food so I suggested it. We had SUCH a great meal, and with quick and super friendly service. I had a tempeh bahn mi taco trio, my mom had their apple butter waffles, and my dad had the kale scramble with a hatch pepper on top. We all couldn't stop stealing from each others plates. Every single thing was delicious. Not to mention the place is super cute and cozy, with plants everywhere! I love it and will come back often.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"5 check-ins Visiting Austin for work and my friend suggested Cenote fro breakfast. OMG, YES! I had the breakfast wrap with FRESH bacon,  FARM eggs, cheese and potatoes. This wrap could feed an army! He had the ""Classic"" eggs, YUMMY bacon, potatoes, toast and butter like you've never tasted.  I loved the cappuccino so much I had to buy the fresh beans. They flavor was called Trouble Maker.  AH, what a perfect name :)  Its a place your order at the counter and seat yourself. They bring the food to you and someone calls out your coffee order when its ready.   ADORABLE space to sit and chill with your coffee. Saw lots of laptops out while they were enjoying their breakfast.  Got there just after 8 and by 8:30 it was quite packed so obviously this is a ""go-to"" place.  I'd guess it gets packed on the weekends.  Enjoy!!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Listed in Hipsterland I did it - I stood in line and Instagram'd a billion pictures of my food like the typical hipster millennial that I am. My free trade coffee and coconut black tea looked so good in the Valencia filter, you should try it! It's very representative of Austin's ""Keep Austin Weird"" motto which I'm still slowly catching on to! All their teas are made from the organic Zhi teas and their coffee is put through a nitro draft system! This place is hipster wonderland and honestly my new happy place. I only stopped for a quick drink while I was here but I have heard wonderful things about their tacos so I will be updating this review after I revisit this establishment to continue this twee affair.",1
Coffee Shop 11,Great for coffee cold or hot. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great vibes and atmosphere. We had an iced chai and iced mocha during a hot afternoon. Both drinks were great. Inside half finished Iced Chai (left) and Iced Mocha (right) both were great,1
Coffee Shop 11,"Food is out of this world. People are awesome, food is awesome, vibe is awesome. Just do it. Go here right now. Do itttttt.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Lovely place.  It is a cozy looking house inside a neighborhood.  Once you find parking,  the inside is comfy and relaxing.  I ordered bacon breakfast tacos with avocado which were filling and tasted fresh.  The salsa was great and simple complement.  I didn't know what kind of coffee to try so I opted for a latte with almond milk.  Not a bad choice and the coffee didn't taste like crap.  Overall,  I would like to come back and try the rest of the menu and maybe a different kind of coffee. Latte with almond milk.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"While in town for a conference, I popped in for a late breakfast / early lunch. The place was deservedly busy for the off-peak hour. Servers were chill. Customers were all sorts of people. Though it is one of those classic dishes repurposing leftovers, the migas I had were fresh and plentiful as well as a pretty dish. Coffee was delicious, as seems to be par for the course in Austin. migas, al fresco in the January sun",1
Coffee Shop 11,"This was my first time at Cenote and it was a pretty good experience. I was there for an interview/meeting and was a little nervous when I ordered, but the guy at the register was funny and eased my nerves a bit.  I got their cold brew and liked that their honey and sugar was right next to their pick up window.  I don't know how recent this is but they do have a parking lot a block down, it's a grass lot so after a day of rain it'll most likely be all mud. Regardless the parking was what I was most worried about so it wasn't that big of a deal.",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Love this place and bike here frequently, but they gotta stop raising their mimosa prices! I can get one cheaper at the four seasons!!!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"2 check-ins Although Yelp has made it difficult to find a bad meal in Austin, I think my fellow Yelpers has sold Cenote short!  Great atmosphere, close to downtown but not in all the crowded hassle. Cenote is a cool oasis on The trendy east side. I came in during the dinner rush and had no problems getting the order in or finding a table. The salmon and kale salad was excellent!  Just-right salmon atop a bed of tender kale greens with beets, carrots, pecans, blue cheese, and a tasty vinaigrette. A lot going on in that bowl, but absolutely delicious. Thanks Sara P. for the recommendation   If you're n Austin, get out to Cenote any time of the day for good food. Kale and salmon salad",1
Coffee Shop 11,Awesome sandwiches. Great coffee. This place is definitely worth a visit and I will definitely go back. It gets pretty busy on the weekends but there is a lot of seating (both indoor & outdoor).  Cashier recommended the Turkey Avocado sandwich and i loved it.,1
Coffee Shop 11,"Dedicated baristas, never a bad latte, delicious food, Instagram   picturesque, Austin-vibe, colorful and all around awesome at all hours of the  day!",1
Coffee Shop 11,"Misleading reviews. Worst espresso I've ever had, and sorely disappointing experience.",0
Coffee Shop 11,"In Austin from San Antonio for my nieces wedding. Found Cenote as a local recommendation.  I had their house salad which included avocado and cilantro vinaigrette dressing. I was impressed with the large serving for the price; wonderful tasting. Followed that with the perfectly prepared Seared Atlantic Salmon which sat over a bed of couscous, tomato confit, basil, & kale. This was ""presentation"" and taste to match! Yes I had to have the cappuccino ~",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I was in Austin for a few days and needed to find somewhere to get some work knocked out...this was the perfect place for that!  I went in the morning hours so they had their breakfast tacos out and the place was hopping. Let me give you a couple tips because I obviously went in clueless on how the place worked but soon figured it out. If there is a line go and grab your tacos out of the crockpot first and then get into line. They have around 6 different versions which are labeled in paper bags. They also have salsa available. They are smaller tacos but one was the perfect amount for me.  Grab a cold brew, it's completely delicious and will get you completely ready for a productive day. They even offer $1.00 refills but I didn't need one due to the perfect state the first one put me in. Seating is pretty plentiful and restrooms were clean. It definitely seemed like a hotspot for meetings too. Check this place out!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I come here for the espresso.  At one time or another I have spent time at almost all of the coffee shops in Austin, and I only drink espressos. Many of the coffee shops/cafes in Austin have a specific type of espresso, and it has a very tangy/fruity/acidic taste. I'm not a big fan of this espresso taste. Call me traditional, but I like my espresso to be dark, chocolaty, smooth, and Italian.  There aren't too many places in Austin that serve up traditional espresso, but the Hideout Coffeehouse is one of them. They use Katz coffee, and they pull incredibly smooth shots that don't have that very sharp after taste. So if you're looking for a place with chill vibes to relax or study, and have a good espresso I would recommend this place.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"When you walk in the place feels very Austin-y despite being in downtown Austin.  Or maybe I just loved it because all the tables were filled with people there by themselves. I came in waiting for a friend for happy hour, but this is a great place to come with a book or with work if you're downtown. I did not get a coffee drink this visit, but I did order a grilled cheese and appreciate they have food-- they even have hoboken pie by the slice!!  I gave 4 stars for a small menu. I'm excited to go back and try more, but it did seem limited.  Side note: I was panhandled here from a guy asking for money. I saw the barista ask him to leave, I understand people need money but as a single girl downtown 8 hours of the day, I appreciated this jester from the barista.  I was also panhandled recently at starbucks across the street and they did nothing. I'm from Austin, love Austin, and appreciate when businesses help me feel safer in downtown Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I love the vibes in this place! ""D"", a barista here, is so friendly and helpful. It was my first time visiting and she was great. I had a rosemary sea salt bagel with hummus to spread with a medium roast coffee and it was yummy! I came back a next time and got an almond milk latte and a turkey Pesto sandwich. The sandwich was huge and a little too much cheese and grease but overall pretty good!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Great little coffeehouse right on Congress Ave.  Cold Brew is on point and if you plan on doing work the refills are inexpensive.  I opted to get some work e-mails done AND stream golf on a Sunday on my iPad. Internet was able to support both. Plenty of power as they have surge protectors throughout.  Bonus: Breakfast Tacos!!! Amazing! I didn't try anything other than the cold brew and the tacos, but other goodies looked fresh and delicious. Doing work and watching golf with my cold brew! Awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Good drinks selection, ice cream, coffee-ice cream shakes, Sugar Mama's cupcakes, gluten-free cookies, sandwiches, breakfast tacos for $2.75, and bagels. For a small shop they keep a pretty large selection of local food products. I didn't try the food but the green tea was delicious and refills are only $1.  My only complaint is that the wifi was a bit on the slower side and it even wasn't packed that day. Otherwise, the chairs are comfy, the vibe is chill, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Good green tea, comfy chairs, laid back vibes.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Great little coffee store in Austin. Plenty of seating, good wifi and coffee. Staff is cool and they have a much better selection of non coffee shop stuff than normal. I had the grilled cheese and it was a big sandwich for $7.50. Don't let the construction next door bother you - the shop is tucked away on Congress and no noise in here.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Who knew there still existed such coziness in Downtown Austin?!  I work in dt, and only visited this coffeehouse yesterday. It was like stepping into an Austin business from 20 years ago. The smell, the furniture, and the intimacy of the place made me incredibly nostalgic.  I got a simple brewed coffee and had it black. It was good and fresh, despite it being the middle of the day. Can't wait to curl up with a book here over a weekend!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Ever since I had the Hideout Hazelnut Latte here, I've been dreaming about coming back for more.  It is possibly the best latte I've ever had in my life.  The foam on top of the latte were like soft, marshmallows against my lips.  I've never felt anything like it, it was so inviting and comforting.  And then, you get the taste of the hazelnut warmth and it's like you're in heaven.  I'm trying to describe this the best I can, but really, it is nondescribable.  You have to go try it for yourself.  I wish this place was closer to me, I would go everyday, twice a day.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Hits all of my marks for a good coffee shop to work in:  - Free, fast Wifi - Good coffee - Great selection of sweet stuff and also a lot of tasty ""real"" food - Comfortable, plush seats  .. and more:  - Friendly people behind the counter - Easy location, right downtown - Cool theater in the back - Lots of sun coming through the big windows",1
Coffee Shop 67,Went to a SXSW event at The Hideout. All in all a great vibe and a delicious coffee. There are tons of great coffee shops in Austin but you should definitley add The Hideout to your list of spots with great drinks with a great vibe.,1
Coffee Shop 67,This is a really cool place. I've been twice. Each time I've had a combination of coffee and drinks.  They have a good selection and their coffee is what you would expect in a divey coffee shop. Meaning good.  The staff are nice and pretty cool to talk to.,1
Coffee Shop 67,"Coffee House + Theatre= I dig it. Its right on Congress Ave so parking is a nightmare, I have only stopped in for coffee and a pastry but would not so much for food. Coffee is fine just fine. Check out the shows they post, those can be pretty good!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"My favorite place for coffee in Austin, both hot and iced, and any of their specialty drinks, they also serve good beer and pastries, I make a point to stop here, usually multiple times, each time I'm here in Austin, friendly staff and cool vibe",1
Coffee Shop 67,"2 check-ins Downtown, and need a place to chill where you can, like, chill?  This is what coffee houses used to be like: cool, comfortable, low-key. The kind of place where you just start up conversations with other people based on their hair or shoes or the phone they're flashing. Cause its easy.  The coffee's good, the prices are fair, the servers look you in the eye, and there's plenty of room to lounge and visit which, on a cold afternoon, is much better than drowning your sorrows in a beer.  Yes, the parking is a bitch: its downtown, remember? But if you want to be treated like a human, meet some interesting peeps and really get to relax even if its just for a few moments, skip the corporate stores and try the Hideout.  You can thank me later. Main sign at The Hideout",1
Coffee Shop 67,Great coffee. Knows how to make a proper flat white and a well balanced latte.  Very friendly barista and great selection of gluten free options.  Hidden gem :),1
Coffee Shop 67,"Great to see a divey joint in the middle of Downtown Austin, and indeed a hidden joint. While the Internet is usable, the connection can be slow. I also felt that the music was a little distracting and a bit aggressive for a cafe. Service was great and quick though. I got the cold brew. If you're looking for a caffeine fix that is generally more affordable in Downtown ATX, consider the Hideout.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Great coffee shop!! Hard to find parking since downtown but if lucky this is a nice hidden gym. Cool, hip Atmosphere. The food there is really good as well and cheap. Good place to socialize with friends or get studying done. Don't sit in the seats in front of the bathroom though because you will hear EVERYTHING!! Banana nut bread and raspberry lemonade!!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"The right amount of sugar and chill. Nice low key coffee shop. All of the quality without any of the snobbishness. Snagged an apple fritter. It was awesome not to sweet and it wasn't dry at all (trying to avoid using the word mo*st) but it was! Also grabbed the gorilla mocha which was super tasty. Not too heavy and just sweet enough. Lots of mochas tend to be too syrupy, but the gorilla was just right",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Went to work here for an hour on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Nice atmosphere. Got a beef and cheese sandwich with some coffee - both were tasty.  I'm removing one star because the guy who served me had a serious attitude. He left me standing waiting to be served while he was writing something in a notebook, and when I said 'Hello' as he came to serve me and he just replied 'Yes?'. Then when I asked for a savory croissant he just said abruptly 'There's none', so I asked if they still had sandwiches to which he said 'Of course we have sandwiches'. Then he threw my credit card back at me on the counter instead of handing it to me. Don't know what's up his ass today but I let it slide. Such a shame mate, be nicer to your customers.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Not an ideal place for studying. I couldn't help but to first notice the music, which was not only super loud but bad too... Just really bad music. And the tables are very small.  My cappuccino was mediocre as well.  Oh and customer service wasn't good either... The guy with the eye-glasses had an attitude. Or he was just careless.",0
Coffee Shop 67,"We are visiting from out of town, staying around the corner at The Driskell. This place is perfect for coffee and a light breakfast. Cool atmosphere, great mocha and wonderful breakfast burritos! Mocha with part of burrito Mocha",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Getting a bite to eat before the show upstairs!  Got the roast beef and cheddar sandwich. It made in front of me, didn't take too long. Plenty of seating. The sandwich came nice & hot. Was not sure if I would like it since it comes with horseradish mayo, but it ended up tasting real good. So I was glad I ordered it, it was also very filling. Nice atmosphere. Would definitely came back again. Roast beef and cheddar sandwich! The counter where u order",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Great talented barista's.  They actually know how to pull a good espresso shot.  Cool vibe here, very relaxed, plenty of seats.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I've been thinking about how I could do this place justice with some words on the internet...for DAYS...and I just can't. I mean, how do you properly communicate to someone the stream of tears you cried, doubled over laughing hysterically or the number of times your ass came up off of your seat in a fit of laughter?!  I came across The Big Bash event listing a few weeks ago while looking for something interesting to do as part of my 30th birthday festivities. This seemed fitting. I had zero idea what to expect, but can I just say that any expectations I did have coming in here were blown out of the water in the first couple of acts.  I've seriously never laughed so hard in my life. It's better than Whose Line is it Anyway, but the same idea...improv that encourages suggestions from the audience and even audience participation. That's right folks, I volunteered to ""help out"", but when they said I'd be doing sound effects for everything Roy did I about passed out. I don't do sound effects...and I definitely don't do them while I'm cracking up. I was in literal tears by the time I sat back down.  I could not have been more impressed with this production or the people in it. Roy, one of the improvers, was also the person I was in contact with ahead of time, and he graciously reserved seats together for our party. So professional and you can tell these entertainers are totally invested in their craft. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been nearly as impressive.  I'm already planning a return trip!",1
Coffee Shop 67,So welcoming and comfortable. Was on a vacation and this place was a savior in the mornings. Made me feel like a local. Great coffee and a wonderful place to plan out the rest of the Austin day.,1
Coffee Shop 67,The staff was welcoming and helpful on finding a coffee drink I would enjoy. I felt comfortable there. the atmosphere of the coffee shop is trendy and feels very local! I would go back in a heartbeat. I loved the almond joy mocha,1
Coffee Shop 67,"Loved the coffee, staff seemed alright and seems like it would be a pretty chill place to work. Can't speak to the after hours comedy stuff but I'd go back for the latte if I'm in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"On my recent trip to Austin for SXSW I knew that  espresso intake was necessary to survive long days of work. As I roamed the streets of downtown I came a Across this little coffee house. The coffee has nothing to do with my star rating, The iced americano I had was great. I really enjoyed the roast they use. The atmosphere was that of a coffee shop, fitting music and low lighting. They had  helpful billboard and a binder full of local events and things to do around town. Unfortunately, the customer service was less than pleasant. Really unwelcoming and rude. I am Glad to be back in Dallas and at My regular shop.",0
Coffee Shop 67,"Great coffee. So good, that we decided to come in 2 nights in a row. Last night was fine, in fact, the lady at the register was very polite and helpful. Today, not so much. Highly disappointed by the extremely rude customer service given by the skinny Caucasian man, mid-thirties, wearing eye glasses. He was not helpful or polite when I asked any questions about the menu. Very short responses and he sounded annoyed that I even asked. I definitely won't be coming here again.",0
Coffee Shop 67,"This is a great place for improv-lovers, seasoned and novice-alike.  I was so intimidated before taking my level 1 class and gained confidence as we progressed.  Andy and Ruby were great and the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful!  And if you're not into the classes, grab a snack and check out their shows - Maestro's fun!!",1
Coffee Shop 67,Had the gorilla mocha which was awesome. We had stayed at the driskill so went here for a light breakfast. Breakfast tacos were just okay. They were a tad gringo for my taste. I really liked laid back environment.,1
Coffee Shop 67,If you don't think the staff here is rude then you must be a Lithuania orphan who was abused by alcoholic nuns your entire childhood. Carrie!! Hey Carrie!!! Don't delete this. This perfectly sums up the patron's experience. If you had ever been here you would know.,0
Coffee Shop 67,"Really a cool ideal, but horrible execution! Save your dollars and go to Star$7#&* for goodness sake, where at least you get what you expect. Every time, I have been disappointed by their snacks and lackluster offerings. If the servers don't want to make...a sandwich, or a shake, for example, they simply DON'T. At least I didn't waste my money this time on a poor exuse for food. Cupcakes=disgustingly dry and old as your granny's drawers ... cannot remeber my other orders, but after tonight I will NOT spend a dime on beverages or food.",0
Coffee Shop 67,STRONGEST coffee I've ever had. The iced coffee is crack. The red eye is crack and then some. I have taken out of town visitors here and they said this was the strongest coffee they'd ever had too.  Thank you so much for the energy and eye twitching. Great prices and good service as well. Good things come to those who drink here!,1
Coffee Shop 67,"My wife and I stopped in to have get 'refueled' and I was very happy with my dirty chai which is chai with a shot of espresso. I typically drink my coffee black, but I really enjoyed the whatever chai they use and would definitely be back at this coffeehouse when back in Austin.  My only problem with this place was the parking situation was a little confusing because in the vicinity there are both free and metered parking but it can be unclear when free parking turns into metered parking.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I was on the hunt for some coffee and Hideout didn't disappoint. I went during the Monday of SXSW so non badge holders were still allowed, but there weren't any seats inside so I had to leave after getting a drink. I got the hideout hazelnut for about $4 and was pretty pleased with it. Usually I'm very wary of these types of specialty coffees because they're loaded with sugar. However I asked for less caramel and sweetness in general, and the barista was really good with that because I loved my drink!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"2 check-ins Definitely keeping it local at this coffeehouse. They make Starbucks quality drinks, keep prices low, and have a handful of other local eating selections for lunch/snacks. The ambiance is fairly quiet so you could actually get work done here as well!  Early morning they have some bomb breakfast tacos, but you gotta get there early.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Delicious staff, amazing coffee. ...or is it the other way around?  Anyway,  Becca is a magician with the beverages :)",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Thought we would check this place out after a long walk around town. Customer service was off. After watching our server scratch his nose several times we asked him which of his blended drinks had ice cream, he said only the espresso rocket. We proceeded to order the choconana blended drink only to discover there was ice creme in it.  Not a big deal but annoying.    We then ordered a frappe which we noticed was blended using a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf blender, which took away from the small coffee ambience. Details matter. So know your menu and go buy your own blender.",0
Coffee Shop 67,Was so excited to try this place and was so disappointed. Ordered two different drinks and got a croissant (was not offered to heat it up).  One the employees seemed annoyed I was even asking questions about a drink. The other employee seemed in a daze and could barely give me easy even change back from my cash. We sadly could not even stomach to finish either of the two coffee drinks.,0
Coffee Shop 67,"I came here to see a friend's show this last weekend. Unique setting with a bar/restaurant on the first floor and theater upstairs. The show was good - small room so make sure to buy tickets on line ahead of time or else there's a good chance it'll sell out! We parked on the street about 4 - 5 blocks away and walked over. We didn't try the food, but it looked good and the little coffee shop looked like a place I'd love to come do some work, chat with a friend, etc.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Stopped in on a sleepy Sunday morning. The crowd was thin, not at all packed like some reviews suggest. The coffee and decor is the best aspects of this place. Their is a Starbucks just down the street but the vibe and tunes are much better here. The croissants were so good we ordered a second breakfast because one was not enough!",1
Coffee Shop 67,The customer service. OH. MY. GOD.  There was one sweet brown headed girl who was sincere and helpful but the shaggy haired blonde seemed like a pretentious jerk. You could tell she was new and trying to learn but he seemed completely bothered by the matter. I asked him a question about the shot sizing and he acted like I asked him to join the NRA. The dude was completely and utterly rude. Not to mention he didn't even look clean. I can't imagine returning until this place revamps it's customer service skills. It also appears that previous bad reviews relayed the same issue.  Plus the place smelled rancid when you walked in. so if they're cleaning skills mirror their people skills it's safe to assume that they are incredibly poor.,0
Coffee Shop 67,"Great coffee. For those used to the amazing coffee in Australia, this place is a winner. Cappuccino.",1
Coffee Shop 67,Went there while at Atx festival in June for Gilmore Girls reunion. I enjoyed the hideout hazelnut so much that I went there two times during my visit. It was the best and I still think about it here in California. The breakfast burritos were also excellent that I had them on both visits. I enjoyed the way the barista hand made the drinks. I can't wait to go back one day.,1
Coffee Shop 67,"Excellent coffee and pumpkin bread, would come back again! Good customer service, can sweeten your coffee with honey too.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Review is for my bfast taco. I have no idea how they made it taste like water. How'd they do that? Anyway, I might be back to try pastries and a drink, but I was so excited to have another breakfast taco stop near work and now I'm just sad :(",0
Coffee Shop 67,"7 check-ins Super cute coffeehouse with a hidden theater in the back, hence the name!  During my stay in Austin, I had my daily coffee from here, double iced americano.  The last day wasn't as good as the others, but overall I'd come back.  Very nice, friendly staff too.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Tickets to the improv brought me here early, in search of good coffee and a yummy dessert to try before the show. Everything in the case was mummified in impressively thick layers of plastic. Anything could have been in there (body parts, anyone?) and you wouldn't know until you unwrapped it. Think I'll pass!  The dark, dingy interior made me wonder - done this way on purpose, or do they just not care? Dark-haired male barista gave off the impression we were bothering him by ordering drinks... Baby, you're in the wrong job. Is this the new standard for service downtown? If so, it's nothing to be proud of.  My mocha frappé looked like it was going to be amazing. Chocolate syrup swirled prettily against the sides of the plastic cup. What I got was a funky taste in my mouth, accompanied by coffee grounds. Um, those aren't supposed to be in here! The ice melted almost immediately, and this was a frozen drink. That would be impressive under the right circumstances, but no.  Complete disappointment. Won't be back.",0
Coffee Shop 67,"2 check-ins Having just moved to Austin, I figured that my first step in the transition process needed to be finding a coffeehouse that felt cozy and chill. I'm more than sure that this great city has tons of them, but I can't think of a better first impression than the Hideout Coffeehouse.  I popped in after spotting it while walking down Congress and immediately fell in love.  The first thing that was evident was that they had a solid array of drinks.  From coffee to teas, there are plenty of options for all caffeine lovers. I settled on an iced tea since I was a little sweaty after exploring Austin.  I almost bought a sweet treat, but restrained myself...this time.    The atmosphere is relaxing and it's fun just to look at the variety of artwork on the walls.  This seemed to be enjoyable not only for me, but for the other customers that I was people watching (a bit of a hobby for me).  There were plenty of outlets on the walls for those in need to get a little work done.  I'm intrigued by the theater aspect of this place and will have to check it out next time I'm in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 67,2 check-ins Perfect place to stop for breakfast while on my way to ATXFest. Coffee was yummy. Breakfast taco was yummy. Reasonably priced and the baristas were super nice.,1
Coffee Shop 67,"Really cute coffee shop with a very hip feel. I got the dirty chai and also a poppyseed Allmond muffin. The muffin was absolutely delicious, and the dirty chai was very well-made and not sugary so you can add your own level of sweetness. They also have a very wide selection of baked goods, including gluten-free options. They additionally have Amy's ice cream so if you're in the mood for some dessert, there are options for you there as well! Most importantly, the service there was quick and very friendly! I forgot to order my try with skim milk when I put in the initial order, and when I contacted the barista later on to change it, they did it with a smile and without me making me feel like I was a huge inconvenience.  :)",1
Coffee Shop 67,We love D at The Hideout @ the Lavaca Plaza building! Always friendly and personable. She definitely brightens up our Monday!,1
Coffee Shop 67,"Stumbled across here while visiting Austin and came in not knowing what I wanted except that I wanted it in a ""fancy mug"" as I like to call it. Little did I know they were down to one coffee grinder and this lady made my coffee by hand. It was delicious and I am really appreciative of the service she gave. 5 stars for drinks and service.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I have been to this cafe several times and I must say it is a very comfortable place to hang out at. I love their brownies but I mostly like the relaxed setting. I love getting on my laptop, sip on some cocoa or coffee and at times just people watch out the window. It is small and cozy.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Hideout definitely is hidden away...or was for me, Admiral Oblivious. I first stumbled onto this place one February morn but a year ago. A friend (I'll call him He-Man) came over to my place around 6am that Sunday so that we could go cheer on our friends who were running the marathon. He-Man brought his cousin...and a box of wine.  Oh boy.  The day started out nicely enough, despite the fact that I didn't get any coffee. We drove to our first intended cheering station, where my sign was the clear winner (BE BEYONCE). He-Man ran after our friends when we saw them, and almost got hit by a slow-moving bus.  It was then that I realized He-Man and his cousin were still drunk from the night before.  We then moved on to the next station...or would have, if He-Man the navigator hadn't lapsed back into a boozy stupor. We ended up stuck at the front of a line of traffic waiting for a gap in the pain parade for an hour and a half. He-Man and cousin made water in the bushes, while I tromped straight up to one of the neighborhood houses and asked to use the bathroom like a human being and a woman who doesn't like to bare her ass for a line of traffic.  Anywhooooooo...a gap finally opened up and we sped off. As the hours wore on, I became painfully aware of my growing caffeine deprivation and subsequent headache. We ended up parking near downtown at the Mexican American Cultural Center, where He-Man emptied his stomach in front of a high school kid he used to coach. So that was great.  Having given up on the rest of our cheering stations, we made our way toward downtown. It was at the corner of Congress and 4th Street that the cousin and I turned away for a second...and when we turned back, He-Man had disappeared.  At that point, a few other people joined us, but I was the only person among the group who was concerned about my friend He-Man, who in my imagination had already fallen on a cop. The group halfheartedly searched for a couple of blocks, and then we all decided it was time to sit down.  Voila! A gorilla in the mist! Hideout Coffeehouse! How is it that I had never seen or heard of this place before? Must have something to do with the name. Tucked away in its own little corner, the place had exactly what we needed: Caffeine, beer, and a multitude of pastries. We sat near the front at tiny copper tables, which are exactly the right size for a laptop. Semi-dark interior, local art, big windows, music that doesn't deafen you, and cool baristas. A great end to a marathon of a day.  He-Man eventually found us, and so did our newly-medaled friends. So maybe it's a great place to tuck away and get some work done in a low-profile environment, but I wouldn't use it to, you know, hide from the police or anything.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Listed in Coffee Shops in Austin If you want to get work done on your laptop, go elsewhere. It took me about 10 minutes to load this page, and I'm staring at dimly lit Adventure Time-styled coffee shop art while waiting.  I can see this as a good place to meet and catch up with people, though. The dimness and louder music makes this place better for conversations. Plus the large window facing Congress makes it great for people watching. I have an entertaining view of poor souls being snatched up by the suspiciously friendly Save the Children people out on the streets. Also getting some great fashion inspiration.  There's a larger selection of pastries and snack foods than before, and the coffee is still OK. However, given the choice between here and Caffe Medici downtown, I'd choose the latter.",0
Coffee Shop 67,"Hotel dining is highway robbery, so it was worth the half-mile trek to Hideout for substantive cold brew iced coffees and perfectly satisfactory breakfast tacos. The feel is laid-back bohemian. They unpretentiously offer a whole menu of ""specialty"" sweet drinks, and there's a space in the back for stand-up comedy.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"What a gem!  Aside from Boite, this is my fave coffee shop now!  Their breakfast burritos are so tasty, and at $2 (or something else ridiculously affordable) they are a steal.  Great coffee as well.  Woman at the counter was so sweet, and patiently recommended her favourite offerings to get a taste of their café.  Very comfortable atmosphere + good coffee + Texas breakfast burrito = an odd combo that seriously works.  When in town, I will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Just stopped in for coffee after a long day, service was excellent and the drinks were delicious. Quiet place to enjoy a cappuccino Dirty chai latte Cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 67,Listed in My BEST of Austin One of my favourite coffee shops in Austin.  It's great if you are already walking around downtown but if you are driving--goodluck.  They make excellent coffee and I usually stop in this place on New Years eve.  They also sometimes sell torchy's tacos and some of the best biscotti I've had.  This place is pretty quiet and most of the crowd is a bit reclusive.  The back of the space is a theatre and they do lots of improve groups too. instax photo of the baristas soy latte and cranberry biscotti See all photos from Kelly R. for The Hideout Coffeehouse,1

Coffee Shop 67,"Very good coffee. Was looking for a mocha coffee and the specialty, Gorilla mocha was great - better than any crappy mocha coffee I've ever had at Starbucks. Friend says the Yin-Yang was also very good.",1
Coffee Shop 67,2 check-ins Much nicer than Starbucks across the street.   With some of Austin and Texas unique flavors.   Too bad all the corporate yuppies and government suit clad officials are quick to walk by without stopping to see who checked in and waiting to meet to them.,1
Coffee Shop 67,"Listed in Peepin' Austin Wonderful selection of loose leaf teas, soy milk for that heavy ass Amy's milkshake you are dying to have, and always good tunes playing while you read, talk or relax on that comfy couch by the window.  The staff is cool shit, too. Very friendly, unlike how elitist coffeehouse staff has become over the years, that has allowed for a very welcoming, comfortable place to enjoy a nice cup of hot Jamaican Rooibson or White Peony tea.  A cool theatre sits in the back of the shop where you'll find music or improv almost daily. There's a theatre upstairs, but I never made it too far from the couch by the window.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Just tried this place today...great service, comfortable yet trendy atmosphere and delicious food and coffee. I got a turkey pesto sandwich with an iced caramel latte and both were amazing. Crusty sourdough bread and fresh ingredients on the sandwich (made as soon as I ordered- not sitting in a case) and good quality coffee you can taste, not just the flavoring. Love supporting local joints over the chains. :)",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Nice place, chill, arty with a fair amount of seating. Good coffee and decent chai latte. Bakery nibbles.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"I approached the counter with Heather L. and asked the barista what I should order if I wouldn't be able to enjoy this Austin establishment for a while because my physical being would be in another state. He gave an excellent recommendation of the espresso rocket ($4.85) because a) Amy's Ice Cream is local, and b) Katz Coffee is in Houston. It was also /very/ effective at keeping me awake after dinner: like a woman on speed, I proceeded to stay up for way too many hours cleaning and working. (The barista also took the time to give me some handy advice since he turned out to have also lived where I'm planning to move to.) Heather got the Almond Joy and was correctly warned to steer clear of the special of the day (Sea Salt & Caramel Latté): the Almond Joy was so delicious.  As we sat by the window enjoying our drinks and each other's company, we noticed the interesting things on the walls and ceiling (e.g., several human head sculptures high up on the wall, a doll in a Tarzan get-up hanging from the ceiling). And a bizarre, repurposed school bus labeled ""Interstellar Communication"" and a platform with a railing on top of it drove up and down Congress outside. Yes, there was a band of some sort on the bus's platform, and some guy hanging out the bus's front door. Thanks to the Hideout's large front window, we were quite entertained.  The verdict: I'm going to miss the Hideout. It's definitely a place that is very Austin even as downtown is getting more and more Californian. Keep up the good work! The espresso rocket kept me up for more than eight hours.",1
Coffee Shop 67,Took a walking tour of Austin on Congress Avenue with the Austin app that can be downloaded from the austintexas.org website. Found this place on Yelp. Great atmosphere with a lot of seating. Place is located downtown area so does not have free parking.  I usually just get black coffee but the drink choices here were great. Got the ying yang mocha drink with white and dark chocolate - delicious! Yummy for a cold day. They also have drinks made with Amy's Ice Cream. Didn't get a chance to try them because it's so cold outside today.,1
Coffee Shop 67,"For those who don't know, the Hideout Coffeehouse is a completely separate business from the Hideout Theater upstairs.  Maybe it's just for liability reasons but it's an interesting split.  Friendly baristas knows their stuff and they'll try to accommodate any request.  I'm really just happy that they can squeeze out delicious shots of espresso to wake me up before (improv) class. Thanks hideout-coffee-guy!  The Hideout is a overlooked bastion of Austin's coffee culture.  A little bit shabby, a little bit chic, a lot of homey and a warm feeling like you're wrapped in a big coffee shop blanket.  The Coffeehouse acts as a concession stand / waiting room / lobby for the Hideout theater.  As with most coffeehouses these days, the Hideout also had a pretty good selection of beers, sandwiches, local pastries, bars, and sweets.  The only criticism I have is that their particular Guinness selection (bottle stout, no nitrogen) is probably the worst variety.  C'mon guys, serve the nitrox cans and a pint glass already!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"If I were to open a coffee shop, I would like to think it would be like The Hideout.  Coffee + Beer + Comedy + Non pretentious staff = a winner  I would have rated it 5 stars, but they don't allow you to open a tab, which is slightly inconvenient - especially if trying to grab a quick beer during a show.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Drinks - good. Staff - NOT GOOD.  We enjoyed the matcha man frappe and espresso rocket, but the baristas are uninviting, abrupt, and made me feel like I should apologize for walking in and taking up their time. Nice little cafe, good decor, but I probably wouldn't come back.",0
Coffee Shop 67,Listed in Keep Austin Weird Nice spot owned and run by women. I say this only because it's on the front door....  The ambiance is nice. The happy hour is decent and the humus plate was plentiful.  Great place to read a book or be with your thoughts.,1

Coffee Shop 67,"164 check-ins Listed in Best Central Austin Breakfasts HideOut is the Dive Bar of coffee shops.  It's a little worn, a little musty, you get some sketch characters in there sometimes; BUT it's got the best drinks, the best atmosphere, that ""welcome home"" feeling you only get from local Austin places.    DRINKS & SERVICE: Excellent I stroll in here 2-3 mornings a week.  Jackie and Michael are usually working.  They promptly get me my El Pachon (their light roast coffee) with skim milk.  If Jason D. (current check-in Duke here) is with me, Jackie only questions whether he would like a medium or large today, and then she whips up the best iced vanilla latte in town.  There's a new kid that usually works weekends who also makes a mean latte (I usually get my hot almond-flavored latte with skim when he's working).  Recently,since I'm cutting back on caffeine, I even braved the DECAF coffee.  It's got a strong chocolatey flavor and is actually really good.  Yes, that's right, the decaf coffee is good, I said that. (Though I still need one cup of my El Pachon, yum).  FOOD: Good enough Sometimes I get a scone (doesn't hold a candle to Cake and Spoon, or Waltons, but I still find myself craving them (read: sugar addict)); sometimes I get an amazing Migas and Avocado breakfast taco ala Torchy's Tacos.  (All the tacos are vegetarian.  For meat ones, go to Royal Blue next door).  The muffins and wraps are good too.  I don't really come here for the food specifically, but I still enjoy it.  DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: It's got character, definitely. I love the ever-changing artwork. The pink chairs and the long orange bench are a little gross.  And I wish  there were power strips coming out from under the orange benches so I wouldn't have to crawl under them to plug in my laptop. But it's comfortable enough for me to sit there for hours on end video editing.   This is a GREAT place to work, until around 6pm when the improv crowd starts showing up.  Man, those people are LOUD.  I wouldn't call this place quiet, but I can easily ignore (even enjoy) some music and the casual coffee house conversation.  But when it's time for improv classes to start, it's time for me to pack up my laptop. And I almost forgot, the bathrooms are clean and full of interesting graffiti that gets reset every so often.  It's an extension of the overall Hideout vibe of self-expression.  Also, FREE WIFI!!",1
Coffee Shop 67,"Listed in Austin and Dallas Faves Cute little place around the corner from the hotel I was staying at (Driskill) in downtown Austin.

Next time I'll have to try the Breakfast Taco everyone else is raving about - seemed very popular when I was there, but I'd already eaten :-(",1

Coffee Shop 67,"Last night after dinner we wanted to grab some decaf coffee and got on the inter-webs to find the Hideout Coffee House. We ordered and were sort of waiting around for our drinks and heard hysterical laughing. The place was completely dead and I asked what was going on. As it turns out it was an Inprov comedy show in an intimate space located at the back of the building. The owner heard us talking and invited us to see the show free of charge. Being a doer - I had to do, and had the best time ever. However, the show started at ten and let out at midnight. That doesn't make for an easy 5am wake up.",1
Coffee Shop 67,"The frappe tasted great. Service was terrible, so much so that it warranted a two star review. The barista taking orders was severely aloof making the ordering process unnecessarily lengthy and painful. If not for my dire need of coffee, and my urge to try a local joint (not the Sbux across the street) I would have walked out. Unfortunately, Sounds like a Sbux frappiccino would have been the better option.",0
Coffee Shop 67,"Walking down Congress, I had stumbled upon this little hidden gem. The barista was pretty friendly, and had good advice on where to go for us out of towners.

Coffee Shop 67,"I came to The Hideout on a Thursday night to see an Improv ""Threefer.""  The coffeeshop part when you enter has a familiar and comfortable vibe. The barristas were both very nice though I didn't buy anything. I went to the box office and purchased a ticket, which was only $3. I arrived at 7:45 and the show started at 8pm, so I sat in the café until it was time to go upstairs to the theatre. There also appeared to be a music stage downstairs...I didn't go to that show, but the sound quality was fantastic. They called us up- we trekked up the stairs to a small room with a stage and a cityscape set. Three different comedy troupes performed improv (much of which was based on audience suggestion).  Overall, it was a really fun way to spend the evening if you're not a big drinker but want to be around nightlife. Inside the Hideout",1
Coffee Shop 43,Coffee and dogs.  What's not to love? Came here at 8:30 on a Saturday morning. The outdoor space is great and I was the only one there that was hanging out. (Probably because everyone else was hungover and sleeping #college)  I got an iced coffee and homemade poptart. Homemade you say? Yes. Yes I do.  It was like Poptart went to college and got a job and got married. It had it's shit together. It was Apple strudel in a flakey buttery crust with cinnamon icing and crumb topping.  The iced coffee was great. Smooth and strong. Perfect with the poptart. Save yourself from Starbucks and cross the street. Hit up Lucky Lab and enjoy!,1
Coffee Shop 43,"Their truck comes to my office building a couple of afternoons a week and has been for a good while, but I just recently tried them for the first time. I absolutely love their Honey Chai, hot with nonfat milk. It is the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I could drink this everyday. The price is on average with everywhere else, they get the temp just perfect so you can sip within minutes of getting it. I've also had their rice krispy treat, it was a huge piece and really fresh tasting like it had just been cut.  I'd say I'm going to try some other drinks, but I don't know if I can break myself away from the Honey Chai! Well done y'all!",1
Coffee Shop 43,"As someone who used to get the same thing every time I got coffee, I must say I've loved trying Lucky Lab's custom syrups and concoctions. It's a fabulous treat to get a rose mocha or honey latte.  Also, they don't nickle and dime the non dairy folks--any milk is no extra charge.  But if you come for the caffeine boost, you'll return for the service and friendly baristas who remember you! You can check 'em out behind Urban Outfitters on Guad or many festivals, or utilize their catering for wedding or corporate events. #nomz 11th one's free!",1
Coffee Shop 43,"I have tried their drip coffee and everything on their wonderfully creative spring menu - their pomegranate ginger latte, orange blossom latte, chai latte and lavender rose mocha.  Everything is SO GOOD. It took me way too long to write this review and share this joy with everyone.  My favorite would definitely be the lavender rose mocha - this drink only has a slight fragrant taste that is not overbearing at all which I have experienced with many other flower-type lattes at other places.  I have not tried any of their baked goods yet but they seem delicious as well! Some of their baked goods are homemade and they also have some from Upper Crust Bakery - an amazing bakery. I am so happy they made a home in Space 24 Twenty - a convenient place to stop by on my way to class or on my way back to my apartment. I am already a regular and you should be one too!!

It's national coffee day today, and the Thai tea syrup was finally back and I finally got to have my fav drink. And Madison was here, and was super swamped near closing time, and kept apologizing (even though she didn't need to bc I get it, you're busy lol) for making me wait. All in all, Madison's awesome and I got my fav drink (finally, after coming two separate times and it being out).",1
Coffee Shop 43,"Oh, poop. I was really expecting something out of this one.  Lucky Lab Coffee Co sits in Space Twenty Four behind Urban Outfitters. The food truck is beautifully crafted--all black with wood, a glass panel to showcase their ""souvenirs"", a very well laid out menu to the right side. It all looked so nice that I really wanted to like my drink (plus, it's gotten a bunch of four and five stars so far, so I thought it MUST be good). Plus, I was so excited because it was right on the edge of campus.  I got a large iced vanilla latte, which is 20oz for $5.    And for $5, I got a drink that tasted like watered down burnt coffee. With milk. There's no other way I know how to describe it, so I was obviously disappointed in my drink, to say the least. I knew it wouldn't taste good as soon as I saw it because it missed that creamy color you usually get from mixing espresso and milk. Instead, it looked like how you would get an iced coffee or latte at Starbucks. That's not a compliment.  Maybe their regular black coffee is good or maybe I should have gotten a smaller cup... I'm hoping to come back and give it another shot. Next time, Lucky Lab. Hopefully.",0
Coffee Shop 43,"Still searching for a good cappuccino west of i35. I really hoped this was going to be my new go to coffee spot on my way to campus. Unfortunately, the espresso barely had any taste besides burned water, and the milk was steamed way beyond the normal temperature of any good cappuccino I've had.  I hate to rule this place out completely, but I think I must continue my search for a good cappuccino near campus that doesn't come from my kitchen.",0

To be fair, we do not pay them to come, the runners and festival attendees pay them individually.  They cancelled on September 15th because they received a booking for a private event. We were not able to find anyone else to replace them. This company came out to my charity event in 2014 and did a wonderful job.  Coffee and service was great. They were flexible and accommodating.

Coffee Shop 43,"This lovely little coffee shop on wheels started coming by my office park last Friday in the mornings.  I don't drink a ton of coffee, but I love to drink chai in the morning given the opportunity.  It's not really conducive for me to make a proper cup of chai at my office and microwaved water in your tea really sucks. really really sucks. I stopped by last Friday morning and had their house chai and my Friday was all the better for it.  It was so nice to drink a good cup of what tasted like properly steeped tea with just the right amount of sweetness blended with spice.  This morning it was raining and i thought..well no chai for me..but what do i see but that truck sitting out there in the rain. This morning I had the honey drizzled chai and on such a gloomy morning this really brightened the day.  My one regret was today i didn't get the awesome cinnamon chip muffin I had last week.  I ate the entire thing over the morning. it was so moist and perfectly complemented the chai I was drinking. I won't make that mistake again.  If you have the opportunity to get a drink from this mobile coffee truck don't even hesitate.  These guys have basically any milk or non-dairy product you could want in your beverage of choice and their menu appears to be pretty extensive.  I can't comment on the taste of the coffee since I haven't sampled it, but i would hazard to guess that's pretty good too..just from the aroma emanating from the truck.",1
Coffee Shop 43,Best cappuccino I have had in a long time. Delicious coffee and friendly staff with quick service. Cannot ask for more. Highly recommend this coffee trailer!!,1
Coffee Shop 14,"Cream Whiskers is definitely one of those places that receives criticisms and tagged as ""overrated,"" so I avoided trying this place for a while. However, when I finally tried it after three years, I was mad at myself for never giving it a chance before.  First, aesthetics. I was with a group of friends when we stopped by, so I recieved a chance to see and taste the variety of flavors at one go. Each cream puff contains a pastel color, that suits each flavor of whipped cream, custard or cheesecake filling. While the color of the cream is already alluring enough, the choux pastry has beautiful shades of light and dark brown that complements the filling. Each flavor also has their respective toppings. For the ""Matcha Azuki"", they added azuki red bean paste and a dulce de leche drizzle, for the ""Fresh Strawberry"", they added whipped cream, strawberries and belgium chocolate ganache, and so on. And if that isn't enough, they complete the order by sprinkling some confetti sugar on top, (for ""Tiramisu"" it was cocoa powder.)  While aesthetics and plating is important, so is taste! I ordered the ""Matcha Azuki."" I love matcha, but I'm always super sketical to order an item that contains matcha, since it's difficult to execute it correctly. I'm also a bit wary of red bean paste too. I love the taste, but it's hard for me to get over the texture when it contains a bit of the beans. So I was a little disappointed when they did have the beans in the paste (Side Note: This is just me being super picky! Most of the red bean desserts come with small pieces of the beans inside. I'm just super weird when it comes to textures and you will probably notice that in my reviews.) but I was surprised at how well the flavors all worked together! I didn't think the matcha and red bean paste pairing was unusual, since it's actually super common. What I was surprised about was the Dulce De Leche drizzle. Initially I thought it was strange, but the flavor didn't overpower the main flavors so it was an enjoyable pairing.  Eating the whole thing isn't difficult. There is a variety of flavors packed into one item, that even after the third bite, you still enjoy the taste. And yet, the flavors do not fight against another and it's not too heavy. This is super important! There are some dessert places that immediately drag you down after you finished it. However, since it is cream puffs, it's already light to begin with. But even with adding all the extra ingredients, it's still not too heavy to eat after dinner.  Definitely stop by this place if you haven't given it a try! Don't let the ""it's too overrated"" comment stop you. I know I learned my lesson to try things out before you completely trust someone's opinion. Also a bonus for UT students: This place is pretty close to the campus and it's a nice, quiet place to study. However, just like other places, the restaurant itself is small and can only contain, at most, about 30 people. So if you want to study, get there early, if you can wake up.

Coffee Shop 14,"I've been wanted to try this place 5 years ago since they were still a truck.  Finally. SO WORTH IT.  All the cream puffs are beautiful.  They don't skimp on cream or toppings. It's not overly sweet either. My bf was sick so I stayed home with him while my best friends brought it back for me... aesthetics waned a little; a little melty, but taste was... decadent and light.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"What's better than cream puffs, coffee, places to study, and a great indoor atmosphere? Cream Whiskers. 'Nuff said.  While I live just around the corner, this place is great for studying and to enjoy a light and refreshing cream puff for any evening. The atmosphere is nice with lots of pictures and great for studying because of the availability of power plugs and conveniently located in West Campus (about 3 blocks off of Guadalupe.)  Cream Puffs are the best, I definitely recommend the Mango one, it is one of my favorites! I have also had the Strawberry and the Matcha Azuki, all of them are delicious!  I haven't had much of the drinks, but if this is your first time coming, get one of their cream puffs!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"THE CREAM PUFFS GOT SMALLER T.T.T.T I would give it a five, but I just can't get over that fact. Can't let go of the past man. Also they rose the dang prices! But other than that, convenient, friendly service, and a great chill study spot! Plus interior is super cute and it's located next to CHOP (campus house of prayers): very nice, you should come! My ministry has the time slot on Mondays at 7 pm it's very nice and peaceful~ anywho! Yah I really like the strawberry, Oreo, and matcha cream puffs though, but don't really like the new cookies they added. Coffee is big and good! Overall very chill study/date/talk/qt spot that can sometimes get crowded but not bad not bad at all~ ooh also seating outdoors and street parking is free after 6pm on weekdays and free on Sundays! Puff Pastries",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Highly recommend cream whiskers! Affordable light desserts! Freshly baked handmade cream puffs are so delicious, on top of that you can choose from cookie top or original. Cookie top is a bit more flavorful, sweeter and crunchier. Go with original if you want something more traditional.  Lots of flavors: cookie n creak (too sweet). My favorites are mango, vanilla whip, strawberry cream cheese, fresh strawberry and matcha.  The shop is pretty small, space is limited but very cozy. Lots of tea choices and coffee!  Ps. They make your cream puffs in front of you, so it might take a while. Top: fresh strawberry, vanilla whip Bottom : strawberry cream cheese, match See all photos from Tiffany C. for Cream Whiskers",1
Coffee Shop 14,"2 check-ins Mind. Blown.  We decided to check this place out on a whim 'cause it looked interesting; really representative of the unique eats that Austin has to offer. The hus-bae seemed reluctant at first, but as soon as we opened their door, the gorgeous smell of freshly baked puffed pastries wafting through the air nearly had us floored. They offer their ""puffs"" in an original and cookie-top variety. I do believe the cookie-top is priced about $0.50 extra? Nonetheless, we ended up with 3 cream puffs after contemplating over all the different permutations and combinations we could have.  Mango cream puff on original: To DIE for. Excellent quality delicate puffed pastry with a delightfull tasting mango flavored cream cheese filling. The cream puff was oh so delicately sweetened with the just the right hint of tartness from the cream-cheese based filling. Topped off with a mango drizzle, this was perfection in a puff.  Brown butter pecan on original: Light and airy, the cream filling was so delicately flavored with hints of brown butter and pecans, topped off with what I believe was a brown sugar drizzle?  Fresh strawberry on cookie-top: The combination of fresh sweet strawberries and fresh cream filling is perfection. They finish this one with a chocolate drizzle. What's not to love?  I can't wait to take the next out-of-town friends that decide to visit us to this place! I love showing off the awesome eats we have access to living here in the ATX :) Mango Matcha Azuki Fresh strawberry. See all photos from Mrs. Arati S. for Cream Whiskers",1
Coffee Shop 14,"2 check-ins What an absolutely fantastic find by my wife..!! Creampuffs, she knows this is my weakness when it comes to desserts. After wonderful date night at Shabu, we were looking for something that was light but flavorful to satisfy our sweet craving.  The front entrance is tiny and so is the storefront, but as soon as my wife opened the door, the wonderful fragrance of freshly baked creampuffs filled the air.  The mango creampuff was my absolute favorite, I would definitely have that one over and over and over again.  They have a nice relaxed atmosphere in the store, something that goes with the Austin vibe.  I will definitely come back to try the other flavors and keep exploring more of the wonderful offerings this place has to offer.

Coffee Shop 14,"Listed in A Taste of Asia and the Islands, Steepin' in Green Tea, There's No Place Like Home, How Sweet It Is! Once upon a time, Eric R. drove me to Pasadena, CA for the Texas at UCLA game a month after we got married (so I definitely knew he loved me, he is an Aggie!) - anyway, I had learned about Beard Papa on Travel Channel and called over 20 locations in LA trying to find matcha flavored cream.  It happened to be in Pasadena so we went there and I suppose I was happy but not necessarily overwhelmed.  Remember 10 Things I Hate About You, ""Can you ever just be whelmed?""  I found out about Cream Whiskers in a ""100 places to eat/drink in Austin"" blog post, and here I was melting away in the Texas heat, with about 15 minutes to get to the bus stop I needed to catch a bus to make everything in my schedule work.  I got to Cream Whiskers, and the kind staff person explained what the deal is.  I ordered an original puff with matcha filling, which technically includes sweetened azuki beans, matcha cream, and a generous drizzle of dulce de leche over the top plus a dusting of powdered sugar.  She took my money, gave me the indulgence to go, and I hoofed it several blocks in my high wedges and got on the bus.  Luckily, the ingredients she used were refrigerated and held up in my heated frenzy.  I was in cream puff heaven on the bus, where I probably was not allowed to eat it.  The matcha was soooooo green-tea-grassy (in a good way) and the combination of red bean and dulce de leche with it was great.  The cream puff also held up and was not soggy.  I will be back, and there are many other flavors to try but I may just stick with matcha azuki!!!  Itadakimasu!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"4 check-ins Listed in Just A Spoonful of Sugar I love Cream Whiskers for their cute atmosphere, convenient location for UT students, and of course their cream puffs.  My favorite flavors are the matcha azuki (matcha AND red bean? Yes pls) and the mango cheesecake. I always prefer the cheesecake flavors over the regular whipped ones because it's thicker and oh so delicious.  In terms of drinks, I like their chai lattes but NOT their matcha latte. The iced matcha latte tasted super powdery, and there were even some big chunks of matcha powder floating on the top.  You can collect stars when you pay with your card, and after you've collected 10 you get a reward on your next purchase!  My complaints would be that the cream puff is kind of small, so it's gone pretty quickly unless you eat like a cat. Also, availability of outlets and seating is dismal. I would like to study here, but good luck finding a seat! Tiramisu Cream Puff",1
Coffee Shop 14,"The cream puffs here are really good and they're definitely Instagram worthy too! I actually wish I had a bigger appetite to finish my cream puffs, but it was too big for me to finish.  I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake cream puff with a cookie top! The tiramisu and cheesecake flavors complemented each other pretty well, while the cookie top gave it a nice texture to it! I liked the pirouette cookie bit that garnished the cream puff, because it made it a lot nicer to take pics of. I believe it cost about ~5-6 bucks for a cream puff, which is a little on the pricey side from what I'm used to, but it's big and filling so I guess you're getting your money's worth ^_^  I also liked the decor of the place. It's trendy and very hip!  I think it seems like a pretty good study spot as well.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"I feel so sad that this place has been open for so long and I have not even ventured over this way. Like Celine Dion song, bucket of cream puffs, and tears sort of sad.  We ordered 6 of these behemoths of the dessert world just to get a sample of all the flavors. The mango flavor ranked high up with the brown butter pecan. The strawberry looked good but my 3 year old niece defended her territory like a grizzly defending her cubs. Personally, the Matcha Azuki (Green Tea) puff was my leave favorite.  The option of the cookie crust left me inundated with too many options and I broke down like a robot. I don't know what else I'll be eating because each option has me drooling.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"The One star is for the flavors being good but everything else failed. The custard filling was not a true custard. It was more a heavy whipping cream filled puff. When we got our puffs the filling was already melting in the plate. The consistency was very very watery. In fact one of the puffs, vanilla, was basically water. It spilled all over the plate when we digged into it. Not cool not cool at all.  I was severely disappointed because I was expecting better quality for the price I paid. FYI it's $5 for each regular cream puff and they were extremely small. Chinatown can provide a better cream puff for a lot less.  It took them forever to make just two cream puffs. I know I read about the long waits but  I wasn't anticipating it to take that long. If the puffs are already baked and all you had to do was add the filling it really shouldn't take over 20 mins.  This place is a no for me for sure. Matcha cream puffs and vanilla bean puff.",0
Coffee Shop 14,"2 check-ins One of my favorite dessert places in Austin. Basically a pastry filled with cream/custard filling in a variety of different flavors, including matcha, strawberries and cream, mango and cookies and cream. My favorite has probably been the tiramisu, which I believe was a seasonal flavor and not served year round. Every cream puff I have gotten has been played beautifully. I really appreciate the attention to detail the staff has. There are also a variety of espresso and tea drinks available as well. Great place for a quick dessert near UT. Tiramisu cheesecake with a cookie top",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Very disappointed on walking in from our Hotel 5 blocks away. It is a nice morning. Hours on door and Yelp are 7a.m. Fortunately it was 8:02 since they now open at 8:00 instead. Be warned, they don't have their food available until 9. No mention of that. So we will sit here, have a cup of coffee, which they did have and decide where to go for breakfast.  Have to edit, since the manager graciously asked to nice girl helping us to offer us these cookies. BTW, just got our coffees, 15 minutes later. Glad we are the only ones here. We might still be here at 9! Then I can tell you if the cream puffs are as amazing as they look. Don't come before 9 on Sunday. This is what awaits you.",0
Coffee Shop 14,"Did you know that humans are very perceptive creatures? They say that we have 5 senses but in reality we have many more such as the sense of time, balance, and sense of unwantedness. Not only that but, did you know that most of human communication is nonverbal? Around 40-50% of communication is perceived through body language, and another 20-30% is perceived through tone. With that being said, let's start this review with the worst.  Service. The girl at the cash register speaks volumes without having to utter a single word. It'd be quite impressive if I wasn't on the receiving end of it.  Actually, it was still kind of impressive.  From her non existent ""hello"" to unenthusiastic ""What can I get for you"", the first second of meeting her had told me that she wanted me to go die in a hole somewhere. At least that's what I was picking up. I asked her what flavor of hot herbal teas she had and she lazily pointed at little display of tea's on the counter, not a word was spoken. Oh, I'm sorry if I offended you by doing EXACTLY WHAT YOUR MENU SAYS TO DO. Literally the menu says,  ""Hot Herbal teas: Ask us for our flavors!""  I guess I was supposed to read between the lines and know that your display was for the hot herbal teas and not the other iced teas or rooibos teas that you offer. Silly me.  She couldn't care less about our experience and customer service, all she wanted to do was get back to her studying as was very plain to see as she immediately turns to her laptop before I even walk away. I understand that you're working at a cafe during college for some extra cash, but maybe put a little effort into your customer service (just say hello or something)?  Food. Cream puff was meh. We came near the end of the night, and the cream puff reflected that perfectly. As if it's been sitting all day and the staleness was a bitter reminder that we were unwanted.  Drinks. The tea was ok. I got a hot mint melange herbal tea and someone else in my party got a belgian hot chocolate. The tea was extremely hot and I had to wait a while before I could even sip it, which is not a problem. However, the hot chocolate was more like a lukewarm chocolate; lukewarm like the welcoming reception you receive.  Avoid this place unless you're one of those people that loves to be abused. In which case this establishment will abuse you in",0
Coffee Shop 14,"Yum!  The light texture paired with the cookie topped crunch with the creamy filling was a great experience in my mouth. I ordered the brown butter pecan and it was lovely. A little overly sweet if I'm being completely honest, but tasty nonetheless. A lot of college students lounging around with laptops taking up the prime seats.  Smells heavenly in here. Brown butter pecan with cookie top.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"I think this was actually the first cream puff I've ever had. Although I don't have much to compare it to, I know that Cream Whiskers delighted my tastebuds for sure.  The inside of the store is somewhat small, but there were enough tables, couches, and chairs to comfortably fit the few patrons that were there when we visited. It looks a lot like a coffee shop inside. Appropriate, since they serve coffee. To order a cream puff you first choose if you want the original cream puff pastry shell, or the cookie top pastry shell. Don't be scared of the cookie shell, it's actually airy enough so that when you cut into it, your cream in the middle doesn't get smooshed all over the place. After you choose your pastry shell, you pick what kind of cream you want. There are a variety of whipped creams, cream cheese based creams, custard cream, and a frozen cream.  I went with an original shell, strawberry cream cheese cream, and requested a chocolate drizzle on top (they have drizzles too). Boyfriend got cookie top, and buttered pecan whipped cream, which came with some sort of caramel drizzle. We also got a Belgian hot chocolate to share. Everything was delicious. The whipped cream wasn't too light either, like I was concerned it would be. Strawberry Cream Cheese Cream Puff with Chocolate Drizzle Added",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Very disappointing.  We went this afternoon and ordered one creme puff with vanilla custard.  The cost was $5 + tax.  The size of the cream puff was very small for that price.   The custard was not good, very artificial vanilla flavor and far too sweet, more like pudding than custard.  The pastry was stale.    The service was ok, but not friendly or conversational.  The atmosphere was like being in a library at UT, tons of students occupying all the tables and studying.    There are many better options for Choux pastry in Austin.",0
Coffee Shop 14,This place is adorbs. Wish I had a cute cafe thing like this near my campus. Got the strawberry and cream one and it was nice and airy but not too sweet.,1
Coffee Shop 14,"Updated review 16 check-ins Cream whiskers has continued improving everything since they first opened. Their cream puffs are MUCH better now than before, and all the flavors are great! The teas continue to be good and I still love the quaint atmosphere. The only thing is, I think their coffee quality has gone down, but it's still very satisfying and better compared to some of the other coffee places.  I would say this place is a must visit for anyone who needs a place to study, catch up with friends, or fulfill their sweet tooth cravings!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"2 check-ins I LOVE Cream puffs. LOVE them. I went here because it's been long enough since I've heard about them to give them a try. I got 3 puffs. The Matcha, the strawberry and the OG.  I did not like the Matcha at all! It had red beans? green beans? I don't know what type of beans at the bottom. I did not enjoy it at all. The filling/cream was ok. It was matcha flavor but it wasn't the best.  The strawberry, I got it without chocolate drizzle b/c I'm not a big chocolate fan. It was fine. It's a whipped cream, not a custard cream so I was once again disappointed.  I'm so glad I got an original!! It's just what I wanted. It's a custard cream that's the traditional filling for cream puffs. I love that it's full of cream so almost every bit had a balance of pastry and cream. I will be back! This place is a nice place to work/study also. So pretty Special flavors.",1
Coffee Shop 14,Cream whiskers... The place with puffs and cold brew coffee that makes me want to cream my pants.,1
Coffee Shop 14,"Delicious and light matcha cream puff with a surprise red bean middle! Plus free wifi makes this a pretty good place to do some work! I also got the mango puff which unlike the matcha which is light and sweet, was a lot heavier and richer with the cream and sweetness. I would suggest sticking with matcha if you don't have a super sweet tooth",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Cool location. Great selection of options (who knew you could do so many things with a cream puff???).  Very fresh pastry and fillings. Rich but not too rich. I had an Americano and it was very good.  If I lived on or even near campus, this would be a very regular stop. A great departure from the usual dessert choices. Chips, cream, and puff.... yum!",1
Coffee Shop 14,28 check-ins Ah this place is so close to campus and to my apt that i come here just to study. The mood is set just like a coffeeshop and the interior is super pretty. My favorite is the strawberry cream puff Strawberries cream,1
Coffee Shop 14,"Holy wowsers! I saw this bakery on a yelp weekly email today and tried it out. I was blown away. I don't even like cream puffs, but did not read the description of the bakery too carefully, so there i was. I tried the fresh strawberry reluctantly, expecting cream like i've had in the past where it tastes like Kool Whip and margarine, but it was AMAZING. It was exactly like the best possible strawberry shortcake you've ever had. The cream was as if you freshly whipped heavy cream at home in your mixer.  I am a very food oriented person and an experienced home cook and baker and let me tell you, this dessert was PERFECT. And I do not say the word perfect often. Just go here. This is more of a creampufferry than a bakery. They just have these creampuffs. Regular and cookie top. Get the cookie top. Fresh strawberry",1
Coffee Shop 14,"""So I read about the place which will pipe in different flavored cream and even ice cream into a choux pastry..you know like Beard Papa.."" was the beginning of a conversation with friends as we were planning an eating session in Austin...""Wait, whaaaat??""  So of course after a day of eating off we went to Cream Whiskers.  Tiny space and packed with hangers (you know people who buy one puff and hang out for 2 hours) and an overworked employee greeted us. But all was very pleasant overall.  Ordered the macha-adzuki bean puff, affogato and ice cream filled puff.  The macha was a pleasant surprise because it really tasted strongly like macha but the adzuki was just a gentle hint of a schmear at the bottom of the pastry which really needed to be ramped up to make a difference.  The ice cream and coffee were just fine.  Overall I thought the choux pastry has started losing its crispness already, but was still a pretty good eat.    They need some new and interesting flavors (jalapeno and pineapple perhaps? jalapeno jam at the bottom of the puff with pineapple cream?? ) to jack it up a notch, but good eats. Adzuki bean with macha cream",1
Coffee Shop 14,"WOW! This place is a treat! We came in around 7PM on a Saturday, only people there enjoying their cream puffs. I had the fresh strawberry with cookie top--so delicious! My friend had brown butter pecan, he loved it. We'll be back to try all of the different flavors....as we were finishing, the place packed up to the brim. This place is worth your time!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"A place to satisfy those cream puff cravings.. enter Cream Whiskers!!  I am a big fan of cream puffs, always and forever will be! The ones I had before were from Beard Papa's and ones in Japan. But CW definitely hit the spot. We came here on a hot weekday afternoon. The place was rather quiet, but I'm sure that has a lot to do with the fact that school is out, but nonetheless CW is a cozy place to hang out/study/relax. Street parking only - well the same goes for anywhere around UT.  Now the good part - We ordered two puffs, the regular puff x matcha with azuki beans & the cookie puff x lavender vanilla and prickly pear icecream (yes, comes with two scoops of icecream!).  The two different puff shells honestly tasted very similar, but I would have to say the regular puff does it better for me. The regular puff is light and chewy, but I would have preferred it to be more fluffy. On the other hand, the cookie puff, didn't give even a slight ""crunch"" factor at all. So I would say go with the regular puff. The matcha cream paired well with the azuki beans and had just enough sweetness. While, the prickly pear icecream (get that if available) is delicious!!  Overall, great selection of cream/icecream puffs! I will definitely venture back to this place again.

Coffee Shop 14,The taste of cream puffs are top notch. They are too small though for the price. If they had tea in pot It would be better.,1
Coffee Shop 14,"Not sure if it was just tonight, but the service here was terrible!  After I ordered my vanilla custard, cookie top cream puff, the girl at the counter sat on her phone texting for about 5 minutes. She got up and I thought she was going to start working on my cream puff, but she went out and got herself a cup of water. She sat back down and starting playing on her phone again.  Then someone else ordered a mocha and she got started on that right away. While I was still waiting for the cream puff. The owner came out to talk to her, but she sat back down and was on her phone again.  Finally, after about 10 more minutes she noticed my receipt was still on the table and she came out and blamed it on the owner/manager saying that they were out of the vanilla custard (it was obvious that she did not make an attempt to alleviate this situation with me or the manager many minutes ago) and asked if I would like something else. Keep in mind, that the vanilla custard is the most expensive cream puff and the cookie top is also an additional charge.  She made my second cream puff in a matter of seconds. However, it was not a cookie top and it was burnt and very crunchy.  I am so disappointed in this service and in the cream puff I have received. I paid almost 30% more for a cream puff that was poorly made, AND I had given her a nice, big tip before this situation occurred.  I will definitely be thinking twice before coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 14,"4 check-ins Love this place! Such a quiet and intimate place to hang out or even just do homework. I think the cream puffs and the drinks here in general are all very carefully handmade, and a lot of thought goes into each one. I love their seasonal menu, and I think it's so cool that they change their menu every now and then. This is definitely one of my go to dessert places, and one that you will not find anywhere else.  I had the brownie chocolate cookie cream puff and a latte, and I think that drinking coffee with cream puffs just balances really well. I think any of their flavors for the cream puffs are all good, but I saw that a lot of people really liked the tiramisu. I think the cookie outer layer is better with its crispy and sweet texture, but I do have a sweet tooth, so it might not be for everyone. I will definitely be back for more! Fresh strawberry Chocolate whip brownie",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Cream Whiskers is the trendiest dessert cafe on campus. Not only is the location convenient (about a block away from campus, and in the dead middle of West Campus) but it is cute and comfortable, and there is plenty of seating for a small group of friends. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a large group but they do cater and you can reserve the space as well.  The fresh strawberry cream puff is by far the most popular- and for good reason. It's a vanilla whip with fresh strawberries and topped with a chocolate ganache. Get it on the cookie top (a sweeter, more crunchy version of the original puff) and you're gold.  I also recommend the lavender ice cream if you want something cold and sweet! The cheesecake flavors aren't my favorite, but I'm not big on cream cheese, and they are cream cheese based.  Cream Whiskers also has a large drink menu - the chai lattes are extremely popular. You can get anything hot or iced, and they serve amazing cold brew. I recommend the elephant vanilla iced chai latte or the hazelnut iced cold brew latte.  It's also a wonderful place to study in the afternoons - it opens at 1 pm so you can spend your afternoon catching up on work after class. And in the evenings, it's a great place for a social outing with friends - there is outside seating too for you to chill.  I definitely recommend trying this place if you're a UT student - or in Austin looking for a place to have dessert. It's unique and cute and their items are all really great (and look great for instagram, too)",1
Coffee Shop 14,2 check-ins Great little shop to grab dessert and coffee while you're studying on UT campus. I don't prefer cream puffs in general so I got the cream whisker with ice cream instead. It's a little pricey considering how small the dessert is but very delicious!,1
Coffee Shop 14,"These cream puffs are sooo good! It was my boyfriend and I's first time last night and we ordered the cookie top vanilla and chocolate custard mixed together and it was delicious. The man who was making them was so sweet. He was low on staff and they were about 30 minutes to close and he had some orders backed up. Since we weren't in any rush he saved our order for last. As an apology he made us another cream puff, this time a Nutella filled cream puff! It was amazing. Next time we go we're definitely getting the Nutella cream puff! Also the place and the vibe it gives off is super cute! Can't wait to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Great cream puffs. I will definitely be back to get some as I'm always craving really amazing pastries.  Awesome study spot as well. We came in close to closing time and there were only a few left. I would recommend if you are looking to buy a lot, to go a few hours before they close.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX I'm really impressed that Cream Whiskers has continued to improve itself. The cream puffs have always been the key selling point, but CW now validates parking in nearby Quarters Garage, has plenty of outlets, plays music at the right volume, and offers GREAT iced coffee.  There are a ton of flavors of cream puffs to choose from, so odds are you'll find at least one that you'll like (if not many). You can even customize it with a ""cookie top"", although I feel it's unnecessary - the original ""top"" is just as delicious.  This is a great place for both getting work done and catching up with a friend, but I do have two complaints: wifi is inconsistent, and the cream puffs are a bit more expensive than what I would prefer to pay. Nevertheless, us students are lucky to have a place like Cream Whiskers - it's as good as it gets in West Campus!",1
Coffee Shop 14,I don't know what this is but it's not a cream puff. Also the girl at the register is so over it that it's hard to enjoy the noncreampuff cream puff. I almost felt like I had to apologize to her after placing my order for disturbing her.,0

I went with the basic filling. I LOVE Beard Papa's, a chain that is available in larger cities, but unfortunately not in Austin.  Try Beard Papa's.  You'll never go back to Cream Whisker's.  It IS cute, and perhaps the flavored fillings are better.",0
Coffee Shop 14,"7 check-ins Listed in But first, coffee. Study spot? Hang-out spot? After-a-full-dinner-dessert spot? Cream Whiskers is your spot.  I've spent at least 50% of my undergrad in this place -- and I can't list all the great things about it, but I will try, because this place deserves a visit if you're ever around UT campus.  Puffs (from my most favorite to least): Cookies n Cream (cheesecake filled with an Oreo on top, get it, you won't regret it), Fresh Strawberry (cheesecake again, you're seeing the trend here), Strawberry (you can't go wrong with plain strawberry), Choco-whip Brownie (it's a little on the sweeter side), and Vanilla (honestly it was kind of bland).  Drinks: I'm really picky with my coffee - but this place is always a hit or miss. I've tried a variety of their flavored lattes, and I think the iced caramel one is my favorite, BUT it really depends on who the barista of the day is...  BTW, they now have ice-cream puffs?? It's worth a try, but I think I'm going to stick with the original ones.  Misc: There's a good number of metered parking spots on the side, and tons of outlets for your electronic devices, and the seating isn't that bad although it does get quite busy when school is in session.  Anyway, if you're reading this, I bet you have never been to a cream puff bakery, so do yourself a favor and go now!

Coffee Shop 14,"Pleasant little shop facing 22 1/2 street. I love how the employees hand make your cream puff as soon as your order it. There's a good amount of variety and they also have a seasonal menu every once in a while.  Each cream puff comes with the option of the regular cream puff shell or a crispier, cookie-like shell. My sister and I purchased 3 cream puffs and had the regular puff shell on them (Fresh Strawberry, Chocowhip Brownie, and Cookies & Cream). All of them were great, but a bit sweet.  Store gives off a cute coffee-shop vibe, and is also a lot more than just cream puffs. I also saw options for cheesecakes and espressos. Definitely a place to try out if you have a huge sweet tooth. 4 stars because there's no other handmade cream puff shop around for miles.",1

If you are in to really sweet desserts, this may not be the place for you  although I did not try he cookie cream puff which is supposed to be sweeter.  I thought the original had just the right amount of sweetness for my taste.  I'm not into really rich desserts.  We also got a couple of coffees with our desserts.  I really enjoyed the experience and will be back for sure. Fresh strawberry Agog ago Cookies n cream See all photos from Charles Y. for Cream Whiskers",1
Coffee Shop 14,"3 check-ins I ordered the mango puff and the elephant vanilla iced chai latte. The mango puff was actually filled with a mango custard and not with cream, which I think was more delicious. The chai latte was also served in a cute mason jar. Basically everything was very cute here, from the white ball lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling to the assortment of decorations on the wall. Parking is validated if you park in the Quarters garage, but on Sundays street parking is free. This is a great place for chit chatting and studying because of the tables and outlet plugs.

Coffee Shop 14,"Cookie top Matcha Azuka puff! A but over priced, understandable though! Cute ambiance, and parking validated! Came here on a rainy day! Matcha tasted great and cream puff was light! Red bean was also great! Cookie top Matcha Azuka puff!",1
Coffee Shop 14,Adorable place! Wish this was here when I was at UT. Ambiance is ideal for a study environment and it's close to most apartments in West Campus.    Brown sugar pecan was my fav! Fresh strawberry was good as well. The cookie top and regular puff are both good but I would get the cookie top with a lighter flavor inside to balance out the sweetness. The coffee was also good and the price is great for the sizes offered.  They have some pretty interesting flavors like mango and matcha so I'll be back to try these next time I'm in Austin! Hope they expand!,1
Coffee Shop 14,"The pictures of the delicious cream puffs will draw you in alone. At least it did for me! A small coffee shop serving puff pastries filled with, my favorite, whipped cream. It's a small and quaint little place. Lots of students studying with their laptops and study groups. Couple of guys on the couch playing games. Plenty of counter space near the window to sit. We stopped by and got some coffee. Delicious. Got 2 different cream puffs. Birthday cake and fresh strawberry. Definitely wanted more but resisted. I will definitely be back to try the cookie topped puff. This is a must stop by place if in Austin for a nice treat. Birthday cake Fresh strawberry See all photos from Isabel P. for Cream Whiskers",1
Coffee Shop 14,"5 check-ins I think I have a problem, since I rate bakeries and coffee shops relatively highly compared to other restaurants. It just so happens that Cream Whiskers is a cream puff bakery AND a coffee shop. Brace yourself for ridiculous amounts of praise.  First off, the cream puffs are delicious. Are they worth the $3-5? Probably not, but #TreatYoSelf, haha. I think Mango might be my favorite, but I also love and recommend Cookies & Cream, Tiramisu, and Fresh Strawberry. Next time I go, I'm definitely trying the ice cream kind; will update this when I do!  The coffee is good enough in my opinion. I'm sure it's not professional coffee roaster quality, but I like it more than Starbucks and anywhere else close to campus. I think it's a lighter blend, but don't quote me on that. My friend had the tea, and he said it was a little watered down, so I guess I wouldn't recommend that.  The study environment is the best part. There is an abundance of outlets--I only wish there was more space! Service is always friendly, even though it's mostly student run.  Will be back to study for the rest of the semester!

Coffee Shop 14,"I've been dying to try Cream Whiskers. I'm totally not a ""dessert person"" but this particular treat struck my fancy. We arrived just before close and though they were out of ice cream puffs, they still had matcha, tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake and brown butter pecan.  I chose the latter and my two friends got strawberry cheescake. For those of you who have tried frozen creampuffs, those are not these. These are hollowed out cupcake looking things that they squeeze fresh cream-based fillings in. And you can get a cookie version. And they dribble stuff on it and add a little cute garnish.  Next time I'll try a smaller one and maybe do the ice cream thing. I wanted mine to have a bit more of a savory bite to it for balance but overall, this is one of the most unique desserts in the city right now.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"I've been here with my husband, and relaxed with friends and family as well. PLEASE trust me on this, you want to visit.  If you're on the line let me push you over into a visit. It's absolutely delicious!",1

Coffee Shop 14,"The most delicious cream puffs. Fabulous fresh filled desserts. Great place for a quick treat. We tried the tiramisu, green tea matcha red bean, chocolate brownie and brown butter pecan. Chocolate brownie Brown butter pecan Tiramisu See all photos from LItennis M. for Cream Whiskers",1
Coffee Shop 14,Got fresh strawberry with original puff. Cookie puff is a crunchier top. So yummy! The cream puffs are freshly filled when you order so no soggy puffs! Fresh strawberry has the chocolate drizzle!,1
Coffee Shop 14,"So I stopped by here earlier this evening and ordered an iced latte and a green tea azuki bean cream puff to go before I headed back home, which is an hour away. I was super excited to try this place after seeing all the positive reviews and the pretty pictures on yelp, but unfortunately I didn't get to eat mine. When I got home, I opened my little to go container that held my beautifully decorated cream puff and dug my fork right down the middle, there in between all the puff and cream was a LONG, BLACK HAIR! blehhhh. I have blonde hair so I know it's not mine, and the girl that was working in the shop tonight that was making the cream puffs did have long black hair. Needless to say, it went straight into the trash. I know the struggles of long hair and shedding, but if you are going to be working that closely with food there should be some degree of precaution. Hair nets aren't fashionable, but they work. Or make sure to pull your hair back well and wear a cap. I know accidents happen, but you should be more careful to make sure you don't serve a cream puff with a very hard to miss hair in it...  As far as the coffee goes, nothing special. It was bland and the coffee itself didn't have much going on for it. Didn't really have a good roast or aroma and no distinctive flavor note. I've had gas station coffees that tasted better.  Unfortunately I can't review the cream puff itself  because I didn't get to eat mine... Hair in my cream puff... gross Was excited about this, but then I found a hair in it.... into the trash it goes.",0
Coffee Shop 14,"ROTD With a name like Cream Whiskers, I wasn't sure what to expect.  When I walked in, I realized it was very much like the little East Asian coffee/pastry shops I used to go to in Korea and Japan: very cute, very relaxing, & with high quality treats - specifically cream puffs!  You want matcha azuki cream? They got it. You want butter pecan cream? They got it. You want 4 different kinds of chai? They got that too.  The only negative is that they don't open until 1 pm on weekdays (11am weekends). No Monday morning cream puffs for you. :( But they do stay open until 11 at night, so when you've got that late night craving, you're covered. Matcha azuki cream puff and tiger chai",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Cream Whiskers is a woman's paradise. Not saying that men don't go to this establishment (I have seen a few), but with its decor, cute cream puffs, and soft color palette, the ladies are bound to flock to Cream Whiskers.  They feature fluffy cream puffs filled with varying flavors of custard or cream. All the flavors I've tried are amazing, but my go-to is the brown butter pecan. Their drinks are superb. I love their matcha tea, chai tea... basically all their teas.  My only qualm is their hours. I wish they opened before lunch, especially since they serve coffee. Plus, it gets crazy crowded during the school year after 2-3pm that sometimes I can't find a seat. I would totally come to campus to work more often if they opened earlier! Hint hint.  Don't miss out!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"2 check-ins Listed in Sweet Tooth Satisfaction I have one word to describe this place: OMG!  I discovered this place during a recent tour of West Campus and came upon it after needing a sweet-fix post-coffee. How has this place not taken over Austin!?!  It's cream puffs, but like ""say what!?!"" cream puff flavors and you can even get a cookie top on said cream puff!?!?! I cannot stress enough that everything as in EVERYTHING Is an insta-""GET IN MY MOUTH"" situation!  It was sophie's choice (otherwise I would have instantly put on 100lbs if I had ordered everything I wanted), but I went with the Matcha Azuki sub chocolate drizzle because it seemed like the most unique flavor. It really was incredible, especially with the cookie top! Seriously, it was amazing!!! I paired it with a green tea chai (which was INCREDIBLE) and I was one happy woman!  You can definitely tell the quality of the ingredients used (especially in the chai), so I didn't mind that both my cream puff and my chai came to $8 because it was not only satisfying, fulfilling, and delicious, but everything about the experience was worth the price tag!  Can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu (one visit at a time)! The menu Matcha Azuki cookie top w/cookie top sub belgian dark choc ganache The madagasgar bourbon vanilla cookie top!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"The Matcha Tea puff was fantastic!!! I definitely recommend the cookie top. But the other two cream puffs we tried (chocolate and cookies and cream) were just okay. The cookies and cream was way too sweet and the chocolate was pretty bland. Otherwise, it's a really fun dessert choice and I will probably be back if I'm ever in the neighborhood!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"I had the regular crust with the whip cream and fresh strawberries. Yum. Tasted like a strawberry short cake, the chocolate drizzle on top was a great additional. I also bought a tee shirt hehe, it's a cream puff with the word ""hello"" inside for $15. It was a pretty expresso colored shirt so I was like why not! My friend enjoyed her butter pecan flavored cream puff but it was a bit too sweet for her. I had one of their horizon organic milk to accommodate my puff. The place itself is very cute, very good for studying but we took ours Togo for mount bonell! Yum! Yeah I bought a tee",1
Coffee Shop 14,Cute cafe! I really like the interior design of the place. There are coffee and tea to choose from and lots of different flavor cream puffs. My favorite is the Vanilla whip. It's very light and not so sweet so you don't feel guilty eating 2 or 3 of these yummy pastries.,1
Coffee Shop 14,"While on a super rare break from my gluten free diet, I came here with the hubby for a dessert. I got a cookie top puff with whipped cream and strawberries. Small, simple, tasty- not overly sweet.  Not sure super this is my kind of dessert, but I appreciated all the different flavors and combos. If I come again will try with ice cream.  The shop is super cute, quiet, with lovely decor and some games to play while you wait.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Listed in Austin Fun! This seemed like an interesting concept so we stopped in. So glad we did! A cute little place, and very friendly service. We got a cookies and cream original puff and a Choco-whip brownie cookie top puff. They were each excellent! Just the right size to not overstuff you.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Cute place with tasty treats! I went today and got the chocolate brownie cream puff, which was super tasty. Although it was pretty expensive ($3.50 for a small cream puff). The inside smelled pretty funky, and parking is only 15 minutes if you don't want to pay, but otherwise cute place! Chocolate Brownie Cream Puff",1
Coffee Shop 14,"2 check-ins I'm proud to say that I've tried every single flavor at Cream Whiskers!! This place is just too cute to resist not buying something every time I pass by it. My two favorite flavors are the Matcha Azuki and Strawberry Cheesecake! I don't think there's much of a difference between the original top and the cookie top cream puffs except cookie tops are slightly crunchier, so you can save your $0.50.  I also got the iced green tea latte. The drink tastes like creamy green tea. If there's espresso in it (which I assume so, because it's a ""latte""), I couldn't taste it. But it's still super good! Great choice for tea lovers who want a latte experience.  They tend to run out of more popular flavors (such as mango cheesecake) throughout the day, so go earlier if you want the complete menu! The only reason Cream Whiskers doesn't get 5 stars is because the cream puffs are honestly too expensive (around $3 to $4 each).",1
Coffee Shop 14,"I went with my husband thinking it would be a nice comfy place to have a cream puff and some coffee (or drinks of the sort). We walked in and found three people behind the counter and only one person doing all of the work. With that said, she was very flustered with the orders and the puffs/drinks showed it. The cream puffs had a very small amount of very watery cream and were hard. The worse part, though, were the drinks. I order a mocha, which she put in as a ""Black Coffee"" order. I made sure I went to let her know about my drink and her response was ""Yeah, they are the same price so it doesn't matter."" My husband ordered a tea, which they were ALL OUT of. The girl did offer us something instead of the tea and we ordered a hot chocolate. When the order was ready, there was a cup of tea (that was half full), a hot chocolate, and a black coffee. My husband proceeded to tell her that mine was a mocha, to which she rudely turned around and simply put a pump of syrup. The drinks were so watery, and had no flavor WHATSOEVER! I was very disappointed with the drinks, the puffs, and most of all the service. Very disappointed with the ""hot chocolate"" EXTREMELY watery!",0
Coffee Shop 14,"7 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffee My favorite flavors are the fresh strawberry and matcha azuki! Definitely try the matcha azuki if you like green tea and red bean! I really like how soft and not overly sweet the red bean filling is.  Aside from the cream puffs, their selection of teas are also really good too. I've tried the iced ginger peach black tea and iced sunburst green tea, both of which I liked. Next time I want to pair my cream puff with a latte!  I think Cream Whiskers is a nice quiet little place to hang out with friends or even study because there are plenty of tables inside and outside. Definitely worthy trying out at least once when you want something sweet and close to campus! Matcha Azuki cream puff! If you like green tea and red bean, definitely give it a try :)",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Delicious cream puffs! I never liked cream puffs before. The brown butter pecan puff is great! Coffee is pretty good. Nice atmosphere, a quaint place for college students to study.  Easy street parking. $1 = 1hr",1
Coffee Shop 14,"3 check-ins Pretty good location in the heart of west campus right behind pluckers. The atmosphere is really chill and not that loud so its a good place to study.  The cream puffs are pretty good! I'd recommend the cookie top, strawberry cheese cake.  They use fresh fruit and the creme isn't too heavy or too sweet.",1
Coffee Shop 14,The cream whiskers were pretty good. The only thing I didn't like about the whisker I got was that it was a little too sweet in my opinion. I love sweets but I think this dessert was a tad bit too sweet.,1
Coffee Shop 14,"The cream puffs were pretty good, not absolutely amazing, but they satisfied the craving. The atmosphere of the café is mellow, with students usually studying at the tables. Cute decor and open late ~ 11pm. Cookies & cream puff, mango cream puff ~ $10",1

Coffee Shop 14,"Second time here. I decided to step out of my comfort zone with Cream Whiskers. Rather than getting m all time favorite, Vanilla Elephant chai tea, I got their mocha. I wasn't too ecstatic about their mocha unfortunately. But that's okay!  As for the puffs, I stuck with the usual and got their Strawberries and Cream. Hands down my all time favorite puff from them. It's just so fresh (their strawberries) and sweet without too much added onto it. Strawberries and creme",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Have a regular shell instead of a cookie one, too sweet to me and my friends but a regular shell with matcha cream is reaally good.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Rule #1, regular top is more delicious than cookie top. Rule #2, ice cream puff tastes better than normal cream puff. Rule #3, don't get elephant vanilla shot. It is way too strong. I love how the cafe serves its iced drinks in a mason jar. That's really cute.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Listed in Ah Suga Suga! What?!?! A spot specifically JUST for cream puffs?! I had to stop by when I was in town!! We ordered the Matcha Azuki and the Brown Sugar Pecan cream puff -- WOW! The puff itself was big, light and fluffy and both fillings were not too sweet which was just perfect!! What a great dessert to have at the end the night!! We'll defnitely have to come back and try the cookie top!! Brown Butter Pecan Matcha Azuki",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Little heaven! I love this place! Delicious puffs and amazing fillings, which can be made of cream cheese or ice cream. Ice cream flavours are new and fresh (try prickly pear or summer peach, both pair up nicely with lavender vanilla). The puffs come as standard or with cookie top (the top is covers with cookie dough before baking, amazing!) The also have one option - custard filling - it's gorgeous! I also tried their new flavour - tiramisu cheesecake - my new fave! Summer peach & lavender vanilla and prickly pear and lavender vanilla! Tiramisu cheesecake Tiramisu cheesecake - heaven!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"I'm a fan, but the price for these little guys did turn me off a bit. Each one I tried was delicious -- quality cream puff, no arguments there. Just wish they were either a bit bigger or cheaper.  Original Vanilla is a must. The pastry and filling were yummy.  Cookie(topped) Mango was also delicious. The cream cheese filling wasn't overly sweet and the mango drizzle was a nice touch.  Beware of price for this little sucker!  Original Choco-Whip Brownie was my fave. The whipped cream filling was heaven.  If you love cream puffs and are willing to spend a few bucks on a yummy puff, check them out as you won't be disappointed. Cookie Mango Original Vanilla",1

Coffee Shop 14,"If you're one of those people who gets cream puffs from the frozen section, then you need to STOP THAT and check this place out because its culinary creations will BLOW YOUR MIND. If you're of those people who doesn't really get cream puffs then STOP THAT and check this place out! Whether you've got a sweet tooth or need a chill spot to meet with friends, Cream Whiskers is the definitely THE place to go. This sweet joint is great especially for UT students due to its convenient location right around the corner of campus. Cream Whiskers has really changed the game for cream puff desserts. They offer a cool variety of options from simple flavors like strawberry to unique flavors like matcha azuki. In addition, they give you a chance to go crazy with a cookie top or be a normal person and get a regular cream puff shell. I personally am I fan of ordering on the simpler side and went with the strawberry cream puff but with a cookie top. The presentation was graceful with an artistic chocolate drizzle and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. The best part however was the taste and texture. The crunchy cookie top complemented the smooth and fluffy cream with  strawberries that was sandwiched in between the cookie shell. Adding in real strawberry bits added a tartness to the sweet and fluffy cream from becoming overpowering. Overall, it was a decadent and divine experience as a first timer. It was also good to have a nice long chat with a friend in such a hip and cozy atmosphere. If you haven't already, be sure to check this place out.",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em With a name called Cream Whiskers, it is hard to not picture an adorable kitten getting her face all covered in sweet milk, then looking up at you and mewling. If this cafe was an animal, that would be it.  AMBIENCE It's so cute! It's so cozy! Wooden tables and scrapbook-looking posters on the walls. Decals. Pastel-colored decor against the wood contribute to the cheerful happy atmosphere.  FOOD Cream puffs come in two selections: original puff and ""cookie top,"" which is a puff baked with an extra sugar crust for an added sweetness/texture factor. I opted for a fresh strawberry original, and it was so cute!  Taste-wise it was a typical yummy cream puff, so nothing extraordinary but pleasant all the same. Plus points for plating.  My friends got the matcha/azuki combo and I have to say that I think theirs had a little more originality factor. The red bean tied it all together!  All in all, worth a stop if you're nearby the UT campus. Check it out during an off hour because I feel like it'd be pretty busy as a good study spot!",1
Coffee Shop 14,"Updated review 2 check-ins Listed in after eats Always a fan of Cream Whiskers--they updated their inventory and now offer dine-in mugs and mason jars for your iced drinks! What a great way to step up their game. Also when I went, their puffs were the PERFECT texture--crispy on the outside and soft inside.

Coffee Shop 42,"2 check-ins Staff is usually friendly, coffee is good. It's connected to the Grove wine bar & restaurant next door. There are tables & 1 couch or recliner type chair inside, and a few tables outside on the front covered patio. You can order food from he restaurant here too I believe. They have some pastries. This is 1 of the few places where I prefer their drip coffee over their Americanos.  There aren't many options around for coffee, so this is awesome that they're here. Parking can be a pain. It's a small lot and you're sharing it with the whole strip mall.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, Lola has you covered.  This place shares space with The Grove right next door and man, when they come together, delicious things await.  Breakfast: Lola opens severely early. The croissants (my breakfast favorite) are huge and fluffy and crispy and perfect. ICED CHAI TEA LATTE IS A MUST.  Lunch: Pizza lunch special - One OR TWO pieces of their speciality pizzas AND a side salad. It's the lunch combo created for me.  Dinner: I've gathered at The Grove for a couple of after-work socials, and the back table is great for a large group, and the calamari is wonderful to share. Wine glasses and flights, and bartenders will keep it real with you on what's good and what's worth passing up.  Great atmosphere and wonderful service.

I'm never going to Starbucks again!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"3 check-ins One of the best and most memorable coffee spots I've been to! This location has very friendly baristas and servers and they know their menu really well and have been able to suggest very good drinks for me, a coffee lover, my uncle who wanted a sweetened latte, and my little cousins who just wanted a sweet treat. The ""Chai Me a River"" is the one drink we've ordered time and again for the kids and adults alike especially in this warm and humid weather. It's sweet, not too rich, not very strongly tea flavored, and gets bonus points for not calling it a ""chai tea"" (THAT BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO TEA TEA!!) Another good drink for the kids - either the hot chocolate or Mexican hot chocolate spending on how experimentative they are. Neither are too sickly sweet! Now my favorite is the Frenchie - it's a simple espresso drink with lavender syrup and lavender honey and it's is hands down the best coffee I've ever had! It was very fragrant and flavorful notes without compromising the strong Java flavor. And also the cortada deserves a special mention for being a well made strong and flavorful pick me up drink! The Chai me a river to the lefr All their wonderful syrups! The Frenchie is my favorite See all photos from Pranati R. for Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge",1

And the coffee?   Also great.   Smooth flavors and exceptionally well prepared.  And not in small, diner-size coffee cups but in real, full-size coffee cups.    And fantastic service.  The folks there were very pleasant.   Turns out we stayed well past closing time because we were talking so much and didn't pay attention at all.  The staff there didn't chase us off at all.

Coffee Shop 42,"Out of the 45+ coffee houses that I have been to across Texas, this one easily slides into my first choice. Lola is the kind of place that has something for everyone to do. There's board games for kids (or those who are kids at heart), a wine bar- featuring both  great wine and beer options, great food from their partnering restaurant that's connected, and of course-- incredible coffee. I have been there over a dozen times and am almost always beyond satisfied with the service (incredibly friendly staff), and the creative drinks that they make (recently tried a cubano Nutella mocha that was absolutely delightful!) My go-to drink when I go is a cubano vanilla cappuccino and the chicken parm pizza is finger-lickin' good. If you love great coffee, food, and a lively atmosphere, this is the place for you!!

Coffee Shop 42,"7 check-ins Lola Savannah coffee & wine lounge manages to maintain a relaxed atmosphere even with the upscale modern interior design.  I personally love the touch of the coffee bean bags hanging from the ceiling. The coffee beans are roasted and shipped from Lola Savannah coffee company out of Houston, TX.  The staff here I found to be friendly, informative, super helpful, and pride themselves in quality coffee and coffee art.  I got to check out their skills with other patrons drinks, but missed out on an artistic cup as I opted to try some of their lovely cold brew.  The WiFi connection was good as well.  They have a nice selection of baked goods, and are one of the few places in town to offer a good variety of tasty gluten free goodies (even unwrapped!!).  The majority of their gluten free items are sourced from Blackbird Bakery who also makes the YUMMMMMY burger buns for King & Country.  I have not had one bad thing yet from Blackbird, it's easy to imagine that your eating the real thing.    They serve up some breakfast tacos in the AM which I haven't yet had a chance to try, but I hear are good, they also have a limited menu featuring items from the next door sister restaurant, ""Grove"".  I will definitely be coming here on bad weather Sunday's to enjoy some Java and food while tinkering around on my Surface.

Coffee Shop 42,"I have been here three times within the last 2weeks. And while I have had good experiences in the past here, there has been an ongoing pattern of the grove taking over LS to accommodate for their dinner crowd. The last two times there has been an 8x11 sheet of paper welcoming guests to come in and get coffee. But the place itself is reserved for dinner guests at the grove. There is a 7/11 next door that offers this service. This time, I came in and it wasn't until I got to the table that I noticed a tabletopper that was placed on each vacant table stating ""reserved for grove guests"".  If this is your intention of maximizing space, please close Lola and just expand the grove. I will be happy skip turning into your parking lot intending to study only to find out you've deemed that the service your business intends to offer is not worth it. I am not writing this out of rage, I am not ranting. This is the first 1 star rating I've ever given. And it is because it is reserved for the worst service. This is not about some underpaid employee not able to hide her frustration with her job, not about bad food, this is about a business owner unable to appropriately market and underestimate the lifetime value of a customer base.",0

You'll be asked to sit at the corner on the restroom entrance and will not be taking seriously because you are it ordering a rap from their main restaurant ""The Grove"".

Good decorations, specially the ceiling -- one star for that.",0
Coffee Shop 42,"Cool staff and easy parking on a weekday morning. There was lots of seating and a plentiful condiment counter (cinnamon, cream, milk, honey, etc).

Coffee Shop 42,"This is one of my favorite places for coffee and breakfast! For coffee: I have tried a couple different types of things on their menu and even had some of their teas and I have liked everything. It is such an easy place to stop by in the morning before work, and its miles better than starbucks. For breakfast: I love their breakfast tacos, they are by far the best in the bee cave/lakeway area, in my opinion.

If I wasn't always in a hurry I would love this place even more (is that possible?) because of their fabulous view, it amazing!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Hey-o!  Love this little place. I've met some of my students over here for advising appointments, and they've hit the mark each time (the students and the folks at Lola!).  I haven't had any of their food items yet, but they have plenty of Pellegrino and lots of espresso, so I'm a happy camper. Need a cappuccino but don't want lactose? They've got you covered with soy, almond, and coconut milks.  Lots of seating space, fast wifi, and friendly folks. The parking blows, but I guess you can't have everything.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"While waiting for my phone to be repaired a few doors away, I stopped at Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge and Wine Bar. What a lovely place!

What could be better than to be in a place with such a cool vibe and great music! If I lived in Austin, I would be here often!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"I came here with my father and my 8 month old daughter. We ordered 2 coffees and a muffin. We then fed my EIGHT MONTH OLD food we had brought for her. The gentleman and lady behind the counter then told me I could not give her any outside food. The reason given: it's a law. Really, Lola's? Why is it that the other 12 restaurants I've served her separate food in on this trip didn't seem concerned about this law? I normally only write positive reviews (see my others), but when you mess with my baby, my inner tigress comes out in full force. They suggested I feed my daughter eggs (not allowed until over a year) and foods with honey in them (ever heard of botulism?). I decided to nurse my baby to keep her happy (hungry baby doesn't make for a relaxing experience for anyone), and the man behind the counter gave me the stank eye the whole time. I also broke down and bought her plain yogurt there which she didn't like or eat since they couldn't accommodate making her any egg or honey free options. Bottom line, if you have  young children and value them being happy, this may not be the place for you.  * I must say that the manager, Katy, was not present at the time. We waited for her to arrive and when I shared my concern, she seemed genuinely surprised and relatively apologetic (despite a few comments about her needing to ""back her staff""). For this mama, it was still too little, too late.",0

Coffee Shop 42,"This place is great. It has a more upscale cafe feel to it. I've honestly gotten used to the Austin feel of cafe's with the beat up tables that were probably found in a salvage yard to go along with the staple baristas serving all the drinks.  Those places are great and dandy but this place makes me feel a little more refined again.  It's connected to the Grove Wine Bar and Restaurant next door so if you get hungry, boom you can order from the cafe, which is pretty sweet.  Legit snacks and meals there.  Their americano is smooth as heck.  I'd come back for that.  The place is a little dark if you want to study but it's fairly quiet for the most part.  You can still see just hopefully you don't have to do too much tiny print reading.  So come to chill, eat or study.  It's a nice little discovery in the nicer part of town.  Also they have ESPN on the TV if you need some distractions.  I'll be back again.",1
Coffee Shop 42,Gotta give another five star review.  Terrific ambience.  One of the best lattes in recent months. Barista was efficient and pleasant. Will return.,1
Coffee Shop 42,"To be honest, I don't properly appreciate high maintenance or complex coffee so I can't comment intelligently on the life changing experience from a mildly precocious Peruvian fair-trade organic slow-roasted Chanchamayo Valley beans pressed with triple distilled Artesian spring sourced water that you can probably get at Lola Savannah. I guess that's what I get for growing up on Dunkin Doughnuts coffee regular. :) That said, I did have a good cup of coffee there, the atmosphere was pleasant, the food smelled great, and there was a lot of activity, so they are doing a lot of things right. Another great thing about this location is that they participate in Ground to Ground and provide their used grounds/filters to area gardeners for free. Any diversion from the landfill is good and I applaud them for putting the effort forth to run an ecologically responsible business.",1

Told to leave as external food is not allowed so my daughter and I ate outside while my wife ate inside with her coffee and breakfast taco. This place might have good coffee but they could do a better job by putting a sign before entering that external food is not allowed.  UPDATE: received a polite message from one of the baristas. Apparently this is a known custom not to bring food into a coffee shop. Wife enjoyed her coffee and taco.,1

Coffee Shop 42,"Lola Savannah's got me licking my lips more than LL Cool J in the 90's!!  This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Austin!  It's not really in the city, but it's worth the extra five minutes for a very comfortable cup of your favorite coffee.  First and foremost, they've got some of the best espresso machines you can buy.   They look like they came from Metropolis.  They're coffee beans are roasted outside of Houston at the original Lola Savannah (which I believe is the owner's mother's place).  The baristas care about coffee and making it correctly which seems to be a fabled myth in the corporate coffee world we are surrounded by.  They're always playin' good music, the seating is spacious and very comfy and they have really good breakfast tacos and pastries.  Oh, and they're connected to The Grove so you can enjoy that great wine selection.  Serious recommendation from a fairly serious Yelper.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Great little spot that is a refreshing alternative to the mega coffee houses. The staff was very knowledgeable, professional and the pastry was good. What bumps this place up to 5 stars for me is they know how to properly brew coffee. I always order a single espresso when I try new places because that's the only way to actually taste the raw product. Their espresso had a beautiful crema on top, was rich with a bite, yet smooth and not bitter. The coffee is well roasted and high quality, but more importantly, the baristas know what to do with it.  Additionally, I enjoy sitting in a cafe and watching the clientele. This place seemed to pull the normal crowd. The staff is very eclectic and easy on the eyes. A mix of urbanites that are hip as well as intellectual.  Overall a great first venture that has made a mark for me. I will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Every Saturday lunch I eat at the Grove and several times have stopped at Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge. They have great coffee and friendly staff.  However today I was notified that if I wanted to put a little soy in my coffee that it would be a 50 cent up charge. And to clarify not the normal up charge you pay to make your regular latte a soy latte. I was going to be charged 50 cents to put two tablespoons of soy milk in my regular house coffee. In a world of cell phone fees and cable fees and airline baggage fees I'm now going to be charged a coffee creamer fee. I assume we are but a few years away from a sugar packet fee.  If your looking for a great cup of coffee from a place that responds to your concern with ""Well we charge for that in Westlake"" then Lola is for you.",0
Coffee Shop 42,"I was in a bad mood.  Very stressed.  Needed to get away and take a break but the idea of sitting in a Starbucks at 8:30PM sounded depressingly loser-ish.  Figured that Lola Savannah would still be sad but at least a little cooler.  Forgot that they have wine :)  Good wine :)  Let's see, it pretends to be a coffee bar but actually I can hide in the back and have wine and do work on my computer.  HEAVEN!  This is the perfect spot.  I can start with coffee and end with wine or vice versa.  I can just come here and veg out.  Great atmosphere, friendly wait staff, good wine list, food from The Grove.  Perfection!  Now if they could just fix the parking....",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Had the hot chocolate today. Um... AMAZING. Also the people who work there are super cute and friendly.

I've also had their espresso and it's equally as delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"5 check-ins Lola Savannah is the side coffee/wine lounge off of (and connected to) The Grove on Bee Caves.  I'd stopped by to put in some wifi time on my way home.    I started liking Lola a lot last night - it's low-key, somewhat upscale in an easy metro kind of way, laptop power plugs everywhere, and they were playing Radiohead in the background.  I * thought * I was checking out with my latte ticket and the next thing I knew I was sharing an enormous cheese/fruit/nut plate, tasting wines and talking about dogs, moms, and relationships with a stranger.

I've been to Lola Savannah in the late afternoon, and right when I sat down, they started rearranging the tables around me to serve people who had come in for dinner at the Grove! (the Grove and Lola are joint owned) It was a logistical mess. I can't imagine that the diners wanted to be seated in a coffee shop either.",0

Seriously, that's A LOT of love!  This place has a really great contemporary decor - it's quite beautiful to look at.  However, it's not stuffy at all - totally casual.  In the mornings, they get pretty busy with morning coffee runs, and depending on how busy the grove is - they can get crowded as a holding area at night for dinner.  During the middle of the day, it's a complete OASIS.  Celebrated my birthday with a medium sized group of friends here last year - it was perfect.  Stopped in yesterday for a cappuccino and cinnamon roll...I was one of like 5 customers.  Had a delightful conversation with Rachael after she made my coffee - she remembered me from when I worked down the way.  Left feeling cheerful, invigorated, and well with the world.  Oh yeah, all that and free WIFI.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"4 check-ins Last month, a friend of mine was visiting Austin for an assortment of interviews during an exploratory mission for moving to Austin. For the next four days, our dialogue went pretty much like this:  Her: ...It's called an engineered strategy, and small cap and value are big focus areas for them...So, they...Nathan, are you listening?  Me: So what if Kate Middleton gets her hair blown out three times a week? Big f**king deal; you do, and there's no headline anywhere about *that*.  Her: Um...are we having the same conversation?  Me: Where are we going for lunch?  One of her more intense interviews was to take place out in Westlake, so while she was supposed to go talk shop about mutual funds and her preferred philosophy about investing rich people's money, she tasked me with the MUCH more arduous job of beginning ""50 Shades of Grey"", to be read at whatever coffee shop that was close by in which I would be waiting. Lola Savannah ended up being that fateful locale.  It's less of a coffee shop as it is an extension of The Grove Wine Bar, mostly because the two spaces are separated (maybe?) by a curtain, and the employees drifted in an out quite freely between the two. I wasn't really paying that much attention, as I was on a mission.  The place is quite spacious. It's sunny thanks to the big front windows, and while there are tables and padded wall seating for plenty of people, it never felt crowded. I parked myself at a spot along the back wall with an A/C outlet, and ordered an iced hibiscus tea.  While I would have much preferred to read ""50 Shades of Grey"" in a discrete manner such as on a Kindle, or my iPad, my friend insisted on giving me a hard copy so that I could be seen with it. To be fair, my shame did not stem from the graphic sexual content contained in the novel at all, but from what I already had heard through the grapevine was undoubtedly a horrible, shit-tastic writing job. In short, I'd rather have people in a coffee house know I was reading porn than terrible Twilight fan-fiction. In this case, it was both.  First off, the hibiscus tea was amazingly refreshing, as the perky barista had already informed me during my ordering process. I sipped on that while I flipped through my iPad edition of the latest Vanity Fair in an effort to vamp before I actually started the book. Once I'd fallen in love with a Gucci tote and read more about President Obama's romantic life in NYC than I ever cared to know about, I figured it was time to bite the bullet.  The next two hours were spent with me reading a book I felt could have been pilfered from the Trapper Keeper of a freshman highschooler who knew way too much--and yet nothing at all--about sex for her age. I'm not sure if the other patrons noticed, but my facial expressions were probably priceless, sitting there with my hibiscus tea and wondering what on God's green Earth I was reading. Who the hell says ""I was a quivering mass of female hormones""? How many times could a guy say ""Laters, baby"", without having someone kick the living shit out of him for being such a douche? In what world are there 25-year old billionaires wooing clumsy, flaky girls with Audis and helicopter rides, all while handcuffing them and whipping them in a Seattle penthouse before casually introducing her to his parents? In the middle of Lola Savannah, I decided that either this world should exist and I MUST become part of it, or this was all completely made up and therefore the stupidest book I've ever read in my life. I'm supposing, of course, it is the latter.  By the way, I think the only words I ever said out loud in Lola Savannah were ""Stop calling it a foil packet! It's called a CONDOM!"", which I screamed at my book. Luckily, no one seemed to notice. Two girls who were clearly sorority sisters from 3-4 years earlier were busy planning some stupid party with cupcakes, or poodles, or some such nonsense to even hear my completely inappropriate coffee house outburst.  In a daze of literary outrage and righteous anger that whoever wrote this drivel was a millionaire, I went back up to the counter and ordered an iced mocha. It was tasty enough, but in all honesty, the hibiscus tea seemed much more suited for a hot summer's day. And for calming me down during my ordeal.  I returned to Lola a second time, for much the same reason, and much of the same events re-occurred, except the second interview only lasted an hour. Decent coffee, nice staff.  I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that Lola Savannah is a pleasant, quiet, cute Westlake coffee shop...that I, personally, will forever associate with my experience delving into the world of ""mommy-porn"" S&M fanfiction schlock. So. Does this coffee shop make ""my insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid, desire""? No. Would I come back? Maybe. But only if there's some sort of coffee that would make ""the muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.""  Laters, baby.  4 Stars",1

But today when I went, I circled for 30 minutes and then tried valet and they were completely full and couldn't park me. So I had to leave.... No where in the entire parking area had a spot. This is a problem because now I'm at Triannon which is no bueno.

Coffee Shop 42,"8 check-ins This locally owned coffee lovers' mecca and remote working hotspot is hot for good reason.  In my two year relationship with this establishment (as well as it's sister wine bar) I've never felt anything but welcome and appreciated as a customer.    The single time I had issue with a service problem not only was my order free, I was given a gift card to use later.  The manager loves that we use them as a cycling launch point.  Fresh water to refill our bottles and (unrestricted) use of the restrooms are just the beginning. This is a customer service-driven establishment.  That my fellow neighborhood rats are feeling the long term relationship potential as well - it's full of regulars every time I visit - is just more proof of the quality found at Lola's!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"The Lola Savannah team are well organized and know what they are doing. I've been sitting here at the coffee bar for the last couple of hours working on my laptop, drinking awesome coffee and eating some pretty darn good food from The Grove menu. And while all of that is, in itself, worth a great review, what inspired this one are the staff that are working today. My barista hasn't stopped serving, busing, replenishing supplies and cleaning since I got here. So much cleaning. And cleaning. The blender is spotless already.  She's done more work with smile on her face, than I remember seeing anyone, anywhere.  Then there are three guys within sight just dealing with glass cleaning. One guy washing and another uber-polishing them with some fancy machine that looks like mini, rotating car wash brushes. Good job unnamed barista with the blue hair.

Coffee Shop 42,"One of my favorite coffee shops.  The interior has a mellow atmosphere, and if it's not dinner, you can sit outside at the Grove patio next door.  They have the best cinnamon rolls ever created, but I try to avoid them in favor of getting the delicious blueberry protein shakes after my workouts at the gym a few doors down.  And they are always stocked up on the local kombucha, so that's a definite plus in these dark days of Lohan.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but the occasional lattes I've had were yummy and had pretty designs on top.  My only quibbles are the prices, which are definitely high, even if you do get your money's worth, and a lack of outlets to plug in my laptop.",1

Coffee Shop 42,"Came here looking for a place to study that was away from the campus bubble and this place was worth the trip. Modern decor seemed a little upscale but found a place in the back to post for some time.  The baristas were extremely nice. Noticed we walked in with our backpacks and were curious as to what we were studying for. Waited 3 minutes for an awesome Vanilla soy latte with, to my surprise, an intricate leaf design in the foam.  Outlets were close by and convenient and the couches and chairs were comfy enough to sit in for about 3 hours. We probably could have stayed longer but were kindly informed  that a Happy Hour was taking place about 45 minutes prior to its start time, giving us plenty of time to get to a stopping point and head out.  The staff thanked us as we walked out and I immediately decided that I would love to hang out there again. Only downside I had was that the internet was ungodly slow at times, but it might have just been my computer or browser. Otherwise, I'll definitely head out there again!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"So a buddy calls me at 9:00 and says his building is having a fire drill. Do I want to head over to Lola's for a breakfast taco and cup of coffee? I of course say yes and when I walked in I thought NO! this place cannot have good breakfast tacos. Where are the guys in flip flops and wrinkled shirts, long sideburns and hippie girlfriends? This cant be good. I was so wrong. I ordered a cup of dark coffee,a  bacon egg and cheese taco and a bean and cheese taco. We sat down and the bacon egg and cheese taco was way better than most, served in foil on two fresh corn tortillas, I poured the dark roasted salsa over it and was in heaven. Done with that in a few minutes I turned to the filler taco- bean and cheese.  I opened it up and was pleasantly surprised to find it was a mixture of black beans whole and refried. Served on a very thin flour tortilla with cheese and some salsa mixed in. Oh sweet Lord in Heaven. It was the single best breakfast taco I have eaten in my 45 years. Bean and cheese, who knew. The coffee was great and in spite of the strip center location, traffic at the intersection and shiny new Range Rovers parked out front I cant wait to go back. Wrinkled shirt and flip flops and all.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"I am finally done with this place which is unfortunate because it has a lot going for it.  The space itself is aesthetically pleasing and it is very convenient to me, within walking distance.  I have never been crazy about their coffee but the baked goods can be quite delicious.  Unfortunately, the customer service is dreadful.  On numerous occasions I have walked in to find no one manning the counter and on other occasions the caliber of the person manning the counter seemed sub par.  Mostly I get the impression they would rather be doing something else.  Today was the final straw when I stood in line for over 10 minutes while the counter person carried on a personal conversation about her career aspirations with a customer while I stood there waiting.  I do realize you can't be rude to customers but she encouraged and extended the conversation without regard.  This lack of concern over the customer experience seems to trickle down from management since I have experienced it with multiple people at this facility including management.  Starbucks in contrast has consistent personnel, plenty of staffing and a genuine concern for personal service.  This is why they dominate the market.",0

The espresso drink art is very creative and unique.  The staff is also very cool about making creative drinks off menu.  Even putting all of that aside, the coffee is very high quality.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, clean and generally pretty cool.  It's not full of goofballs setting up a remote office there, or pissy hippies doing home work or looking up Phish shows, or couches to sleep or whatever they are doing at places like Austin Java.  It's mostly just hanging out, chatting, music, real life social interaction, and all that stuff.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the parking pretty much sucks.  If you just accept the parking sucks, and park far away, you'll get over it pretty quickly.  To be honest, I actually think the breakfast tacos suck.  It's a f'n coffee shop, not a taco store.

And they do coffee art, which I'm a total sucker for!  I went here wanting a delicious latte and left a little disappointed - the coffee was terribly bitter.  I'm not a fussy person but I couldn't drink more than a few sips because of the bitterness.  Perhaps I'm too spoiled by Catalina coffee in Houston.",0
Coffee Shop 42,Nice atmosphere and good coffee that does not taste watered down. They offer almond milk too.,1
Coffee Shop 42,The cappuccino and latte drinks I have had are very good - and the artwork in the foam of your drink is cool.  The ambiance is friendly and casual yet very appropriate for business meetings.  The place is packed with caffeine drinking folks having all types of business meetings at 10 a.m. - when you would think it would a little slow for a coffee shop.  The free wi-fi works great.  I feel like I should pay them rent I stay there so long sometimes.,1
Coffee Shop 42,"Nice coffee, decent pasty selection, nice selection of chilled drinks. Reasonable prices, try it you won't be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 42,Great ice mocha and a fantastic peanut butter cake ball,1
Coffee Shop 42,"The best breve latte in town and I believe I have tried them all.  They should be, as their espresso machine costs over $10,000.  The baristas are very good and consistently have the same people working there year after year.  The atmosphere is great too.  I wish they had a little more than breakfast tacos and some ho-hum pastries to go with their great coffee.  Overall, still 5 stars for the best coffee in town.",1
Coffee Shop 42,Some of the best coffee in town.  Relaxing and comfortable environment.  Bicyclist friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 42,"I love this place.  When I worked at a nearby school, I would stop here about 2x/week for a taco and green iced tea!  ALL THE SERVERS are great, and their taco has the  most wonderful white cheese!!!  Gotta have one!!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Perfect decor, awesome leather sofas, nice atmosphere, great coffee and even better service. The jewel in Westlake.",1

Coffee Shop 42,"I absolutely love Lola. My wife and I dropped in a few months back, when we were looking into moving nearby. As soon as we walked in and sat down, we knew that this would be a favorite place if we moved. The decor inside is perfect - trendy but comfortable and functional. The bar area and the benches along the wall are awesome. And not to mention the drip coffee, it's awesome. I like to order it in a cup and camp out for a while. And, you can order food from next door (The Grove).",1
Coffee Shop 42,"I live central so I really don't expect a whole lot from independent coffee shops outside of town. I've only had one coffee here but it was without a doubt, excellent.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Listed in Caffeination Stations I absolutely love the iced coffee here! As I've mentioned before, I would drink iced coffee while ice fishing in Fargo, and if Lola Savannah had a Fargo annex, I would do exactly that. This lovely little low-key lounge is attached to the Grove restaurant and wine bar, but has its own mellow ambiance. Not the spot to just pop in and grab a cup of coffee as the service is geared more to the laptop and conversation crowd. Their iced coffee is my favorite Saturday morning treat, and its location next to Lone Star Kolaches is ideal for snagging a few tasty bites for brekkie. Highly recommended!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Great coffee, comfy seating, and free wifi. I like it. It's a good place to relax and read. One of the best cups of coffee I've had in Austin.  The bad? The parking lot is almost always completely full so I can't even go here half of the time I want to. It takes a lot of luck just to get in the front door because of the full parking lot.  But the real reason I chopped off a whole star is that the staff is kind of rude. One guy in particular offended me so much that I wanted to splash my hot coffee into his face (I wish I'd gotten his name; I was THIS close to making a complaint to the manager about him). I go to coffee shops to relax, to read, to get work done. I go because I don't get bothered there like I do at restaurants.  So when I am here to do a LOT of work and have to stay here for like four hours, LEAVE ME ALONE. I came here on a day where I had a lot to get done and had to stay for a long time, but one guy working here kept trying to guilt trip me into buying more or leaving or something. Every time I went to the counter to order more coffee, he would say in a snotty voice ""you sure have been here a long time"". Over and over. He'd even come to the table I was doing my paperwork at and interrupt me several times with his snotty ""you sure have been here a long time"" comments, shoving a menu into my face. Was ordering a cup of coffee every hour in a near-empty room not enough to make me worthy of sitting there and doing my paperwork? I felt like I was being harassed into purchasing more and it made me feel really unwelcome.  So I like your coffee, guys, but I hope someone in charge there reads this and will remind the staff members to leave people who are planning to stay for a long time to get work done alone.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"This place is wonderful...I'm about to head over there for the third time this week.  The black bean breakfast tacos are delicious and the coffee is amazing.  Service is gracious; coffee is served in actual mugs, rather than paper cups and is brought to your table, if you're staying to drink your coffee there.  The music is unobtrusive, but up-to-date and the atmosphere is calm and relaxing.  Great way to start the morning and catch up on a chat with friends.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"The coffee is WONDERFUL, the baristas are friendly, the breakfast tacos are very good and the wifi is free.  I love this place.  I really think it's the best coffee in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"I generally come here on Sunday mornings.  Nice, clean atmosphere and never over crowded.  Coffee is great, breakfast taco's are tasty and the wireless has not failed me yet.  Not to mention, it's only 10 minutes from my house.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"First to Review thanks a latte! This is one of the best cups of coffee in town. Although the wait can be a little long at times, it's worth it. The coffee is fresh and wonderful. The atmosphere is fun... at night the mellowness of the surroundings combind with the aroma of the beans and wine makes you think you're in heaven (or at least not on Bee Caves Rd). Free wi-fi for you real caffiene addicts is also a perk... get it coffee - perk - oh never mind.",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Love, Love, Love Love the lattes here!  They know what they are doing.  I cannot even explain how perfect the lattes are at Lola!  Want great coffee with perfect crema?  Make a trip here!",1
Coffee Shop 42,consistently kickass coffee served by friendly folks. even the music is always good.,1
Coffee Shop 57,"Friendly staff, delicious coffee and tea beverages, and a relaxed atmosphere makes this a truly special place.  Today I tried one of the seasonal offerings, Apple Spiced Chai Latte. It tasted like a hot creamy Apple Cider. Cannot recommend it enough!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Raspberry Croissant. That is all.  Okay, okay - there's more, but that was my favorite item that I haven't had anywhere else. I really love how much space this place has. Seating everywhere! And with enough distance from other patrons. That's key. I hate going to a coffee shop and the people next to us might as well be having coffee with me because they are sitting so close. Awkward.  My latte was alright, a little watery. But the staff was chill. The space was peaceful and I love their branding. All people welcome, all ways. YES.  If I didn't live in LA, I would come back here. Well, when I come back to Austin... I will, I will come back here. Side seating... Beware of falling acorns The front The goods",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Not only is this place delicious, but they keep it comfortable, it has a nice atmosphere, and lots of outlets.  Perfect for people who practice the paleo lifestyle--they have homemade almond milk and homemade chai concentrate, both which are made with simple ingredients and sweetened with maple syrup! Almond milk cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 57,"2 check-ins Coffee at Seventh flag is pretty great! Definitely high quality. They serve a lot of sweet pastries as well as breakfast tacos and toast and such, so this would be a great place to stop by for breakfast as well. The service really stood out to me here as the staff were very genuine, friendly and accommodating; I wasn't sure what the pastries were exactly so the worker kindly explained each item.  I will say that their lattes are quite heavy on the milk flavor, so if that doesn't suit you, keep it in mind when you order!  The space itself is incredibly homey (it is inside an old home) and open, and very bright and well-kept. Seats have no back here, so if you're looking for somewhere super comfortable you may not like it here. I love the banner on the wall that reads ""Our country of friends"" and really makes the space feel inviting. There are also picnic tables and more seating outside.  Overall Seventh flag is a great social environment for coffee! Delicious almond croissant and a cap Very cute and homey!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Really nice coffee shop on South 1st in Austin. The baristas are friendly and the place is kept quite immaculate. I ordered a cappuccino to keep things simple, but they have a special drink over there called the Gibraltar, which is apparently similar to a cortado. My cappuccino was quite good - not the best I've ever had, but the coffee was good and the beverage as a whole was definitely made by an expert.  A personal gripe perhaps, but most of their seating is quite communal (ie they have a couple of really large tables), which makes it awkward for people who come alone and just want to sit at their own personal table. Empty mug of cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 57,"It cannot be a coincidence that Gourdough's and Seventh Flag Coffee are across the street from each other. An extremely strong cup of coffee to go with my extremely decadent sweet and savory donut? Yes, please.  I ordered a Gibraltar, which is a double shot of espresso and a bit of milk. It was sour and bitter and dark and complicated, and when the barista topped off the milk in the shape of a heart, I was smitten.  It's the perfect cup of coffee - the flavor balancing out the sweet and savory of my doughnut and the strength to keep me awake after. Gibraltar",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Listed in Coffee Popped into this shop on a walk exploring Austin, half for coffee and half to escape the rain. The big open space was interesting - it has a more open feel than many coffee shops, and was relatively empty when we arrived. We ended up with a Gibraltar  - equal parts espresso and milk. We had ours with the homemade almond milk, which was fantastic.  The baristas were friendly, and while the place seems like it might have a pretentious pour-over coffee shop vibe, it really doesn't.  The regular coffee was good; they have whole beans for sale too. And while you're there check out the great screen prints.  I'd go back!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"2 check-ins Listed in ATX! Hello Cold Brew. Hello ATX!  During our recent trip to ATX, we had the pleasure of getting our morning cuppa joe from Seventh Flag. I'm a sucker for cute, third wave coffee shops and was immediately sold when I saw the location, decor & comments regarding their cold brew.  There is plenty of seating inside and out. The baristas are kick-ass and friendly, and the prices were comparable to what you would find in LA. $4 cold brew is a must try and their croissants are HEAVEN. We stopped by here 3 days in a row and got a croissant every time (both plain & almond are delish). There is a small parking lot in the back, and plenty of street parking in the neighborhood. They also have Taco Deli tacos for sale - if you're looking for something savory vs. sweet. Across from Gordoughs on 1st!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Very memorable experience at Seventh Flag. It was my first time there and Matt went above and beyond to accommodate me. He gave me a sample of their nitro cold brew (they make it in house) and it was awesome!!!! He said they're the only coffee shop in Austin to make their own nitro cold brew. It's excellent. He recommended a wet cappuccino, which normally I would not be a fan of but this one was superb. It was the best way for me to taste the creaminess of milk and the brightness of the espresso. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try their other drinks. Thank you Matt for making me a customer!!!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"It's a simple place, with simple decor and to me these are compliments. I don't mind variety in menu items but at a coffee house it is all about the coffee.  Give me coffee or give me death! Try the Gibraltar; an espresso heavy concoction served in a shot glass, but sip it slowly to enjoy the craftsmanship that went into making this drink. Look at that art work, it tastes as good as it looks.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Good coffee, but what really makes it fabulous is the space. I mean, look at the photos! It's gorgeous! It's like an Instagramers dream!",1
Coffee Shop 57,Pretty cool vibe of this coffee shop and it's located in a really hipster area! Love the outside porch area. Perfect for enjoying a cortado in the sun :) See all photos from Mona K. for Seventh Flag Coffee Co,1
Coffee Shop 57,"While vacationing in Austin I kept running into really bad coffee - to bright, too bitter, too weak. I was beginning to think someone was wrong with me. Certainly all of the coffee in Austin wasn't all bad.  Lucky for me, it wasn't. 7th Flag was within walking distance to my air bnb and I wandered in one morning and ordered both a mocha and a plain ol' iced coffee. Both were perfect. I'm really glad I wandered in. This will be my go-to for coffee with in town. I didn't stick around to drink, but the store was clean, inviting and the staff friendly. Would absolutely recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Awesome place, great staff, great clean vibe, inside and outside seating, good espresso (slightly watered down, but still tasty), free super fast wifi and I'm sure a bunch more good stuff here I have yet to experience. Definitely a fan, definitely will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Stopped in this cute shop on a long weekend in Austin, I had an Iced Vanilla Latte (not too bitter, not too sweet, it was delicious!) and my hubs had a hot Vanilla Latte, and we would definitely stop in again! Wish we had time to have stopped by again! Friendly baristas, love the decor, and great coffee! Love the location, across the street from Torchy's which rounded out our Sunday late morning! Love this place! Would be a regular if I lived in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Great coffee shop in the SoCo neighborhood. Ordered the Gibraltar and the jam and ricotta toast, also got a drip coffee prior to leaving. Coffee and food was delicious. The inside of shop is clean and bright with lots of seating. They also had parking in the back which is nice in this busy area of town. Employees were super friendly. The menu is light so don't plan to come if you want a big breakfast but it's great for coffee and something light. They also had breakfast tacos from an outside place (forgot the name). My only complaint is that they didn't have half and half for the coffee, their only option is regular milk or almond milk. Gibraltar and jam/ricotta toast",1
Coffee Shop 57,"All I got here was a coffee, but it was very good. Their signature blend has noticeable fruit tones and is well balanced. That's the sort of coffee I like.  I bought 12oz of beans.  The price is higher than some coffee shops and there is a small selection of bean types and no options for pour-over of French press, but when your drip coffee is this good it'd be a waste of time!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Heard of this coffee shop from one of my Lyft passengers who was in town from LA. Came highly recommended and highly recommend it I will. Shared a cortado and cappuccino (pictured) both were very well prepared. The atmosphere was very welcoming and open inside. Plenty of room to spread out or head outside on their porch or picnic tables and people watch.  It's a little ways from the usual SoCo scene which  brought a calming, relaxing feeling rather than squeezing your way through shops or trying to get a seat at Magnolia. Gibraltar. & Cappuccino.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Listed in ATX Coffee Fix, ATX for First Timers I heard so many great things about Seventh Flag and finally had the chance to visit this weekend. Their parking spots were all taken (they probably had 5 spots total) but there was plenty of street parking on W Monroe with not a lot of traffic on that street.  Seventh has patio seating near the front and side. In terms of ambience, there was plenty of windows though it was strange to see the long table/main area not receive a lot of natural lighting--maybe it was the direction this shop was facing. In my opinion, the perfect spot at this shop is the nook where there is a small table with two stools and a couch--perfect for your Instagram photos ;).  I ordered their espresso set which came to around 3-4 dollars. The set included mineral water (Topo Chico?), espresso, and black tea that had faint hints of red fruit, particularly apple. All in all, it was a pleasant experience. On a side note, I hope they open shop at another location closer north closer to where I live. Ethiopian espresso set",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Poked inside this sleek space to find a world of quality-made coffee. Cold brew on point and almond milk latte just right. Everything from the space, design, coffee, and service will make this a Sunday tradition. Almond milk latte @ Seventh Flag",1
Coffee Shop 57,"18 check-ins Cool place, I've been going here for a while, but recently they are now serving espresso in a glass instead of the proper small cup. In the past they used to also serve a nice small tea sampler with an espresso, that is no longer done also.  Please bring back the small cups guys.",1
Coffee Shop 57,European experience with detailed barista and relaxing areas to enjoy.  Great place to hang out. European atmosphere and quality brew.,1
Coffee Shop 57,"Friendly staff, good coffee. These are my only requirements for a good coffee local coffee shop, and they nail both.  I wish the indoor was bigger, but they definitely maximize their space. Can't fault them for that.  Also, I must note that the staff is not only friendly, but engaging. Whether I'm there with my laptop to work, or my wife and kids to chill, they always take time to ask me how my day is going or what I've got going on. They always say hi to my little wild ones :).",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Great place.  Great service, and great location.  Clean, with good wifi.  Enjoy with confidence.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Updated review Rolled up with my daughter Saturday morning and ordered tacos, croissant, coffee, hot chocolate, and went to pay with Apple Pay, which I usually do at Seventh Flag. The reader wasn't working, and I had forgotten to bring my wallet. No problem! The awesome peeps at Seventh Flag just gave it to us on the house. Can't speak highly enough about Seventh Flag! The coffee and the service is just sublime, and they're truly a neighborhood business; they care deeply about their customers and the community, and the atmosphere and vibe is always inclusive and welcoming. Feel totally spoiled that they're our local coffee shop!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Listed in 2015 Yelp 100 Challenge I have been to this coffee place twice now and I think my favorite aspect of the place is the outdoor seating with picnic tables and large, old, character-filled trees. I have gotten hot drinks both times i have been and have been pleased both times. It is nicely placed across the street from a small food truck park so you can go get tacos or a donut and then eat them while you sip on your coffee.  The inside of the coffee shop is really unique, fairly modern and grey, but it is neat. I will probably visit this shop every time i am in Austin because the quality of the coffee is so good. Also, the drinks aren't ever too hot to burn your tongue.  I think my only complaint is the offstandish attitude some of the baristas have towards patrons.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Located across from the Gourdough's trailer, it looks more like a small home from the outside.  I came in to get a quick coffee fix and was impressed by the interior - it's very spacious and not crammed like a Starbucks layout.  The wooden tables are slick and there's an outdoor patio w/tables as well.  The ice coffee did the job.  I also bought some Tibetan Tiger tea bags to take home and it's quite delicious.  The people working there are all very cool and chill and welcomed me warmly when I told them it was my first time visiting.",1
Coffee Shop 57,Updated review Coffee is good but it's WAY overpriced. I just got a cortado (Gibraltar) and blueberry muffin and it was $9. The muffin was $4.50. I won't be coming back.,0
Coffee Shop 57,"Seventh Flag has been on my list for a while, but I finally came here on a Friday morning with some friends to do some studying and I fell in love.  The actual interior is very bright and pleasing to the eye, making it easy to study.  I ordered a vanilla latte, which came out fast and was delicious. It was smooth and creamy but not TOO sweet (coming from someone who likes sweet coffee).  The barista even put hearts in all of our lattes and they were both super friendly.  Overall, I think this is a great study spot - lots of places to sit and parking isn't terribly stressful. I will definitely be back! Vanilla latte - not too sweet, not too creamy!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I'm not a big coffee drinker, and I am sure it's great here, but I can't say enough about the Avocado Toast!!! How can something so simple be so awesome? I will definitely be back! Delish!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Pros - pretty space - lots of picnic tables outside - small parking lot out back - nice milk design on the hot chocolate  Cons - seating very limited and most very uncomfortable - no half and half (asked and told no, only had one kind of sweet soy milk) - hot chocolate my son ordered was flavorless.  He thought they forgot to put chocolate in. - coffee was much more bitter than we are used to, maybe because of mohair and half - kind of expensive",0
Coffee Shop 57,Great coffee with the best service. Wonderful place sitting out in the front yard watching 1st Street traffic. Become a frequent hang out now.,1
Coffee Shop 57,"Everyone here is so sweet, and you can bring your dog to hang out in the front. Really chill, great wifi, and the best almond milk cappuccino I've ever had. They make their own almond milk, and it really shows in any drink you order with it.  This place opens super early during the week and is a great spot if you're an early riser. Avocado toast is excellent - and a huge portion - you could easily split it with another.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Cool vibe, but they are very limited with their menu. Don't offer cream with their coffee only have whole milk.",0
Coffee Shop 57,"The aesthetics of this place matches the quality of its coffee! Wonderful, minimalistic interior, friendly service, everything is clean, and not pretentious at all.  A place with this quality usually tends to be overhyped by hip-on-your-face attitude: here they are chill, I like that.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"We were over soco and decided to explore. We grabbed two huge Gordoughs doughnuts and booked it across the street to this little fancy gem. It's simple! Grab a ""for here cup o'joe "" and chow down on that doughnut. #bestmemoriesmade Grab gordoughs, and grab a coffee",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Great atmosphere! Fast wifi! I ordered a Cortado that was amazing! My wife ordered a vanilla lattè that was just ok. Great music selection and a very cool staff. If I'm in Austin again, we'll make sure to stop by again! Great lobby area!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"that coffee beckons me. sometimes I wait for them to open. and that is early! I love the preciousness of their technique when they pour a filter coffee and earnestly explain that it takes 6 minutes to make one.  The decor is Swedish minimalist. a nice respite from the tchotchke-filled Austin  aesthetic of some old time places (the neon sign store is just down S 1st street). That old decor style filled with license plates and road signs is perhaps more booze that coffee. With 7th Flag, I think Austin may be moving away from all that - and this place and ones like it are saying, ""Hey Austin, there is more to life than 6th street. instead of going out carousing, wake up early and write a novel set in Stockholm, right here."" this was the coffee around Thanksgiving!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Tried the huckleberry ardi blend in a latte. Shot was dialed in perfectly. Two young ladies working were very friendly. Fruity latte, they will typically serve you a flat track dogspeed darker blend unless you ask for the single origin. Tried the flat track blend at the roasters shop and it was good as well",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Updated review 2 check-ins I came back here and had a great cappuccino. They have almond and whole milk so I went with milk. I got a bag of beans to bring back to Boston with me and the guy working the espresso machine listened to how I make coffee (cold brew), what flavors I like, and gave me a great reco. Love it here!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Adorable little coffee shop off 1st St and the perfect spot for a morning meeting or afternoon work session.  Staff is friendly, coffee was tasty & the venue was clean and pretty.

Coffee Shop 57,Clean and minimalistic. I wanted to try the cold brew because of the reviews but it was way too cold outside. Ended up getting the chai. It was great. A good mix of spicy and sweet.  A little overpriced if you ask me.,1
Coffee Shop 57,"Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee Seventh Flag Coffee Co is situated in a converted house on South First. It is conveniently a hop skip and a jump across the street from food trailers to include Torchy's Tacos. They have a welcoming outdoor area with huge shade trees. Outside you will find games and several picnic tables. There are a few parking spots in the back of the cafe otherwise you will need to seek out street parking.  The inside is open with communal seating and simple decor. Seventh Flag Coffee Co supports local by serving Cuvee coffee and Thunderbird Energetica bars. I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and was greeted with smiling baristas. I ordered a Cuvee Black and Blue which was perfect on a warm summer day. I enjoyed my cold brew outside which is perfect for people watching.  This would be a nice spot to work remotely, read a book or people watch on the weekend. Cuvee Black & Blue",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I visited on a Sunday Afternoon. The café is in nice location in South 1st Street, and even though of you don't get parking in the designated parking spot you can do a street parking.

Coffee Shop 57,"I'm visiting here in Austin for the Formula One Grand Prix and had a day to kill before the race festivities began. Being a self-admitted ""coffee nerd"" and lover of third-wave coffee culture I decided to take a tour of multiple local cafes. Seventh Flag was the second spot I visited, and I absolutely loved it.  The atmosphere was aesthetically inspiring; sleek and modern with an underlying sense of coziness as it is a repurposed home. Great seating arrangements with tables for socializing, and plenty of spots for artistic wanderers such as myself to sit and write. The noise level was somewhat high, however it was not anything beyond what one would expect at a coffee shop. I simply put in my IEM's and was pleasantly at home in the atmosphere.  More importantly the espresso the barista pulled for me was delicious. Slightly less bright then the flavor profile I strive for at home, but the combination of tobacco like flavor and butteriness paired really well with the chocolate they offer at the counter.  I absolutely loved this place, and it's an early front runner for the top spot of my visit. I'd definitely recommend checking it out",1
Coffee Shop 57,This was by far the best latte I've ever had in my entire life. Go. Now.,1

As a traveler to India, I'm a bit picky about where I buy chai a second time (first time, I'll get it anywhere because you never know who might surprise ya). Seventh Flag chai is the right about of spicy and toasty. My pup and I love walking over, settling in at a picnic table and spending the afternoon working (me on lesson planning and her on chewing bones). As a bonus, sometimes there's a pop up farmstand so you can not only get some good coffee, but also fresh veg!",1

If I lived in the area, this place would definitely be my regular stop!",1

They only offer whole or almond milk (no decaf, no half and half, no 1%, no 2%). Friendly, diligent staff that take their craft seriously. Highly recommend the avocado toast! I'd like to frequent this place however the 12oz latte for $4.50 and avocado toast for $7 - too pricey for what you get to become a regular. Avocado toast on challah bread with avocado, feta and hot spice Cinnamon toast - on challah bread Vanilla latte with whole milk",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Finally South First has a great coffee shop!  Apologies to the other coffee places along South First -- they're fine, but not on the same level as Seventh Flag, which is on par with the best of the new breed of coffee shops opening across Austin.    I appreciate their commitment to finding the best beans and honing the preparation. It's one of the two places in Austin where I've *never* had a bad cappuccino. The only knock is their baked goods are not my daughter's favorite, so it's sometimes hard to rally her to walk over with me.  Some of the other reviews out there mention unfriendly service, which is something I've never experienced there.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I love the atmosphere of this place, and the guy who took my order was so friendly! I only held off on 4 stars because my almond milk latte wasn't the best I've ever had, even though it was quite good. I also appreciated the fact that they use their own homemade almond milk, according to the guy who took my order! I would come here again for sure.",1
Coffee Shop 57,Was looking for a new coffee shop in my neighborhood and ran into this gem.  It was an even better experience when I noticed they also served Taco Deli breakfast tacos.  Winner!

Coffee Shop 57,"Love the spacious area and beautifully simple and elegant design. Feels like a modern living room. Their coffee and espresso were really high quality (Huckleberry roasters) and their chai is to die for. Only negative is that the baristas seem a little stand off ish. But love the vibe and I do frequent this place. Great location, great patio for good weather days. Also appreciate how the doors are left open for the breeze inside. :) solid place for some hangout and catchup or to get work done. A clean, nice elegant sign next to a majestic tree.

Coffee Shop 57,"This place is great every time I go. With an espresso order you get both a shot glass of Topo Chico and a shot glass of their own coffee infused tea. Nice touch! They also pour a top notch cappuccino. They have great rotating roasters, including Huckleberry (a personal fave) and Stumptown.  The thing for me that sets good coffee shops apart are the quality of baristas. Here, they truly know what they're doing. The dude with longer brown hair and glasses is an espresso master. Props to you man.  The interior is wonderfully modern and chic. Funny enough, I had designed my own condo in a very similar manner, and then a few months later Seventh Flag opened. Feels like home!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I rarely give five stars to a coffeeshop due to how many there are and how similar they are in quality.  Seventh Flag got my attention in a really good way.  1. Great cold brew coffee that comes from a kegerator.  I love that because it's novel and useful, not just there for the sake of being novel.  2. Clean.  Many coffeeshops are laid back and their staff also adopt the laid back approach.  This means that tables aren't cleaned up and often have crumbs, spills, or other general sticky spots that makes the neat freak in me grab a napkin and start wiping up.  Seventh Flag was spotless.  3. Fantastic space.  My husband & I actually took pictures of the high ceilings and rustic - yet not forced - decor because we enjoyed it so much and wanted to add it to our ""dream house"" lookbook.  Yes, we are that awesome.  A couple of slightly negative points that didn't detract from their overall five star-ness:   1.  Beard hair. The people who worked here were mostly dudes - heavily bearded dudes.  If they ever start serving food, it's probably a good idea to put some hair nets or beard bandanas on.  I've gotten beard hair in my food before and it was as gross as getting a pube hair, looks very similar too.  2. Not many outlets.  However, I personally hate it when people hog up primo space to charge up their laptops and NEVER LEAVE.  It's a coffeeshop, not a co-working space.  I highly recommend checking out this coffeeshop for its cold brewed coffee and just to chill and have a conversation or get a power hour in of work.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I ordered a small late and it was pretty good. However, I will never go back to this place due to the poor service. The brunette with short curly hair and tattoos making coffee was rude and unpleasant. She had an attitude and kept slamming dishes and utensils on the counter. Clearly she did not want to be there. Seriously? If you hate your job so much don't work there... You suck the energy out of the room and make guests feel uncomfortable.  On a positive note, I lucked out and got to sit at the small couch; that was pretty comfortable.",0
Coffee Shop 57,"Amazingly friendly staff, we're from out of town and they made us feel super welcome. Coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is friendly and bright. Love the aesthetic of the place as well",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Very funky, personable coffee place (old house, ample parking, super high-end coffee presentation) that is great for meetings or pretending you're writing your novel while actually playing solitaire or stalking old flames on Facebook. Unlike some indy coffee places, Seventh Flag is clean. That is good. I sense the dudes behind the counter (is the term ""barista"" trademarked by Starbucks? I don't want to get in trouble here...) know and care more about coffee than I ever will, so that's good. I know a little bit about how a plane works, but it's always good when the pilot is a few steps ahead of me... So, bottom line, good coffee, nice atmosphere, clean place, knowledgeable, friendly staff. Ample parking. Worth the trip.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"First of all, the latte I had was so amazing. It was a great temperature that I didn't have to wait to drink it and after my first sip I knew this was great coffee. Secondly, the atmosphere inside was superb. Also lots of outdoor seating which is a plus. I would totally come here to study, or just chill reading a book, or come with friends to hang. Great spot!",1
Coffee Shop 57,Nice little spot in Bouldin with a cool vibe.  Friendly staff and most importantly great coffee,1
Coffee Shop 57,"2 check-ins This space is beautiful, and such a quiet, pretty house in the south first neighborhood. There is great natural lighting and tacodeli, and the small parking lot in back plus curb parking is somehow always more than enough at times I've visited.  The furniture setup is interesting: I do think it looks great and it's definitely very spacious, but one large table is pretty much communal seating and outside of that, there's only a few tables that could be easily grabbed. Luckily, the seats outside almost double the capacity on nice days. I'm not sure it's cozy enough for reading, but the Cuvee is solid and it's a great place for small meetups or for studying or working.",1
Coffee Shop 57,These folks know how to make a latte. Beautiful minimalism. Plenty of outside seating. Latte perfection!,1
Coffee Shop 57,"Rainy, dreary day sometimes calls for hanging out at a cute coffee shop. Stopped by here today, it was already almost 3 so I got a chai and then later a london fog. Both were amazing! I wish I could have tried out the coffee but I would be awake all night. The chai was incredible, tastes like my homemade chai! So impressed it wasn't a boxed chai. The london fog was also delicious..the only other place I've had one (other than Starbucks) was Bouldin creek and their LF is very watered down. They use a regular tea bag here but made sure it was steeped for a long time before adding milk.I loved that they took as much care into making tea based drinks as they would their coffee drinks.  Every detail is important, even the mugs the coffee is served in which has a simple 7 on one side. I appreciate that a place like this exists in my neighborhood. There are already a ton of great places in the area but this combines all of them. For example, Fair bean has the light but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee anymore. Once Over has great coffee, but the room itself is kinda dark and drab.  The tables filled up quickly but by 5 a lot of the crowd had cleared out. I can't wait to drink their cold brew! It looked like a guinness coming out of the keg haha. they don't have much in terms of snacks but Regal ravioli is next door and I adore them!",1
Coffee Shop 57,Coffee and atmosphere were great!  It was perfect!  Love the balanced flavor.  The indoor and outdoor settings were welcoming and wonderful. The staff was friendly.  It is also across the street from Gordough's - yum!  I can't wait to return!,1
Coffee Shop 57,"Cold brew and fancy milk- sure, I'll try it. So glad I did! Baristas were super friendly and the coffee is delicious. Perfect patio to sit outside before the heat of the day kicks in",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Wow what a pleasant surprise coming through the neighborhood. We stopped here because we wanted some solid coffee to go with our gourdough donuts across the street.  We got the French press and the regular coffee. Both were fantastic, although the cold brew tap looked so good we wish we took and the baristas were super welcoming.  We took them to go but as others stated: fast wifi, decent outlet situation, and personally I found the seating comfortable while waiting.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"There are tons of signs outside that read, ""NOW OPEN,"" and so I was a little confused when I was told that they just celebrated their one-year anniversary. But what the hay.  Thoughts: --The coffee shop is austere, and modern, and clean. --The coffee selection is great. --The staff is not just friendly, but seem outrageously happy to be there. --There is a huge outdoor seating section, great for dogs. --Yes, the chairs are made of wood and, like any other modern furniture these days, are simply not comfortable. --There are about 5 parking spaces, but that's true of any place on South First. --The hours seem a little weird to me. Why do they close at 7:00 pm? --Misc thought: there could be more food options. There's a food park across the street if you're willing to risk your life playing chicken to get there. --The prices seem a little higher than some other comparable places but nothing that would require redirection. --The baristas (baristos?) compete in latte art competitions around town, so might be worth checking out one of those. --Good temperature, and good music to boot.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I really like this coffee shop. Decent lot parking and plenty of street parking, which is always great on S. 1st.  Interior decor is beautiful and simple. Most chairs don't have backs, so it's not a place I would spend a lot of time in, but great to drink a cup of coffee and skeedaddle. Also, would be good to grab a cup of coffee to pair with a Gourdough's donut across the street.  Baristas are super friendly. They usually have a decent selection of baked goods. Espresso is good, but I was disappointed in their chai. It was very watery and not so flavorful. Guess it's a sign I should stick to the coffee...",1
Coffee Shop 57,WOW BEST COLD BREW EVER.  Sitting there in the 99F weather that totally felt amazing seven flag coffee did the trick to cool my core. The cold brew needs nothing added. Perfect on its own.  perfect place to come read a book and enjoy some great coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 57,"The coffee, the location and the customer service is great. The interior space seems stale and uninspiring. It doesn't make you want to feel comfortable staying there for long. I wonder if it's the owner's intention in designing such a space. The reason why I go to coffee shops is because I need to get work done I couldn't get done while I'm at home. I don't care what music is playing the acoustics are horrible. I don't mind customers carrying on conversations but when the acoustics are horrible customers end up talking loud because of the music.  It is a dog friendly area and plenty of outside seating. The menu is pretty limited and parking can be tricky. There are other coffee shops I'd rather go to such as Buzz Mill, Vintage Heart, Cafe Creme, or even Coffee Bean than come here.",0
Coffee Shop 57,"Overpriced. Extremely slow. Indoor area feels like a Walmart bathroom. Outdoor area is awesome and it has a great location.  Once you get the coffee, it is pretty good.  Unfortunately, you need about 45 minutes to get it and to empty your bank account.",0
Coffee Shop 57,"Decided to check out seventh flag for a late afternoon pick-me-up. One of the things I loved: parking. There isn't tons of lit parking but a couple of spots were open when I got three. There is also quite a bit of close street parking.  The interior is clean and contemporary, lots of light colors and a large open area. There is a bit of seating inside, mainly at bar height communal tables. There Is also quite a bit of seating outside.  I got an Americano. My usual. And it was incredibly inexpensive, which was nice. After the drink was made, it was incredibly too hot to drink. I typically like my drinks less hot than most, but I felt like this was way too hot. But, of course, it cooled down. After it cooled down it was pretty good, it would be nice to go back there and work on stuff (it was sort of loud in there, but with headphones it would be wonderful)",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I don't drink coffee or many hot beverages so this review is really based on the fact that they carry Tacodeli tacos and Tacodeli isn't anywhere near my house or work. I will say that I have been disappointed when trying to call them to find out if they have my kind of taco.....they never pick up. In any case, super excited they have my favorite taco, sadly others also like it too and it sometimes sells out!",1
Coffee Shop 57,Used to love this place but they stopped serving many items including decaf.  It has a great atmosphere but that doesn't count for much when you don't have many drink options.,0
Coffee Shop 57,"Good coffee, cool vibe, awesome service. Definitely will come back next time I'm in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"I like the place, the coffee was great and I was about to make this place my spot but the woman who was making coffee is rude and her attitude makes it impossible to even want to order anything. She acts like you owe her something for being there. I heard many others have the same problem with her. I took one of my friends there and she told me she would never come back there again. The manager is nice and he gave us some free muffins which was amazing but the rudeness is not something I can tolerate even in heaven.",0
Coffee Shop 57,Delicious Tibetan Iced Tea - unique caramel flavors and beautiful swirled cafe lattes. Temperatures are hot and perfect every time on these drinks. Extremely clean & very well lit coffee house with charming servers.  My favorite treat are the scones. 7th Flag is for our country of friends Unique Farm Trailer license plates!,1
Coffee Shop 57,"This coffee shop caught my attention when I was driving by it one day and saw people drinking coffee on the porch of this stand-alone house. The inside has a sophisticated yet simple and clean feel and layout, with simple decorations (including a framed needle-point), a fireplace, and a nice wooden floor. It is very quiet inside and would be a great place to do computer work or read a book. I tried the tea, but they also offer coffee, smoothies, and baked goods.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Out of the many coffee stops in Austin, this one is up in my top favorites. It's so clean, modern, very light and open feel. I've always had encountered really lovely happy baristas that you could talk to forever. It sets the tone for an overall wonderful coffee experience.  It's never been overly crowded the times I've gone and I've always found parking in their back parking lot or close on the street.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"What a quaint little coffee place tucked onto South 1st...I didn't know this street had any more room for new businesses to do such great work with charm and atmosphere but, lo and behold, Seventh Flag Coffee did it. And with parking too.  There's a small porch outside in the front with a couple of tables and chairs to work from. The inside isn't huge like Dominican Joe or Monkey Nest but they've done a great job placing the seating so that there's many options and it feels spacious.  Coffee is good, wifi is good. I don't have to fight for a seat (yet). All marks of a great coffee shop.  I'm pretty sure is now one of my regular places I will be going to when I want coffee and a place to get some work done. Thanks, Seventh Flag!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Great coffee, atmosphere, and service. I thought I lost my keys there and Adam was very responsive to try and help find them! Turns out they were in my car...",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Great baristas, great coffee. They offer a variety of beans you can buy from local roasters. The interior decor is clean and cool. Definitely go. It's a local spot. Interior",1
Coffee Shop 57,"This coffee shop is beyond legit. I came here to study with my friend and she brought her pooch, so we sat outside on their pebble-floor patio in the sunshine. The wireless connection is automatic- simply power on and click the 7th Flag logo and gain access. None of those, ""What's your WiFi password?"" questions or authentication process. Inside, friendly baristas will serve your order, and you will notice the absence of a caffeinated beverage menu. It's very chic if you think about it, everyone knows all the coffee variations and ends up ordering their own version anyway. ""One small double soy latte for here, please,"" I asked, and the silkly, smooth latte was my reward. The foam was also perfection. Hats off to 7th Flag!",1
Coffee Shop 57,"8 check-ins This is my favorite coffee shop in Austin. I like getting lattes here, and usually go in the morning. They offer a selection of Taco Deli breakfast tacos, some prepared sandwiches, and pastries.  I've always gotten friendly service with no attitude. They are really the best.  Pros: Great Coffee, great baristas, and nice intimate interior.  Cons: Busy, loud, sometimes limited parking.",1
Coffee Shop 57,"Cute lil joint. The music isn't blaring, they take your order fairly quick, and the baristas are super chill. There's a small cold brew I had, in which I like my coffee deep dark roast, got me tweaking! Pretty damn strong- major plus because I don't wake up easily. Totally worth the $4-5 bucks. Oh, outdoor picnic tables are cool for people watching, hanging out or working.",1
Coffee Shop 57,I stopped here on a short trip to Austin for some coffee. I had their cold brew and drank it black. It was amazing! The atmosphere was very chill and relaxing :),1
Coffee Shop 29,"I was craving smores all day and finally decided to come here with my boyfriend before we began an entire night of studying.  The atmosphere is a great place for a date as it has a very cozy and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The smores were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are paying for the experience. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and snacks. Fast wifi was also a plus here for us.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in ATX The vibe in here is good, but  a place that still sells cigarettes deserves a couple of stars knocked off, but my lower star review isn't just for that reason.  I visited at 7 pm on a Saturday night and we waited at the bar for five minutes while bartenders just ignored us despite not being busy. The seating is comfortable and appreciated, but either people are supposed to bus their own tables but there's no signage around that, or the staff who again, wasn't busy, didn't bother to bus them and everyone instead had to sit down with other people's trash on the tables.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"This is based on experiencing multiple sides of Halcyon, the coffee and the cigar experiences.  The coffee was a decent experience, but still underwhelming when compared to other options close by. I tried both a macchiato and an americano. The macchiato would be more accurately described as a dry cappuccino. I should have known I was in for a lackluster experience when I asked for a ceramic demitasse and was told I would get it in a to go cup. The quality of the espresso extraction was also lacking with an off flavor that makes me think it was pulled a little on the short side and they tried to cover it up with extra foam. The Americano suffered a similar issue as the macchiato with the espresso flavors. It was drinkable, but definitely not something to order again. If I end up here again, I'll definitely avoid espresso based drinks.  The cigar experience was probably the biggest letdown. The humidor was adequate although quite small with a very limited selection but it was a decent selection so nothing wrong there. My complaint comes from their pricing ($13 for an Arturo Fuente Short Story) coupled with their solution for lighting the cigars - paper matchbooks. I'm glad I carry a cigar punch on my keychain because I'm a little worried how the stick would have been cut otherwise. I'm guessing that cigars definitely aren't a big part of their business, but at least having 1 proper butane lighter available should be a necessity for anyone trying to sell cigars so that matches can be avoided. If I'm expected to bring my own lighter, I might as well just bring my own cigar as well.  In general I definitely wasn't impressed by any part of my visit. I may give them another try at some point in the future, but it definitely won't include another trip to the humidor.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Heard good things about Halcyon, so I was glad I was able to stop in for some coffee one morning last week. The Thai iced coffee caught my eye so I ordered it. It was delicious! Very rich flavor and extremely satisfying, especially on a scorching hot day. I only wish Halcyon were closer to me so that I could have the Thai iced coffee whenever I want. The coffee shop also has an interesting, and very comfortable, atmosphere.  Taste | 5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4.5",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 4 check-ins So, I popped out of the relationship I was in when I first wrote my review. And since that delegation have been back to Halcyon numerous times.  Pleased to report that my love of this place was not tainted by the rose colored glasses of my former relationship.  Yes, seating here is going to suck. It's hit or miss when you come in. But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.  Love this place. The employees are awesome, the bathrooms are clean, and just remember....be aggressive when you see a seat free up!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Consistently disappointing. I'm speaking about the service, not the food or the quality of coffee (though both are rather mediocre). I can think of very few instances where a barista or bartender or server has been outright cruel to my face. Sadly, the tall dark-haired male behind the bar tonight was really truly... a jerk.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Nice bright, modern bar and cafe located in downtown Austin.  I came for breakfast and ordered the Overnight French Toast with a Cappuccino. I was a bit confused that despite being ""eat in"" my cappuccino was made as to-go. But it was alright. The french toast isn't your traditional french toast, it's actually pretty dense...more like a bread pudding construction. But it was still very good, I actually enjoyed the more dense, cakey texture.  All in all, it was a good breakfast. There's no rush on the tables and the atmosphere is just fun and lively! French toast Panoramic",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The food here was delicious. They have a beautiful selection and the location is open and comfortable. I arrived for breakfast and got a cream cheese bagel with salmon! Yum! The coffee was A-OK and... Jeez... What a beautiful selection of drinks and food. Such variety! This is a great place to come during your morning work routine, or for a date, or for a reunion with an old friend! Yay!  Why didn't I give it five stars!? They were filming a movie! And, no, it wasn't cool. It was bothersome and it seemed to make the service... Less attentive. I know this may seem like a grumpy review, like, darn you kids and your fancy Polaroid cameras!!! But it really was annoying. The cashier wasn't the most polite guy. I didn't know you were supposed to order up front first (you order up front first!). And he kinda treated me like I was an idiot. It was not welcoming... It was more like, ""oh you DON'T come here all the time?! Well allow me to make you feel like a lesser person."" Yuck. If I wanted judgment I'd go to Burger King and order a pizza. Filming a movie! Set in a restaurant?! I bet it's thrilling!!! (Sarcasm) Yum!!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins Halcyon is like that sweet spot coffee joint, you know?  Like you have to go when you're in the area even if you don't want coffee at the time.  And if you don't want coffee you can have adult beverages, (there's a nice long bar), buy cigarettes ( I don't smoke but they have a huge wall of packs) buy cigars, (they have a humidor room!!!)and even delicious desserts. Like the smores- which is a must, they give you a little gas flame thing and you can melt your own marshmallows. Great Austin-y joint if you want to take your out of town friends...great place to chat and even to work. inside and outside seating. Parking is...well, whatever you can find! Vanilla latte Humidor room.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Ordered a $4 egg panini and a $2.50 cup of coffee. When I checked my credit card statement, they had charged me $9.74. No idea what happened there.  Brusque service at the counter. Not many food options.  Coffee was good. Egg panini was ok, but needed more sauce of some kind on it. Interior space was very Austinish with a variety of places to sit.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Weird service and one of the guys had really off social queues for customer service. When you approach a counter you expect the person serving to ask how they can help, or what they can get for you, or how it's going, etc - But he just kinda stared at me waiting for me to say something. Seems like a lot of kids come to hang out here. The s'mores seem like a cool deal but in the end you get basically two s'mores sandwiches if you're sharing and it's nothing special, the novelty of making your own s'mores in a coffee shop wears off quickly. They forgot two of our drinks because one of their bartenders basically just walked away so I had to ask for it. Didn't really eat anything else, but I'm sure they have other cool stuff to eat. I'm okay with modern coffee shops and it seemed pretty Austin-y but this place just didn't vibe with me that well.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"I have tried Halcyon a few times and have consistently had a good experience. The s'mores (what they are known for) are fun but a little overpriced for what you get. During my most recent stop here, the graham crackers were slightly stale. I also wish the marshmallows were a little bigger!  Now for the good. This place has an incredibly mellow/relaxing vibe. It is great for people watching or just stopping in for a drink/coffee. I have not tried their alcoholic drinks, but their coffee is delicious! The customer service here is solid, and it usually isn't too crowded to find seating.",1
Coffee Shop 29,I loved how friendly the staff were here! And it's awesome for people watching and chilling out. The prosciutto Flatbread was delicious! Funky wall at art at Halcyon,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Came for some Sunday s'mores and coffee. I got the Guatemala pour over which was strong, and delicious. Nice seating areas. There were lots of younger couples/students here. Not a problem, just an observation. The s'mores were a fun experience. Definitely worth bringing a friend here if they are visiting to have a cup of coffee and a catch up chat before going about your day. 4 stars though because other chocolate options would have been appreciated. I know Hershey's are original, but the choice would have been nice.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Pretty neat spot for late night coffee/beer/dessert downtown. I came on a Monday night and they were still hopping in the late night at around 11pm. It was world music night and about 10 different people came to jam out on an array of different instruments, playing music from India, the Middle East, Spain, etc. Everyone together. They were great and people in the audience started dancing. Totally unexpected and totally an element of why Austin is so amazing to create spaces for this to happen and in such unexpected places.  Had a great time. Nice folks at the bar.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"This spot is literally perfection - smack dab in otherwise dirty downtown. A modern interior with tons of intimate couch seating, or traditional bar type seating if you prefer. This place is the perfect pitstop. We arrived here on Friday night and ordered drinks and 'smores. I love the coffee meets dessert meets drinks aspect here, it's refreshing compared to the rest of the dirty 6.  The only thing that's a bit gross is the fact that their restaurant is open to the public and we saw the most random people walk in and use their bathroom which kinda marred the vibe a bit.  Otherwise, I love everything about this place - I'm sure it makes for the perfect daytime brunch and coffee spot as well! A must-visit if you're in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"What a cute place!  I heard so many good things about their s'mores, and I was in such a s'mores kick so I had to try it out.  I can't say it worked perfectly, and made my marshmallows nice and crisp and gooey on the inside, but It tasted fine!    Their coffee is also very delicious.  I love Austin coffee anyways.  Their beans are so aromatically wonderful.  Great place to go to with a group, or even alone!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Great place - definitely hand pour coffee - if you don't like black you must try this one black no sugar no creamer etc. was a fun chic place to hang out at.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"A friend recommended that I try Halcyon while I was in Austin and I'm so glad I did! My barista was actually from the same town I am, which was absolutely insane to me because it's over 500 miles away! This coffee shop is in a great location and not too far from anything! I ordered an iced latte and my husband got a chocolate frappe and both were excellent! Halcyon has a full bar, so you can add a shot to any drink you purchase. The ambience is awesome, and there is a ton of comfy seating. Their art is mostly from local artists and right now they have huge glitter paintings of celebrities and I almost emptied out my savings account for one of them, but you can't exactly fit a 40x50 canvas in a carry-on bag.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List This is my go to when I am late night raving on 4th.  It can be a bit packed, the baristas a bit pretentious, and the wait time a bit too long...but you are in downtown ATX, kiddo and you gotta learn that this is the norm somewhere so it might as well be where they have ""DIY s'mores"" and killer Thai Iced Tea (w/a shot of espresso, it is DIVINE!) and is one of the better ""after all the bars close"" people watching perches!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"A date night place if I've ever seen one before. It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.  Well, that minor detail aside, I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire.",1
Coffee Shop 29,Very nice a clean setup. Food was very good for a light breakfast. The French toast was just as good as mother made. Great morning breakfast in Texas.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been coming to Halcyon for years, every trip I take to Austin. I've always been a fan of the cute and cozy furniture, the fact that they have alcohol, food AND coffee, and that the atmosphere was chill.  But this last visit was all kinds of disappointing. I would love to blame it on the fact that I was extremely hungover, but I was the only one that was and everyone else was pretty bummed out by the time we left.  We walked in as a group of 6 girls. We ordered individually, food and drinks. It took 20 minutes for the first girl's food to come out. It was just a sandwich. Then another 20 for the next plate. By that time the first girl had finished eating. 10 minutes later, two other plates came out. Followed by two more, another 10 minutes later. It was a ridiculous amount of time for extremely easy food to prepare.  On top of that, the food was inconsistent. My side salad didn't have a dressing, but two other girls' did. Two people ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, but they looked different. One was missing what looked like a sundried tomatoe type of sauce. The food tasted mediocre, at best. At least it was something in our stomachs. But the most laughable thing was the egg panini with sausage. I posted a picture. Literally one sausage patty cut in half, for the entire sandwich. We were so done with the whole experience that we just laughed it off.  There are so many other local coffee shops in Austin that likely won't be returning to Halcyon for a while.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is a really nice place if you're looking for an edgier place to chill with some friends on a late night for coffee or dessert.  It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit pricey here, but I do like the environment here, and the fact that it's open quite late.  The chocolate cake is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of snacks. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For people just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get dessert, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go. But if you're already downtown, or live in Austin, definitely check it out.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The bartender (Kiki) with the big black hat was amazing!!!!! She had such amazing vibes and she really gave us top notch service!!  -jared sex toy boy  -----  When you come downtown, make SURE you stop at Halcyon. Its a cute little bar across from the gays. Say hi to my girl Kiki! Shes fab, famed, and goiiigeous.  Ask her for the special. You'll be in luck ;)  - jetGlobal",1
Coffee Shop 29,Very tasty coffee drinks. The avocado toast is underwhelming but the turkey brie sandwich is amazing!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Love, love, love Halcyon. My office is nearby so I'm a regular there for coffee and coffee drinks. The coffee is good and the specialty drinks are varied and terrific. What really makes Halcyon great though is their wonderful staff. Just a great bunch of people that are super friendly and make everyone feel welcome. Caffeine junkies should ask for the Quad Latte. Also, the breakfast tacos are fantastic. Excellent place to day drink as well for those so inclined.  Great place for tourists to get their bearings on a visit since you're in the warehouse district and close to Congress and Sixth. My personal favorite of the many downtown coffee shops.",1
Coffee Shop 29,First time here. I just had the most delicious brownie and most incredible latte that changed my life!!! All i got to saw is WOW!!! The atmosphere is so comfy and free wifi. What else does anyone want!!! Location is perfect too.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"So many issues here... 1.) the service was horrible and it took forever to get our food 2.) one member of our party did not receive her food and when we asked about it, they claimed that ""she cancelled her order."" FALSE 3.) they finally did bring one portion of her food, but forgot the other and we finally requested a refund. 4.) they gave us a sheet of paper that said ""cancelled order""  when we asked if the card would be refunded they said ""um pretty much"".   What does that even mean?!? 5.) the staff was rude 6.) the food was not good at all",0
Coffee Shop 29,"3 check-ins As much as I love your coffee shakes and your table side smores, doesn't justify your employees acting rude towards customers. You have one job and one job only and that is to deal with customers and ring them up. If you can't be friendly with the customers then you shouldn't be working here.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"3 check-ins The Good: This place is pretty consistent in everything it offers. Good coffee, vibe, people, service, etc. It's not you're usual coffee shop. On any given night you can find live music, smoke hookah or roast some marshmallows and make s'mores.  The Bad: as in most dt locations if you're looking for a work-place or a stop-and-go coffee this is not a easy place to stop at, unless you live downtown. Parking around this area is not easy, but not impossible.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've only been to Halcyon a few times in the company of friends who knew some of the bartenders/baristas. Based on those experiences, service and the price of our cocktails was quite reasonable. Absurdly reasonable.  Nepotism aside, I really enjoy the environment at Halcyon and the enormous selection of drinks they offer. It's hard to beat sitting outside on a pleasant fall day and people watching. I've never gotten the S'Mores before, but it definitely looks like quite a fun thing to do and would be perfect for a date.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Coffee was great - had an iced latte with an add shot and coconut milk. Very satisfying for that coffee craving. Place also serves food, alcohol and cigars. Bathrooms were clean, too.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Hipster coffee house, spirits and smokes. Had to check it out.  We had lunch here and went the boring route of just getting PG versions of the coffee. Although the espresso martini was tempting me.  The soy latte was very nice. My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For lunch, I had the walnut apple salad. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with bacon, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for lunch. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"". I need to come back and try one of these espresso drinks. A soy vanilla latte The apple walnut salad - very yummy! See all photos from Suann G. for Halcyon",1
Coffee Shop 29,"This place was good, but not great. The positive was the location, they had a lot of seating and the outdoor seating is great for watching people and traffic. I ordered the turkey Brie sandwhich. The salad was good, the greens were very fresh. The sandwich was good...but not great. I am a huge Brie fan and I couldn't even taste it. But for a lunch sandwich, it was good. Make sure you have time to wait though, it was about 20 minutes!!!! The place was extremely busy starting around noon. We didn't try the coffee, we went around the corner to caffe Medici!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Amazing lemon drop martini. Wonderful vibe. I am not a big fan of the food, but I still have to try the smores :)",1
Coffee Shop 29,Would have been a cool place but the bartender poured absolute vodka instead of grey goose then tried to hide it. SMH.,0
Coffee Shop 29,"PERFECT DATE PLACE!  This is my go-to place for a date and I definitely recommend. We always order the s'mores and it is so much fun. They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows, hershey bars, and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The atmosphere is super chill. I've been when they've had a live musician. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and tables and tallboys. It's across from all the gay bars and next door to Cedar Street Courtyard which are both fun spots to check out after you enjoy your s'mores.",1
Coffee Shop 29,Not sure why I made such a big mistake by not ordering the s'mores but I think I need to come back and try it.  Came here to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was decently packed but nothing to crazy.  I ordered the Iced Latte and sat down for a couple hours to do some work.  The wifi was nothing to crazy but it did the job.  The overall environment in Halcyon was really nice.  Not too loud but not library silent.  I would highly recommend this place for a ice quite place to work or talk to some friends.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"19 check-ins Ahhh Halcyon. This place is a classic and is definitely a place I'd recommend you checking out, especially if you're visiting Austin. Whether it's during the day or at night post-club/post-bar, this place never disappoints.  The s'mores and drinks are amazing here. I highly recommend you try the espresso martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available. Of course if you come at night, especially during the weekend, it may be a tad difficult to find seating. Fortunately, there's also seating outdoors. S'mores and espresso martinis.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The wife and I stopped in late night after dinner. I needed a little caffeine before the drive back to our hotel. We stumbled upon Halcyon and it had a great vibe going on. We lucked out and got a little corner area to sit and take in all the action as we had a view of the whole place. Now this review is mainly for the cold brew coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores dessert that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few tables. I'm sure that they have some other food options, but we really didn't take a look at the menu other than for coffees and teas. We would definitely return and hang out at Halcyon whenever we find ourselves in downtown Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"We got breakfast here to kick off a day in Austin - it was pretty great. Good selection of all the coffee beverages you'd want. Iced coffee was a good - not too bitter, just the way I like it. We also got the Migas breakfast tacos with avocado cream. They were really good, but beware the red salsa - it is extremely spicy. Also enjoyed the overnight French toast. Service was friendly and the place was very quiet and peaceful on a Sunday morning.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange lighting, live music (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous people on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very cozy and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your table? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My cappuccino came in a giant cozy mug. My friend's latte came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The baristas were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate atmosphere for whoever you choose to come with. Open late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an americano and peppermint latte in the background",1
Coffee Shop 29,I had the cosmonaut and it was pretty darn good! The vibe is chill and their music playlist was bomb(in a good way). We also ordered the s'mores and it was really fun and tasty too! Too bad we aren't from Austin because Id probably be here all the time if we lived here! Smores!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Cool place that has Austin written all over it.  Good food, polite service, and excellent coffee.   They even offer their own brand of coffee for sale.   Would certainly recommend this place to a friend.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"What are you in the mood for? Coffee?, wine? Mimosa? Or a cigar? This place seems to have it all...what they don't have is table service, so be prepared to order at the register! Food menu is limited. Bar at halycon.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"OVERALL: great place for a quick bite for dessert on a date!  AMBIENCE: perfect little place to go for a date with mild lighting and couches for you to sit. These couches have very comfortable pillows to make you feel like you're in your own home. There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live music playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.  TASTE: we had the smores for 2 people which was about $7. It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but pay at the counter and they bring it to you. They don't really check up on you until you are on your way out. Staff is nice though! Basic smores for 2 with moist towelettes for the mess! Date night with the private corner of pillows! Super comfy, I thought I could fall asleep there.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Really needed some coffee around midnight since we flew in on a Friday and were tired from the traveling.  We were really surprised how there was a cafe right in the middle of downtown where the party was happening!  Got an iced latte and it was good.  Very nice espresso with whole milk.  Tried a bit of the soy chai latte and typically I'm not a huge chai fan, but it was some tasty brew!  Didn't try the food, but plenty of people had drinks from the bar also on a Friday night.  The atmosphere is definitely on the cool side.  Outdoor area is great for people watching.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"After a stroll on town lake with a friend in from California, we wanted to grab a cup of coffee and be able to chill out to people watch. I had my dog Nymeria with me as well so I suggest Halcyon because of the seating outside and I've heard people rave about this place. This was a chill day after New years winter day in Austin so the weather was perfect. We parked nearby and my friend waited outside with the dog so I went in to order. The line was about 5 people deep and the inside place was pretty full. One thing that I thought Halcyon did well is the different flavors of hot chocolate. I ordered their special of the day which was Mocha La'orange (mocha with an orange zest) and my friend got their Mayan hot chocolate (spices and cinnamon). I asked about how long the drinks would be so I know about what time to come back inside to grab them, the barista said 5-7 minutes. Usually I wouldn't care but we also had a parking meter ticking for 30 minutes. I came back outside and I loved where we sat because there was heat lamps above to keep us warm. I did notice however where we were were the only place with heat lamps, no where else on the patio. After about 7-10 minutes I went inside and was hoping my drinks would be on the counter. No one acknowledged me and I looked around to see if the people that were ahead of me got their drinks already, not yet either. About 2-3 more mintes pass by and the couple that was infront of me in line finally got their drinks called so I figured ours would be up soon. Turns out I end up waiting another 10 minutes for our drinks. End of the story, took us 20+ minutes to get the coffee drinks, not much people watching was done on my part because I spent all that time inside, my dog got lots of praises for being cute, and we were just a few minutes late back to the truck after the meter ran out.  Dont get me wrong, our drinks were pretty good, but I would not come back here again when there are so many much better service at other coffee shops in town that also serve a good cup of joe.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is a perfect stop for an afternoon coffee or late-night drinks with friends. The vibes, staff and patrons are friendly - a refreshing change of pace from those other manic, packed downtown ATX venues. Grab a local beer with some friends and enjoy this unique venue. True, authentic Austin charm.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Sometimes Mr. Smidgens like to chill. . You can chill with your friends or choose to chill alone.  Halcyon is the place to make this happen. Soooo, chill. The bar of course!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in The Attraction of Austin When I checked in here, Yelp asked me, ""Is this place Hipster?""  The answer is DOUBLE YES.  I almost caught myself on fire walking past the mini-grills, as everyone made s'mores on their tables.  Regardless of your feelings toward the Hipster...movement...Halcyon is a fun place.  They have eight different kinds of hot Toddy's!  Eight!  The Buttery Rum is absolutely delicious.  A friend ordered coffee with Bailey's and was happy as a clam.  Their signs were funny - ""Are you hungry? We'll get you drunk. Are you thirsty? We'll get you drunk. Are you lonely? We'll get you drunk.""  The drinks took quite a while to make, so come by if you've time to chill out and aren't rushing somewhere. ""Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, all the vices in one place.""",1

Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 3 check-ins Generally enjoy Halycon. Daytime and nighttime. Drinks and snacks are good, especially the Insomniac. I like working on my laptop here but fundamentally believe I shouldn't be forced to buy TWC Wifi because Halycons connection is so bad. Reconsidering my default work spot.  Update: Internet connection seems to be much better! Owner also contacted me on Yelp to apologize. Yay!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Coffee was fine. But I waited 45 minutes for my flatbread order even though it wasn't really busy. After 30 minutes of waiting I asked them if it was almost ready and apparently they totally missed my order.,0
Coffee Shop 29,"We love this place. It's all kinds of coffee, liquor, and food goodness wrapped up in the best vibe ever.  The service is warm and friendly. You are in the South, you know.  The atmosphere is chic and casual. Noise levels are completely perfect for intimate conversation and they have outdoor seating.  We visited multiple times on our last visit to Austin and mostly did coffee and breakfast. Both very tasty. We did come for a cocktail in the late afternoon and the bartender made a concoction that was delectable. The Bees Knees, I believe.  This is a place I recommend frequently to friends visiting Austin. You should go.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Disappointed that they ran out of french toast when we went, but their panini was very delicious - a must have! Egg panini w sausage and cheese - amazing",1
Coffee Shop 29,Came in for coffee on our way out of Austin.  We all decided to get Vietnamese coffees.  They were so delicious! Even the non coffee-lover we had with us enjoyed it.  Perfect on temperature and sweetness. Vietnamese Coffee,1
Coffee Shop 29,The coffee was great the atmosphere was comfortable. A great spot to be if you want to be downtown and not in a bar or club.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"This place is a cool hang out. The decor in this place is awesome, with great lion artwork on each wall. They have a pretty extensive liquor selection, and they have a pretty wide variety of beers. The only thing not great about this place is they do not have a tap for beers or cold brew coffee. If this place had that I would give it 5 stars. Still a cool place though. All the art in the shop is lion themed Beer and liquor selection",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Cool vibe, great art on the walls and music. There is a full bar, coffee and snacks. Plenty of room to chill and get some work done.  If you think of what has happened to Cecil the lion, then all the pictures of Lions will get another meaning. Like a reminder for us people, that we owe to the Animal kingdom.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"7 check-ins MUST TRY!! Absolutely adore the iced mocha. The iced vanilla latte was also good compared to other places I have tried. For both iced drinks it was $10.28 so it was a bit pricey, but I don't think that will deter me (my poor wallet lol). I didn't really investigate for stamp cards, but I will next time.  The inside was very cozy and had great Austin flare. A good amount of seating ranging from couches, to tables to little pillow bed-ish couches in the corners. I think it's a great place to study or come from brunch. They do have a food menu but the times which breakfast and such are served is limited. I came in for a waffle that I saw on yelp but I came in too late. Coffee barely lasted until the end of the review",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins Fun atmosphere and vibe. I ordered a coconut mocha drink that was too sweet until it watered down a bit. A friend ordered a coffee that was just slightly above room temp, while another friend ordered hot tea that felt like it was heated on the surface of the sun. There was little to supplement the hang out experience. Their wifi was abysmal even though the place was relatively empty at the time (I have seen it much more congested). The board games had missing pieces and the restroom door did not lock properly nor was it very clean. Considering the hype for this place, the experience fell short.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"bleh.  A cool concept, cramming a lot of different things (coffee shop, bar, restaurant, patio, etc.) into a very small space. What I've tried (mostly coffee) has been pretty good but the low rating is due to the smoke. You can't get through or even around the place while trying to walk by without breathing in smoke, it's horrible. The ""15 foot"" law is completely and utterly ignored.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"I love going here on a random night out. They have a great selection of coffee and tea! Warning: their drinks are extra hot (as they should be). Not lukewarm like some places. They even have s'mores. I mean, need I say more? It's a great place to take your friends from out of town or a coffee date. My favorite is the earl grey tea there. S'mores!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Favorite Coffee Shops This place was so neat! I've heard so many things about this ""smores bar"" place and it didn't disappoint! We had a party if 4 and order the big platter of smores and 2 glasses of wine! The wait staff was super friendly! We were from out of town and they recommend a few other places to try!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Friendly service, fun atmosphere and free music. Everything an evening spot should have. They also have outdoor seating and a walk-in humidor! Awesome Ginger toddy. Delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The two things I ordered at Halcyon both involved chocolate.  1) S'mores This is an ingenious idea that I wish more coffee shops did. It was freezing (for Austin) standards and I had a lot of fun torching marshmallows (and watching my girlfriend light a few on fire) before squashing them in between some Graham crackers and chocolate. Love it.  2) Some sort of chocolate martini thing. I don't really know what it was because I was drunk, but it sure was yummy when I had it! You should be able to figure it out when you get there.  Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seats for its location downtown. You seat yourself, and I think most people have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having. There aren't many electrical outlets handy, so that certainly helps keep the stereotypical buy-one-coffee-and-stay-all-day-on-your-laptop customers away.  I highly recommend it as a good meet up spot and date location! The bar",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been coming here for years, like 7 years. I did come a lot to day drink because the bar opens at 7am! Well today I'm here for coffee and avocado smash toast, which is toast with avocado and salmon. There's only 3 people in this entire establishment and this toast is taking over 32 minutes. Man this place sucks",0
Coffee Shop 29,"It was super crowded however, I loved the atmosphere. Amazing coffee. S'mores were amazing! I will go back during day time hours. 9:00 on a Friday evening is a little intense.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins This place rocks!  I'm from Chicago with a Starbucks on every corner. I love visiting independently owned coffee houses. But most don't have such an awesome food menu. On a short trip to get out of the cold weather, I stopped here twice. Customer service is beyond expectational!  Both times, I asked if menu items could be tweaked or combined to reflect my low-carb way of eating. Not only did they help me figure out the best meal, the food was awesome and beyond what I anticipated!  And most importantly they didn't act like I was putting them out. It has a great porch, clean restrooms and the ambience is really nice!  The coffee is delicious too! Specially made salad.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Very cozy, eclectic coffee shop with a hip vibe.  Located right on the corner, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.    Had the Nutella/Banana Belgian Waffles, Egg/Bacon/Cheddar panini, and slow pour coffee.  The food is fresh and very well prepared, but most importantly, it was delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Great coffee and breakfast spot! On the more quiet side of town. Egg panini was fantastic!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"This is a great breakfast place! I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a breakfast sandwich comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy breakfast at this low key joint. The sandwich itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of caffeine, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the barista actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local artists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have cozy places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The baristas are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the wifi is free! As a business traveler, it was nice to get on quickly without having to login or see any ads. This was definitely a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place to travelers, and I hope it's a hit with the locals too! Lox bagel and Thai iced coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Popped into Halcyon 10:30pm on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed but we managed to find a nice seat. The employee taking our order wasn't pleasant and had a very fast paced attitude. We went with the s'mores for two, a mudslide, and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!  They had this dreamboat guy singing indie music, he had such a wonderful voice, we clapped with all our hearts after each tune and we received death stares from people reading their books...sheesh!  FUN FUN times at Halcyon! S'more fun!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Three of my favorite things in life: coffee, cocktails, and dessert. Great location too. Visited a few times so far, first time had lunch, other times had drinks, coffee, and s'mores on the last date. Only comes with one or two servings so would have been down for a double order. Because of the night time buzz people seem very social even in the day time for a cafe when you want to just be working with wifi. Not the silent-whisper to your friend kind of cafe. Good times.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Good place for coffee. Espresso was a bit watered down, though their La Marzocco machine is nice and I suspect it was just a poorly dialed in shot (but they obliged to give me a pull of a single origin). Iced toddy brew and cappuccino were solid. Good seating inside and out.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 2 check-ins Went here one night with my little sis to catch up since I moved to Houston, and what a great place to do so! We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores snack/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The cashier up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The atmosphere is really chill. A nice cafe to go to when you don't wanna be dealing with 6th street drunkards. I do gotta say though claim your seats swiftly and quickly! Dem seats are in demand.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"A very relaxing cool atmosphere. My bestfriend who visits Austin often comes here during the day to get coffee and do her art. She loves this place and told us to come by!  I ordered what my friend usually gets which is a hazelnut frappaccino. It was so delicious not too sweet and had so much flavor! It is a bit on the really creamy side especially when you're down to the bottom of the frap it gets really foamy but eh, I don't mind that!  I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone seems to be to themselves but very friendly. A great place to study not too loud and pretty relaxing music. It's way better than Starbucks and if you're visiting in town like me I would definitely suggest this coffee place as a must stop by!",1
Coffee Shop 29,If you only have time for one bar or coffee shop in Austin.... Go here. Best mojito I've had in Austin. Also the amazing coffee goes great with the smores!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I love chocolate. I also love ice cream. And tea. And hot chocolate. Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet caramel. I really love caramel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about. The seating is sectioned off, there's pillows everywhere...",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been here multiple times, and I normally would give it five stars, except that parking is always insane, because this is on the corner of such a busy area!  Their food is great, and the drinks to me are just okay. What makes this place so cool is the atmosphere and the type of people that frequent here. You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of people all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea latte.  So, I always give special props and good reviews to those that have great service! The menu",1
Coffee Shop 29,Atmosphere is the best feature of this coffeeshop/bar.  I really like their latté and coffee in general,1
Coffee Shop 29,"6 check-ins Used to come here frequently in the summer to read and hang out while waiting for my bf to get off of work downtown. Definitely a cool place to chill if you can find the space. Seating is pretty limited and the place is normally filled with other people working. (which is probably a good sign otherwise) Always a lot of cool art on the walls. I normally would order the hazelnut frappe but have tried the different iced teas, thai iced tea and have gotten a salmon salad that was one of their specials and have tried other things off their menu. Food is always pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try drinks from the bar but in terms of my other drinks I've had slightly sloppy drinks made here and really really good ones depending on the barista. Tipping definitely will go a long way here..",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is the perfect spot for so many things: Great coffee, great food, great live music and GREAT breakfast tacos!!  Every Friday I pick up breakfast tacos for my office as an end-of-week treat and when I found out Halcyon was starting to serve breakfast tacos, I had to try them for myself. DELICIOUS! My office had a taste test with various vendors in downtown and Halcyon won, hands down.  As an added bonus, everyone at Halcyon is friendly and goes out of their way to make sure I'm happy. Mari and Jules are especially great and always greet me with a smile, making me feel like I'm entering into a friend's kitchen.  If I could give more than five stars, I would!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I've hated on Halcyon for a while. It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go downtown, but couldn't actually go downtown (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au lait's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"We were looking forward to a good happy hour vibe. However, drinks were mediocre and our bartender was grouchy, repeatedly yawning and laying her head on the bar, complaining about everything from the music to being at work. We probably won't return.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Coffee, tea, spirits, live music, art, people watching, and s'mores?! Cool place. Lots of seating. Open late. :)",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Beautiful coffee place with a great patio on the back! Hammocks and a very cool area to hang out while you drink one of their tasty coffees. We even had a pork bun from East Side King which is next to the café and it elevated the experience to another level. Yeah! Coffee and pork bun! Not the best combination when you think about it but totally worth it. Specially when it's happy hour and you have great stuff on the menu. Anyway, going back to the coffee shop, the staff is super nice and the place even nicer. Good prices and lots of options!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but my spouse partakes often, and we enjoy taking 30 minutes every now and again for a breakfast date after dropping our kiddo at school. Irie was a great find in the 04. The staff is friendly. The vanilla lattes are good. The other customers are friendly and the atmosphere is pretty cozy. Plus, they have Alma's breakfast tacos, which I love.  Parking can be an issue on the weekends, but during the weekday around 8:15 am, the neighboring businesses aren't yet open, so there is ample parking. You may run into issues if you need to turn left into commuter traffic to head north, however.  We've tried a lot of locally owned coffee places in the area and this is our favorite in South Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"In my decade of living in Austin, I can honestly say that this was my worst experience at a coffee shop. Indifference, rudeness, a lackadaisical attitude. These are the words that spring to mind.  To be clear, it happened a while ago. It's left a bad taste in my mouth ever since.",0
Coffee Shop 33,"My review is all about the hammocks in the backyard. I got a delicious soy latte and pretty much swung for an hour straight. Fantastic backyard set up, yummy drinks. I'll be hanging here whenever I get a chance to visit the southside.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"The 4 stars is for their hip outside seating area and the welcoming service we had here. The weather was perfect outside and there was plenty of shade. I can't say much about the food or coffee because I didn't try any of it. I really came here to read a book in a chill environment. For the most part it was relaxing to sit in the hammocks and read my book but I could hear some men working and clanking some things around (not so relaxing). But that obviously isn't the stores fault, there are other business very close by. I'll be returning, and trying some of their coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"3 check-ins This place is a great, locally-run establishment. All the workers are very friendly and it has that nice, neighborhood vibe. Coffee, beer, wine, and pastries/snacks are what you will find here.  The outdoor area is definitely where it's at. Hanging hammock chairs, tables, and an outdoor bar all make it a chill place to hang out. East Side King is right next door and will bring food over to you to eat here. Come and check out Open Mic on Thursday nights for a great rotation of local talent!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"3 check-ins I can't not do a review for this one.  I also can't about the food here (but I'm sure it's good) coz I didn't try any.  Patio + hammocks + stuff for kids to play with + bar + east side king as neighbors. What does that equate to? Do the math.  Patio = totally cool. Hammock = totally hipster. (Patio + hammock) = amazing.  Stuff for kids to play with = win. Bar = easy way for parents to relax while their kids play. (Stuff for kids to play with + bar) = win win.  East side king = great food. Service = A+.  Add it all up. What does it say??  Amazingly win win situation.  I docked off a star coz the margarita is kinda not very margarita like,and the restrooms remind me of public toilets in Miami beach. (No need to elaborate on that one. )  The best drink here is obviously the watermelon yum yum. It's freshly ground watermelon with moscato garnished with lemon. There's a lot of beers to choose from, they also have rotating. And of course, mimosas for you lovely ladies out there.  I like this place the way it is. Easy, friendly and not trying to be cool. That's what makes it so cool. Watermelon yum yum- watermelon with moscato Hammocks. What!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I have only been in the morning for coffee, but I enjoy the friendly staff, laid back atmosphere, and tasty coffee.  I will have to try it in the evening sometime!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Would i return - yes, most definitely.   I would get exactly what i got the first time - iced latte.      The hammocks out back were fun.  It was clearly a place where people liked to go and hang out.  Why not 5 stars - although the coffee was low acidity it didn't have the perfect balance of flavor; maybe too much milk?  Also, for the hot latte my husband got, the drink could have been bit hotter, i'm not talking super hot but lets just say closer to 140 degrees.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I was looking for a coffee shop with an outdoor patio close to home and found this place. Got an iced green tea which was great. They had a nice selection of gluten free pastries that looked good for next time. Inside of cafe is small, not much sitting room but outdoor patio is large. Lots of cigarette butts on floor of outside patio and dirty ashtrays on the benches which is why my review is lower. Ambiance was fun and hip so if they could just clean up the mess outside I would give a higher rating.",0
Coffee Shop 33,wow this coffee is so amazing like woah was not expecting it when i walked into this little place on accident it looks like a typical small average coffee shop but the taste is much better than anythig ive had around the area and great prices too!,1
Coffee Shop 33,"Best iced Mocha--ever! As a native Austinite (living in Miami now), I tried three different Austin-centric coffee shops when I was visiting a year ago and determined Irie had the best iced Mocha in town. I loved it so much, when visiting today I drove from north Austin in morning traffic just to have one. The super friendly folks making the drinks did not disappoint! Thanks for making my Monday that much more delightful.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Came here for the first time this past weekend for a Sunday date with my boyfriend. What a charming place! Reasonable prices, great selection. I got a pomegranate green iced tea and my BF got a triple shot of espresso. The tea was delicious and my BF is very particular about his espresso and he loved it. Also, the young lady that helped us out was very personable and pleasant to chat with! Great little coffee shop - will definitely return!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"3 check-ins Sweet and patient staff, always helpful and ready with ideas.  Cinnamon horchata with espresso. Can I say MORE please? Also got the juiceland pre-bottled ""recovery punch"" which is good for post hangovers.  Indoor seating is comfortable for a coffee shop, and the outdoor patio they share with East Side Kings is pretty cool with lots of trees and umbrellas for shade and plenty of tables.  Not sure about the wall outlet situation outside though.  My only complaint is that I've been in twice for the horchata espresso drink on the weekends and they've been out.  Not. Cool.  Homemade coffee horchata is not the same Entrance Drink case",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Listed in Kaffe The outside eating area is the neatest thing ever!  Plenty of picnic tables, funky art, and HAMMOCKS which was super exciting to discover!  The inside has really comfy seating and the baristas were super sweet.  My sister and I ordered espresso and it was one of the best ones in Austin, in our opinion.  It was a super relaxed place that made sure you felt welcome.  It also seemed like there were heaps of shops within walking distance which is nice.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure they have live events.  Definitely coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"This was our first & last visit at this coffee shop a couple days ago. We walked in and placed an order, everything was ok. Later on I went to get refills and had a hard time getting barista's attention, and when I finally did I had a hard time getting my questions answered because barista was too busy chatting with other customers who appeared to be her friends. I felt like I was interrupting their really ""important"" conversation by placing another order. Those customers weren't buying anything, they were just hanging out. Later on, the two of us were sitting in outdoor area still working, around 830pm, we were the only people outside. One of the ladies that works either at the coffee shop or the food place next door (they both share the same outdoor area) came by and very loudly stated ""I wish we could close now, since there are only two people out here"" to her co-worker. The guy knew it was inappropriate to say so he tried to smooth it out yet saying ""no, there are quite a few people inside too"". It was rude and absolutely unacceptable, especially when hours of operation are till 10pm. I sure don't ever plan on going back there. Either that lady needs to quit since she hates being there for two customers aka which is what she was hired to do, OR she needs to change her attitude towards customers. Needless to say all of their employees need to be trained on how to do a better customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 33,"This place has one of the best environments ever for a coffee shop. Indoors, the counter area is a cool wrap around bar, while high tables flank the walls, and there are a few lower tables. So, you can chill at the bar and talk to the friendly barista, get stuff done on your computer at high tables, or meet with a friend at table in the middle. I've done all three. Outdoors, there are picnic and other tables, some with umbrellas AND . . . wait for it . . . an awesome area with several hanging cloth chairs! They're in, like, a circle, so you can swing with one or several friends and while the day away, or have a casual meeting. Takes me back to my Caribbean days, but I digress. At night they have music, like Reggae Sundays, d.j.s and open mic nights, so night life is covered too. It's a real community type of place. So Irie has every kind of awesome drink: organic teas, iced or hot, delicious coffee and beer and wine. The one thing it lacks is a variety of food options. It has several high-quality (and expensive) bars and bagels, but no real food. But, you know, nothing in life is perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"The coolest part about this place was the backyard they have, with a bar. so this place is kind of like a mullet, business in front and party in the back.  Came by here after picking up my husband from the airport. It was finals week and needed a place to study. Since we were eating at East Side Kings we decided to check this place out. Cute little independent spot. Saturday afternoon studying. Uncomfortable chairs - till we moved to the cool facing recliners. I'd come back if I knew I could sit there! lol. Coffee was great, place was quiet except for one weird guy in the back laughing hysterically and talking to himself quite randomly.  At first I thought he was on the phone but then realized, nope, he wasn't. no phone, just his laptop. oh dear... but it is Austin after all. sooooo he fits right in! It's me that's not weird enough!!!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Super chill local coffee place. Quality wifi, very peaceful vibe, comfortable tall tables with readily available plugins for laptops, etc. It's clear there is a community spirit in this place with a very pleasant, go your own way kind of mood. Whether you're wanting, coffee, tea, beer or something more substantial, it's a great choice. With parking able to overflow into the Chipotle lot next door, you can get a spot, unlike many South Lamar locations. So, all in all, a great place to slow down, work a little, think a little, whatever. Try it. (p.s. you can congratulate me for not using the word ""mon"" or any fake Jamaican-inflected prose in the entire review. It was not easy.)",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I really liked this spot. I'll start off by saying that I did not have any of their coffee drinks, instead I opted for a Naked Juice that they had in a cooler full of drinks to choose from. My husband got their iced coffee, he enjoyed it. The atmosphere is why I'll come back to this shop though.. Inside is a small seating area, but their patio is awesome. They have several hammocks to sit in, along with an outside bar, lights, and some tables and chairs. Super calm vibe to just sit outside and talk with friends, study, or whatever you feel like doing.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I LOVED their iced latte, probably the best one. Their breakfast migas was also good. I love their backyard with hammocks, so COZY. I could stay there all day.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"First time going there and had a blast, everyone that worked there was really nice and awesome!!! Can't wait till I go back!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"2 check-ins Very friendly staff. The coffee bar really is a local bar. Four people were lined up with their laptops at the counter chatting with the barista bartender.  My smoothie was just Naked juice with ice, but that's what I get for ordering a smoothie at a coffee bar :/ Its a small coffee shop bit very Austiny Naked juice smoothie, zucchini bread and Bearded Brothers Mighty Maca Chocolate energy bar. Thats a mouthful.",1
Coffee Shop 33,I love it here. The owners go to my church so that's how I discovered this gem of a coffee shop (full disclosure) and you can tell locals are running the show. I can also say I see them give everyone the same stellar service I receive.  I highly recommend the surprisingly powerful iced coffee. Take a swing on the hammocks in the back. Free wifi.,1
Coffee Shop 33,"This hip little gem is my favorite coffee stop in Austin.  They have plenty of indoor seating, a bar area, friendly service and a super cool outdoor area to hang where I see a lot of people bringing their pups.    Like other reviewers said, parking can get tricky.  You have been warned.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I heart this place! I've been in Austin 11 days and I've stopped here more than any other place (4 times already and I found it on day 8!). Great coffee, great service, and fun ambiance!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Favorite iced Americano in Austin. Smooth, crisp and low acidity. The owner is super cool and they have tasty breakfast tacos in the morning. Large, clean and nice outdoor patio for large groups or outdoor eating.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I think the coffee here is really solid and so is the vibe. I like the outdoor area as well.  Unfortunately, I think the seating is super limited and it isn't a great place to sit down and get some work done.  In the summer it is simply to hot to fully enjoy the outside area.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"What they've done to the backyard in the past week is really awesome! They've now got shade, hammocks, christmas lights, etc. It's a great spot to go with your laptop, for coffee, or for a cocktail.  They've got a beer and wine license which they use to their full advantage. They've got a long list of ""wine cocktails"" that are really good! The bartender back there is really friendly too. He started a conversation with me that was so out of the blue and deep that for a second I thought he mistook me for another person, but my friends all had the same experience, so I guess he's just super friendly!  They also back up to East Side King's brick and mortar location so I'm sure everyone is super stoked about that!  Great spot. Highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I've been coming here since they first opened.  This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Austin.  Lots of positive vibes here, and plenty of fresh brewed deliciousness.    Parking can be a bit of an issue during primetime hours, but when you need a caffeine fix, it's not necessarily a hindrance.  If you go, say you know Raf...everyone else does!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"IT'S IRIE MAN! Located in swingin South Austin, the Bean has the most hip and laid back patio of any coffee bar in Austin.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but my husband enjoys the espresso while I sip on some delicious kombucha. We kick back and chill on the patio and take in some sun while enjoying some live music.  The patrons of the Bean are also super chill. It is nice to go hang out and people watch, study, or catch up with friends. I LOVE THE BEAN! My favorite kombucha at the Bean!",1
Coffee Shop 33,This place is growing on me.  I noticed there's a back patio.,1
Coffee Shop 33,Love the place- cool backyard. Sad the hammocks are gone when we went this past time. Like that it's next to a tattoo shop. I only give 4 starts because the baristas are a bit awkward and the parking is sucky if there full up with limited room. But good coffee and tea selections. Super helpful to fine what you like!,1
Coffee Shop 33,I literally spent most of my college years studying here. The staff are great to talk to. Awesome atmosphere. Family run. I can't say enough good things about the Irie Bean. When I'm just down and need a pick me up... I can stop in grab a coffee or a glass of wine and have great conversation with great people!,1
Coffee Shop 33,I love their cold brew! And can't wait from them to bring back the horchata latte! Not to mention they are always really nice and give good vibes.,1
Coffee Shop 33,"Listed in Coffee Thursday This was one of those places that you'd drive by and not know it was there or what it was. I will continue to drive by.  The atmosphere was just sort of..bleh. Not much seating inside (it looked like they had a large patio out back though, but I didn't check it out). I came in for a chat with a friend and a mocha and it was honestly worse than Starbucks coffee...like really yuck. Bummed me out since it's like the same price as Starbucks. Service wasn't insanely friendly either. Felt like I was bothering the guy. Meh, might have been me just being in a crazy good mood and not receiving that back.  Anyway, there are way better places for coffee around and I wouldn't recommend stopping into this place...but there was lots of parking!",0
Coffee Shop 33,"Chill relax wifi coffee my dog. Delicious pastries. Kind service, quick help with anything. I sometimes sit here for several hours by accident. The people are pretty rad.

Coffee Shop 33,"Items ordered: Double Espresso over Ice  Sugarbombed by Gourdough's and having walked a four mile stretch of 1st and Lamar while taking in the local galleries it came as no surprise that I found my caffeine gauge running on empty nearly two hours before dinner - my fuel soon found at Rasta themed Irie Bean Coffee Bar.  Apparently translating to ""the ultimate positive"" and committed to all things community, local, and fair trade with a committed local clientele it was just after 5:30 that I entered the cozy space and with reggae remixed Radiohead playing from above and utter hipster indifference from the barista my order was prepared - a hightop in the corner, free WiFi, and headphones playing actual Radiohead my entertainment for the next hour and a half.  Generally unfussed by disinterested service, particularly in the setting of well roasted beans the quality of that served at Irie, but in this case catching the occasional 'glare' from the bearded and spectacled young man behind the bar despite several empty seats suffice it to say that despite good espresso I most certainly did not find my ""irie"" at Irie, though I did find two things - the first a much needed pick-me-up...and that I still hate Reggae. See all photos from Michael U. for Irie Bean Coffee Bar",0
Coffee Shop 33,"Park here at 11:30, have a coffee, or a delicious chai. Maybe snack on a tasty taco. Not sure where they get theirs but the tortillas are rich.  Then kill time until ESK opens their doors. Bean and cheese taco + chai",1
Coffee Shop 33,"This cute little place is perfect for a study sessh bc the place is spacious, quiet and has wifi. However, I wouldn't recommend the coffee here.

Coffee Shop 33,"Having been to 6-7 coffee shops around Austin...I'm so in love with this place! Such a relaxed feel. I've had the pleasure of getting my coffee here for a few mornings and its been such a positive experience! The barista is incredibly sweet. I kind of have an obnoxious order - skinny vanilla latte iced sweetened with honey. Each time she has made it PERFECTLY. Also, the migas tacos + salsas are delicious! Will definitely be back!!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"My favorite for outdoor seating at a coffee shop. Some shade, outlets, free wifi, quiet, chill. If their seating could have cushions, I would work here everyday.

However...Irie Bean pulls off the Torani syrups rather well. I'm not sure what they do, but their coffee is impeccable. Flavorful and satisfying, with so many unique drinks. Like the mocha coconut for summer and the white chocolate pumpkin spice for the fall. You can't go wrong with coffee here whether it's hot or iced. Soon you'll be able to grab some coffee and grab a bite from East Side Kings next door (coming soon). You can bring your pooch, preferably when the weather is not sweltering hot, and sit outside under the shade trees to enjoy your coffee. From Comedy night to book night and music on their small outdoor stage, you can enjoy it all from Wednesday- Saturday nights. But wait there's more... sorry to sound like an infomercial, but come on you know it's catchy and it makes you listen every time. They serve beer and wine here! Irie Bean even has a daily HH from 4PM- 8PM. Don't forget about Yappy Hour on the last Friday of every month, starting at 7PM.

The prices are a little up there, comparable to Starbucks, so I was ready for a great cup of coffee.... Disappointed to say the least. The coffee was fair to spare-- but what I really didn't get was my small coffee was only half full... No one needs that much cream and sugar so I was confused. Gave it two stars because they had a sola feel and some cute baristas. Might go back for a beer in the pm's just to give it another shot.",0

I was disappointed to not find all the fixins that go with an iced tea. They had sugar, but no lemons or limes. There are plenty of outlets around to plug in to. The place was well kept, and clean. Except for the back, there was a huge dog turd in the middle of the back area. You know, it was right in front of the poop bag dispenser. What an inconsiderate pooch.",1

Coffee Shop 33,"I parked behind Irie and as I was walking up to it noticed all of the signs saying if you weren't a customer/resident you would get towed so I figured I'd ask the barista if I'd be ok once I found a seat inside. She quickly let me know I was better off moving it and that she'd watch my laptop for me. I know that is just common courtesy but I automatically got a good vibe from the place! Free wifi, plenty of seating although it is a small interior space and the coffee is great. Only complaint is the pricing! My small, no frills iced coffee was the price of a Venti iced coffee at Starbucks BUT the atmosphere, taste and quality should definitely be factored into that comparison :)",1
Coffee Shop 33,This is our go-to coffee bar in South Austin. The owner and staff are super friendly and they make an awesome hemp milk latte.,1

In the hot months they provide kiddie pools for the ahem, dogs to cool off in (darn, I know). --the coffee is really great.  Really great.  So.

Coffee Shop 33,Great place. Everyone is really friendly. It usually has a good mix of people socializing as well as studying.  A real neighborhood place. It has coffee and beer and wine. It had everything you need. The baristas are great and personable. There is even a really cool back patio that is under appreciated.,1
Coffee Shop 33,"Listed in Coffee Shops Another of my Austin favorite's!  Great atmosphere, friendly people.  A good vibe always...that's why it's Irie!  Yeah mon!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"I don't always drink coffee, but when I do, I prefer the Irie Bean.  Not good, but Great coffee, exceptional service, and exactly what a coffee place should be! Great for dog lovers that seek caffeine.  Shut up and take my money!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"Love, love Irie Bean! Such friendly staff and so many great options including almond, hemp and rice milks as well as beer and wine. Our son loves their almond milk hot chocolate. And don't be afraid to bring your laptop and enjoy their free wifi - no pressure to leave from these guys.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"2 check-ins Listed in Best drinking (coffee and/or adult) Irie Bean Coffee Bar  A relatively new place in my rotating selection of coffee houses.  This place gets mad props for several reasons:  open mic nights, coffee AND beer, super pet friendly.  And super helpful (and cute) counter staff.  The seating area inside isn't the largest or roomiest but the backyard more than makes up for it.  Like the vibe of Fair Bean-maybe not the coffee house vibe for everyone-but a breath of fresh air for those of us tired of pretentious cups of joe.  4 out of 5 stars and I can't wait to go back.  Try the Guiness/Espresso beverage (forget what it is called, ""Irie Bomb"" maybe...but MAN is it GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) the breakfast of champions!",1
Coffee Shop 33,Listed in Give me coffee or give me death! It's small and intimate. Also they have really good coffee. I went there for a lunch break and I regret not going outside to the patio. I had a coffee and bagel for lunch. It had a great atmosphere and I shall be back soon so I can write more about this place.,1
Coffee Shop 33,"Apparently people think you can only staff and serve native islanders here because it's Caribbean themed(see Charlie M). But fear not, there are other people who enjoy a laid back setting, very friendly staff, and reggae music too! The barista even made me a custom frappe when I wanted horchata in smoothie form. Oh, and they have a back patio and beer, mmmmm.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"The Irie Bean is a favorite hangout of ours with a happy neighborhood vibe and lots of ""regulars"" who are fun to talk with. It's totally kid friendly, dog friendly and well, just all around friendly! The coffee is local and the beer selection is also great, and they host a lot of fun events too.  The indoor part of Irie Bean is cozy with plenty of seating and is great for work/study sessions with music at just the right level to blend with and drown out the steady hum of conversations, but not distract you from your work.  But don't miss the patio, which is much larger than the inside of the coffee shop. Some people don't even look out the back door and they are missing out. They have tons of tables and seating, it's somewhat landscaped and they have a stage and a fun rocket ship sculpture that is so tall you can walk right through it. Kids love it and can draw on the inside with chalk. People bring their dogs.  My only complaint is the smokers, especially because they all sit and congregate right around the door going in/out of the coffee shop so there's no way to avoid them. I wish they wouldn't allow smoking out there or at least would limit it to an area that is set apart from where people have to walk to go in or out.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"This is one cool study spot. With multiple seating options and wonderful staff, I think I've just found a little piece of heaven. Alissa helped me and made me feel right at home. Plenty of outlets make this a laptop friendly place. I didn't try the food, but there were many who stopped in for lunch. The TV kept me updated on news and the music list was unobtrusive, but I caught my foot tapping several times. Super nice place and I highly recommend it.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"IBCB has sort of a unique vibe, even for SoLa--I often write these reviews in hopes that I might find an opportunity to use the hip lingo. The handful of shops, eateries, and hangouts along this strip of the street provides the perfect backdrop for this caffeine-and-music-driven establishment.  The clientele is all over the place: there were hipsters next to some old people next to some little kids! Certainly a very community feel here.  The solid fare and refreshing or stimulatory beverages are as expected: local, simple, and well-selected. My cup of joe was pretty good. They keep the prices low here, also.  I understand that this post has just been a bunch of rambling. And it is very unoriginal, to boot. But... with so many Austin coffee joints under my belt, there is not much I can say but: this: go. drink. enjoy.",1

Coffee Shop 33,"I love the quinoa and sweet potato griddle cakes.  They are so yummy.  Again, I only visited this place because my boyfriend loves reggae, coffee and Caribbean food.  Apparently he has a built in GPS for such things, since I drive up and down South Lamar frequently and I only notice the Mexican restaurants.    The service was great and the staff was very friendly.  I hope they do not decide to build a second location as in my experience, when a ultra-cool place does this it loses mojo.",1
Coffee Shop 33,"The very sweet girl working today whipped up an amazing blended coffee drink for me. The indoor seating area is pretty limited, pefect if you are alone and studying for example. The outdoor seating area is also perfect if you need to bury your head in textbooks or your laptop but also great if you are with a group. Happy hour 4-8pm!",1

Coffee Shop 33,"A strange location and a strange place.  I am a coffee shop kinda girl and I just didn't feel comfortable here at all.  I had to wait in line a long time while the barista chatted with the person ahead of me.  I had nowhere to be so I didn't mind a delay, but I swear it must have been five minutes before she decided to hold the conversation and take my order.  It was really bordering on the ridiculous.  Then the coffee wasn't very good and the seating is weird and... just not a good experience.",0
Coffee Shop 33,"Want great coffee at a community coffee shop? This is your place! Raf, the owner, is usually there to welcome you. The staff is friendly and their barista skills are masterful. The taco shop next door (Casita Tacos) will deliver your breakfast taco to you while you enjoy your coffee.  Feel like a jerk? After 5pm on Thursday - Sunday, they have amazing Caribbean food, like jerk chicken, fish tacos (best I've had in Austin), pulled pork sliders and Quinoa & sweet potato griddle cakes (vegan).  They regularly hold events like Yappy hour for the dogs, open mic night for the sub-humans and outdoor musical acts for everyone else.  Don't miss the Irie Bean!",1
Coffee Shop 33,"What a pleasant place! I don't have internet at the new pad just yet so had to toddle on over here for homework and yelping related purposes.  The barista made me a ""London Fog"" (miss you, Coffee Pot) that wasn't on the menu but I described and he obliged. Thank you.  I even ventured for a pistachio muffin. Yes, it had green food dye. No, I don't care because it was tasty. They don't have a huge food selection but that's cool because this place seems to be more coffee and tea focused.  And I'm totally enjoying eavesdropping onto people's convos in a non-creepy way. Lots of Austinites in and out. And I'm finally one of them (sort of)! People seem to truly be coming here to do stuff. Not just hanging out to be seen typing away at their laptops (*clear throat* youtube.com/watch?v=12JT…).  Last plus, good music!  Everything from Dean Martin to Marvin Gaye to some emo stuff.

Coffee Shop 33,"The Irie Bean is a gem. The atmosphere and decor are very relaxed, and the baristas and regulars are all very friendly.  I always get their cold-brewed coffee, which keeps the tasty coffee flavors and caffeine without the acidic bite. The food is average cafe food, with a couple of cool things, like the pistachio muffin (tastier than it sounds). Also, they've got beer, board games, and a dog-friendly back patio!  This cafe earns it'as 5 stars.",1

Coffee Shop 33,"5 check-ins Simply put, I feel welcome here. The coffee's great and I've already befriended the entirety of their barista staff. I spend hours here on accident. Only problem is that it can get crowded due to it's limited seating. But why not used the crammed situation for a reason to start conversation? it's worked for me on numerous occasions here. A great place for folk new to town like myself.",1
Coffee Shop 56,To the point review...  1. YUM 2. Authentic 3. Cheap 4. Great atmosphere 5. Smoke Salmon Toast is my favorite!,1
Coffee Shop 56,"I am constantly amazed at how many gems there are in East Austin, and Sa-Ten is definitely among those finds.  I was at a meeting over at the Millenium Entertainment Complex and wanted to try something different. I put lunch in the search and this place popped up. It is located in the Canopy complex off Springdale which is an old warehouse converted into mostly art studios and galleries.  Although they are billed as a Japanese restaurant, the interior has more of a quaint coffee house vibe with cool retro touches including a circa 1960's console TV converted into a fish tank.  The place was bustling with people. As I was looking at the lunch menu at the choices of lunch plates and Sa-Tén Toast, I asked the woman at the counter what she suggested, and she recommended the Yakitori Rice Bowl ($10). Sold!  The yakitori rice bowl came with three skewers of marinated broiled chicken thighs, served over a bed of steamed rice with kale and negi onion, seasoned with sanshi pepper and Shichimi. The chicken was topped with a cilantro sauce and garnished with beni shoga ginger, Kewpie mayo, and a soft cooked onsen egg. The chicken was moist, and I loved all the flavor combinations with the soft yolk of the egg mixed into the rice bowl.  Sa-Tén has breakfast, lunch, dinner and all day menus. They are known for their Sa-Tén Toasts, which are on thick Texas toast bread with different combinations. Their garlic anchovy toast is served with many of the entrees.  Their prices are reasonable. For breakfast, they offer sandwiches and toasts from the $5-$7.50 range. Lunch has most entrees at $10 with toasts from $6-$10. Dinner entrees range from $9-$14. The Daily Menu has smaller bites, sides, toasts and sandwiches from $2-$7.50. The food is fresh and made to order. The service is fast and friendly.  If you find yourself in East Austin and are looking for something off the beaten path and different with a Japanese flair, I recommend you give Sa-Tén a try. You won't be disappointed. Yakatori Rice Bowl",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Was here at 9+am on Sunday and the place was still quite quiet. Had a cup of americano and shared the sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast & yasai toast with 2 friends for breakfast. Since these were served on thick toasts, our order was sufficient to fill us up. I enjoyed both toasts but I would pick the yasai toast if I had to pick one!  It wasn't lunch time yet when we were there, but the lunch menu was made available to our friends. We tried the chicken katsu curry they ordered, and were impressed by the panko fried chicken thigh. The curry was tasty though I think it could have been a bit spicier.  Just a minor grouse: the menu stated that the yasai toast came with asparagus, broccoli, okra, bell pepper, tomato, Kewpie mayo, anchovy garlic oil, mozzarella cheese... But I don't remember getting any bell pepper or okra on ours. Sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast and yasai toast",1
Coffee Shop 56,"This place can be a bit difficult to find if you're an out-of-towner like myself.  I was using google maps on my phone and passed up Sa-Ten a couple times.  Mainly because the front of the building looks like a Warehouse.  Sa-Ten is nested behind the back along with a few other establishments that appears to be galleries.  I drove to ATX from Houston that day for some Franklin's BBQ.  As stuffed as I was, I wanted to stop by Sa-Ten to try their Salmon Toast.  My order came out a tad burnt on the edges but O M G, that was one delicious piece of toast I tell ya!  Why doesn't any Houston establishments offer this?  Let's get with it H-Town!    I also ordered a cup of their house specialty - the Ohayo (brown sugar cappuccino).  Nothing mind blowing about it.  I'd probably try something different on my next visit.  Best part of Sa-Ten?  It's located in the perfect part of town.  Along the way out back to Houston if you're taking 71. lol  I would totally come back here.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Our friends told us about this place and convinced us to try it. We're glad they did because the food here is delicious! We ordered the Chicken Katsu Plate with kale salad and curry, and the Smoked Salmon Toast.  The Smoked Salmon Toast came with small pieces of salmon on top of a sriracha mayo sauce on brick toast. Pretty pricey at $7.50 for the portion size but yummy indeed.  The Chicken Katsu Plate was probably one of the best katsu we've ever had. The chicken pieces were tender, perfectly seasoned, and had a very crispy coating. The kale salad pairing was very refreshing, and had a unique lemon-y dressing. Even the rice was sprinkled with some type of seasoning that complemented the katsu.  Definitely coming back here in the future to fill our tummies with more yummys! Chicken Katsu Plate with kale salad, rice, and curry",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Great drinks and awesome atmosphere. It's a cool cafe&eatery with cute Japanese accents. :)  Good for studying, hanging out, and dining. There's also plenty of parking space so that's a plus. Check it out. Almond milk latte was fantastic",1
Coffee Shop 56,"2 check-ins Sa-Ten is great for a casual meal, working from a coffee shop or just hanging out and reading a book.    Their lattes are to die for (they always have a special of the month and they make the syrup and other toppings from scratch there).    Try out any of their toasts and chicken katsu.  Potato wedges with their green chutney will have you coming back for more.    If you're wanting something on the lighter side, indulge in the Sa-Ten salad.  It's so fresh, colorful and seasonal.  Everyone seems to go in and order the Ohayo (I've never had it since it has condensed milk), but in a normal sitting, I'll see at least 10 people order it so it must be good.    They have almond milk for those of you who don't drink dairy.  And they have plenty of juices from juiceland and topochico's to quench your thirst! Yakitori bowl. Nori tama lunch plate.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I love Sa-Ten more than most Austin coffee shops because of the large parking lot, quiet and calm atmosphere, fairly cheap prices, and GREAT Japanese food.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Walk in... Dead silent.  You feel uncomfortable talking because everyone is just so. quiet.  Once you move past that though, the food is really yummy. Great snackage/small meals.  I got the Mac salad, chicken katsu and potato salad. Such a nice filling-enough lunch...  It was sort of hard to find as a driver in a strange city but my brother spotted it as we passed by.  I can see this being the perfect study spot.  Noticed some games in a corner and some manga in the other. Cute! See all photos from Ruby D. for Sa-Ten",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Listed in Weekend in Austin A nice little Japanese coffee house tucked inside an almost factory looking building. Sa-Ten takes the quirkiness of Austin, removes the rowdy crowd and the claustrophobic atmosphere we've grown accustomed to in any downtown establishments, and adds a traditional Japanese flavor into the mix. Excellent place to catch up with friends and to chill in general.  Their specialty here is their giant toasts. We tried out the Chicken Katsu (on rice and toast), the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast, and the Egg, Bacon, and Sausage Toast, all of which were excellent. The toasts were soft and buttery with the ingredients melted on top with cheese. Bonus points for managing to season the toast properly without making them soggy. Simply put, their toasts completely redefined my perception of what a toast dish should look like. They also have 4 sides to go along with the toasts and you can't go wrong with any of them. If you're getting one of the savory toasts, I recommend getting the curry as one of the sides and use it as a dipping sauce. Yum! The portion sizes of the dishes are moderate so don't expect to eat a big heavy meal here.  The place is clean and well-maintained. In addition to the food, they also have a few board games and some authentic Japanese comic books. Again, great environment for a meet up or a date. We would certainly come back more to try out their drinks or just to do some work. Plenty of sitting area. Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I've been here a couple times and think it's a great, out of the way location to study or have lunch. Usually, Sa-Ten is pretty deserted since it's tucked away in one of the more remote locations of Austin. The interior has a great homey feeling and there are a couple outlets so you can plug in and study away.  I think the food is pretty good -- a little overpriced, but still decent. I've gotten the lemonade and it's definitely fresh squeezed and very tart, so take advantage of the agave syrup they have next to the utensils and other condiments. Their toasts also make for a great snack and usually come with a side of curry for dipping.  Most recently I went during the East Austin Studio Tour and they had altered their menu and put everything in disposable paper ware with smaller portions, so I wouldn't recommend going whenever it's crowded, service and food will suffer because of it.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Sa-Ten is a hidden gem of East Austin. The food here is amazing. I can't get enough of it. I usually get the Chicken Katsu Plate, which is incredibly filling and delicious. My wife always gets the same thing the Ebi Fries with the Garlic Anchovy Toast. I also highly recommend if you're in the mood for coffee, getting the Ohayo--a brown sugar cappuccino with breve.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Sa-Ten is a, ""Japanese influenced coffee shop specializing espresso drinks and teas along with local pastries, and Japanese coffee shop style food items."" I just wanted to say how great it is they are located at Canopy, a development with multiple artist studios and shops. When you are in that area of East Austin, there aren't many quality coffee shops. I also like that they sell healthy natural fruit and nut bars. Sometimes I am ""on the go"" and I just need a little pick-me-up.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I got the chicken katsu, with anchovy toast, kale salad, and curry.  The curry had radishes in it and was so fresh.  The kale salad was lemony and perfect.  The chicken was moist and crispy.  I called in the order to go and the person on the phone said it would be 10 minutes.  25 minutes later, I got my food.  After asking after it twice.  Maybe not the best place for quick, but it is for good food.  I had already had my coffee, but it smelled like good caffeine in there, so next time...",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I have been wanting to try Sa-Ten (I always want to say the name the wrong way) and finally got the chance when I had a training near by! I was definitely not disappointed. I strictly went for the food, but I heard their drinks are just as great!  Food was fresh and for the amount you get, totally worth the $10. I give the Chicken Katsu plate a 8/10. It comes with rice and 2 sides. I got curry and macaroni salad, but I honestly should have ordered 2 sides of curry because it's so darn good! I've been looking for a place that has authentic Japanese curry and Sa-Ten is the closest to my experience in Vegas. The only thing that would have made this plate a 10/10 was that the chicken was a little on the dry side. Other than that, the plate itself was delightful!  I'll definitely be back again to eat their Chicken Katsu and curry! This plate is a little heavy, so you might want a coffee to wake you up from the afternoon slumps :p Chicken Katsu with curry and macaroni salad",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Atmosphere/ Location: Located behind a warehouse looking building. It was hard to find but we eventually got there! The lights inside are pretty dim and there's outdoor seating available.  Food: The food was a lot better than I expected. For the price, they really give you what you ordered. But the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast didn't live up to the hype.. it tasted a bit fishy and dry. But I'll give it a try again next time. I got the honey ginger pork dish with the rice which was super flavorful. I enjoyed every bite although the dish got cold pretty fast. The girl behind the counter recommended I do the toast instead of the rice with my dish- I wish I had tried the toast instead. The rice came out pretty but it was just a lot of rice. My friend got the Chicken Katsu Curry and she loved it also. It looked pretty soupy and warm!  Service: The service is pretty fast and they bring the food to you. The water dispenser is located on the side of the store so you can easily help yourself also! Like I said, the girl behind the counter was kind and made recommendations to the first-timers.  Time: The food came out relatively fast for the amount of food we got. I was pretty impressed.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I really love Sa-Ten, from the atmosphere, to the decor, to the food, to the drinks. I came on a Saturday morning for brunch around 11. It was quiet and it just felt really chill and relaxed. There were some people eating and chatting, some people drinking coffee and studying, some people just picking up drinks to go. You order at the counter and pay there before you get the food.  We were there for the lunch menu, and I got to try the chicken katsu, smoked salmon toast, and nori-tama toast. Everything was delicious!! The chicken katsu was tender and juicy, with a nice crunch, but it didn't feel too oily. The sides were yummy too- I liked the potato salad and the macaroni salad the most, but the kale salad was good for an acidic kick to break up the creaminess of the other sides. I also really liked the rice, which is super important in Japanese food!  The smoked salmon toast and nori-tama toast were also delicious. They use thick cut Japanese style toast, and the crunchy/soft texture of the bread worked perfectly with the creamy toppings. I want to try the me so honey toast next time too!  I also tried the coconut matcha latte and the matcha chai latte, which were both delicious and not too sweet.  Another plus- parking is ample :). Even though the atmosphere here is distinctly Austin, the food is authentically Japanese, and the combination is a definite win in my book!

Coffee Shop 56,"Lunch specials is where it's at.  Chicken katsu curry and karage are both filling.  Mac or kale salad are both good. I think the breakfast stuff can be overpriced.  I like that this place has plenty of parking and that it's pretty quiet.  Quiet, friendly and low key.  I hope the hip and trendy people stay away and go to Thunderbird and all.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"What an interesting little coffee shop! The boyfriend and I discovered Sa-Ten while traveling from Houston to Hamilton Pool. We just wanted a light (and delicious) breakfast and this place did not disappoint!  Sa-Ten is tucked away in what seems to be former truck loading docks so it is pretty easy to miss. Once inside the cafe it's really hard to not notice how gorgeous the whole place is. The wood accents, large windows to allow sunlight to come in, and little antique features all come together to give out this hipster (but not pretentious) vibe that just feels so warm and peaceful. The antique TV converted into a fish tank is a cute little feature. It seems like a great place to study or relax and read a book, but not sure how this place gets when it's not a Monday morning.  As for the food - Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon toast (5/5): I'm not a big fan of fish, especially when it's barely cooked like smoked salmon, but I enjoyed this dish. The sriracha mayo is lost in the fish, but i'm sure that without that and the mozzarella cheese then this dish would have been way more fishy. The bottom of the toast was burnt, but I could barely taste it.  Nori Tama toast (5/5) - This dish was so delicious! The egg spread was light and had a distinct mayo taste to it, but it was very delicious. Who would of thought that egg spread, mozzarella cheese, and seaweed would blend so well together? My boyfriend has officially made this a staple for his future visits to Austin.  Overall, little coffee shops like this are hidden gems that should be discovered by everyone! Nori Tama (top) & Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon (bottom)",1
Coffee Shop 56,"This place has so much aesthetic dimension that you/ll want to take instagram pictures of the entire cafe. It's modern and full of rustic accents everywhere, and you'll find people here studying / eating / quietly chatting away. I find it a bit too cold for hardcore studying, but it's a great place to catch up on some reading or write papers. Most of the lighting is natural, so it's definitely bright enough to work on your homework, but I find that the air conditioning is a bit too chilly if you plan to stay for several hours (my boyfriend and I both ended up catching a cold from staying here for 4 hours, oops). One downside for me is that the chairs are metal and either don't have back support (stools) or have bad back support (not the best thing to lay back on for too long) TL;DR: if you're not picky on chairs and can tolerate a cooler environment, this place is a great place to study.  As for the food, I think it's decently good. The portions aren't large, but they should fill you up enough if you aren't starving. The value and quality of the food don't really justify the prices, so I don't come too often for the food's sake. But from time to time, I find myself coming back when I'm looking for the perfect hipstery cafe that has above average ""cafe food"". If you're really hungry or craving a really scrumptious meal, Sa-Ten isn't what you're looking for. The chicken katsu is a little dry, the salmon toast is yummy but the salmon sometimes can be so itty-bitty, and the rice feels more as a little side rather than a filler. The drinks are solid but overpriced as well.  I don't mean to sound like a harsh critic, because I really do enjoy going to Sa-Ten. If you're willing to spend a bit of money, you'll have a great time at a neat little place in Austin that's great for studying and/or snacking with friends. I think that for the atmosphere and the type of food you can get at a cafe, Sa-Ten does a good job.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Can't speak for the drinks but service was quick and friendly, and the lunch was delicious.  I had a delightful chicken katsu with macaroni salad and curry as sides.  Only minor critiques would be that the curry could be spicier, I like some heat, and the macaroni salad was a tiny bit dry.  Would totally come back again! Chicken katsu with macaroni salad and curry as sides.",1
Coffee Shop 56,I wish this place wasn't in the middle of no where in East Austin... literally so far away from campus.  This is my go to spot for the Japanese katsu curry and kale salads! I'm usually not a kale person but their kale is SO GOOD!  Japanese katsu curry: 4/5 - the curry is pretty good and katsu itself is delicious. Kale salad - they use a lemon vinaigrette that tones down the flavor of the bitter kale.  The place gets busy during finals because I guess people like studying here since it's so lonely and quiet. katsu curry,1
Coffee Shop 56,"Listed in Affordable, but Quality Brunches in Austin, Cutest Cafes in Austin The combination of coffee, brunch, and Japanese is unexpectedly genius. Not only that, but the environment is comfortable for studying, lunch or coffee with a friend, or to play the board games they have available to customers. For me the distinguishing factor about Sa Ten is that it satisfies this variety of cravings.  I tried a latte and salmon toast - not the best combination I will say, but both individually tasted great. The salmon toast is savory and has a good spicy kick to it that adds a lot of flavor. The latte isn't the best I have had but it's good enough to make me return here.  The location feels kind of remote or out of the way but that is one of the nice things about Sa Ten - it really gives off that hidden, secluded vibe that is refreshing when you live in such a big, busy city.  There are endless outlets for studying, and free wifi, so I can imagine spending a day studying or catching up on work here.  For the Instagrammers, this place is also perfect for those overhead food pics.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"UM YUM! I'm so glad I found this place while I was at emancipet. First time I came in I just had their iced lavender honey latte and it was good. Wasn't OMG DELICIOUS but pretty tasty. I was more impressed with the location and the ambience of the place.  Looks like a great place to get work done. Always seems really quiet and multiple people getting busy on their laptops. I also really love how it's across buildings from art galleries. A hidden gem. Seems like a cute date spot.  So when I finally came back, I had their chicken katsu and it was DELICIOUS. Perfectly crispy yet the meat was still tender. Really enjoyed the sauces on top as well (BBQ and something?) AND the cute square shaped rice with purple stuff on top. Yum. The worker that took my order recommended the kale salad and macaroni for sides but I went with the macaroni and potato salad. Both solid choices. This time I also tried the special matcha latte with the lavender honey syrup (recommended by the worker) and it was alright. Not very sweet and had a lot of powder on the bottom that made my teeth green.  I will definitely come back for the food but the only downside I see is the place itself being really quiet. I came here with friends and we felt obligated to eat outside since it's such a study environment. We also came pretty late in the afternoon so maybe during normal lunch hours more people are eating and less studying? Not sure, guess I'll have to come back soon :)  All in all I think the drinks are ok but the food is a 5/5. I need to come back and try the toasts! DELICIOUS Chicken Katsu with macaroni and potato salad sides. Iced matcha latte, in the corner, with the special lavender honey syrup!",1
Coffee Shop 56,"First off, the ""Ohloha"" or whatever the brown sugar latte is.. best latte I've ever had! I asked for a little less sweetener and it was perfect. I also had the egg toast, Nori, it was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Really enjoyed this place :)  I was in town for a weekend conference and saw that I had Sa-Ten bookmarked from a while ago. Decided to skip an afternoon meeting and head here for a snack. Really cool location - hipster for sure haha. Vibe was great though, with lots of open seating (indoors and outdoors), large windows, and a bright airy feel.  Ordered: - ohayo latte, a brown sugar cappuccino. Very milky and lightly sweetened. - chicken katsu plate with kale salad, rice, and macaroni salad. Really interesting sauces on the chicken katsu: Worcestershire sauce and tar-tar sauce? All the flavors were great though and it was really filling for the price.  My total was ~$16 which for the amount of food, was a great value. I would try a different coffee next time; maybe another house specialty! Chicken Katsu plate and Ohayo Latte",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Yes, Sa-Ten! This is a shop to checkout in East Austin! Here's why:  +lunch and dinner is served at this charming coffee shop. I like the high and low seating areas and the cute aquarium! +Japanese curry is served as a side option - I loved it with the lightly seasoned white rice! +Chicken Katsu is made well +macaroni salad is refreshing; especially loved the slices of apples inside! +quiet environment with good lighting; perfect place to get work done during the day!  I'll have a repeat visit sure enough!",1
Coffee Shop 56,"This place lives up to its hype! I think it's interesting how this cafe is kind of in the middle of a random isolated area. There's an art gallery across from it and the whole areas just gives off a very artsy, calm, and hipster vibe.    I went there for lunch last Friday and it was really good. I got the sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast lunch plate with the kale salad and Fuji macaroni salad. And I believe my friend got the chicken teriyaki one. I thought the presentation of the plate was super cute and simple.  The toast was thick and soft, and the sriracha mayo was creamy, but without being overbearing. The smoked salmon pieces were pretty good too. I can see why everyone likes their toast so much! I also really loved the two sides a lot! Usually restaurants will drown their salads with dressing and have a ton of mayo in their macaroni salads, but Sa-ten does it super minimalistic. It felt so clean and healthy while I was eating them. The Fuji macaroni salad was on point. I tried a little of my friend's chicken teriyaki and while it was good, it was a bit dry? I feel like there could've been more sauce put on it.  When the food first came out, I thought that I wouldn't be full at all. But it's surprisingly more filling than you'd think it'd be. I left super satisfied and happy! Definitely will go back to try some of their other things like the chicken katsu sandwich which looks really good in the pictures I've seen on Yelp.

Coffee Shop 56,"2 check-ins This place would have been an amazing spot to study at if I were still at college. A short 10 minute drive from campus, this place is hidden next to what seems like an art gallery.  Usually, coffee shops serve the usual pastries and bagels, but never had I had the pleasure of amazing food and amazing coffee. I got the Chicken Katsu, the salmon toast, and an ohayo drink.  The Katsu came with two sides, I chose curry and macaroni salad. The curry was very tasty, but I feel like there wasn't enough rice for both the Katsu and the curry. I ended up dipping some of my Katsu in the curry which was a good combination.  The salmon toast was also terrific, and everyone I know always Instagrams pictures of this. It was well worth the hype as it was AMAZING.  The coffee was slightly bitter and full flavored. Delicious coffee. If you want something sweeter go for the iced saifa.  I'm coming back here for more for sure. Strawberry toast with marscapone cheese. A+",1

Coffee Shop 56,"Coolness on a stick!  Modern industrial architecture surrounded by art galleries in every direction.  GOOD coffee.  Their custom drinks lean heavily on brown sugar, like brown sugar in a Vietnamese Iced coffee and brown sugar in a short espresso.  What's not to like about that?  Decent solid food.  Not a destination dinner but great ""study"" fare.  Good cold katsu sandwiches.  Messy yummy egg salad sandwiches.  (My co-eater put in a silent protest about the quality of the egg salad sandwich.  I got to eat hers and was happy to do so.)  LOTS  OF PLAIN GRILLED VEGETABLE SIDES.  How often do you get to drink a good latte, munch on freshly grilled asparagus, and work on your computer in a cool industrial room with lots of natural light?  And with all the art and sculpture in the neighboring galleries,  you can pretend to be cutting edge  even if all you are doing on your computer is reading Taylor Swift's personal grooming tips.  Still, with all the graphic excellence and next wave sensibility all around you,  you probably want to bring up your game to the next level.  Bring your Louise Gluck or Suji Kim,  put Glenn Branca or Charming Hostess on your headset,  and stick some experimental films on your computer as background while you read.  Life is good.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Wow!  Sa-Ten was a pleasant little surprise.  I came for some coffee and left stuffed from the food.  First off, this coffee shop\eatery is in a cool location next to some art galleries in buildings that were once warehouses?  The parking is actually what used to be the truck loading docks.  It looks like the area is still being built out and leased so it will probably only get better although possibly more crowded.   So we started off ordering our coffee drinks.  I had to go with the house specialty Ohayo and a Mocha.  The Mocha was a tiny bit sweet for my taste, but if you like the sweetened Starbucks type coffee drinks you will like the Mocha here.  More for those that have their sweetener with a splash of coffee.  The Ohayo was good though. Next the food.  Chicken teriyaki kara-age, Nori Tama Toast, and a honey butter toast with a side of potato salad and kale salad.  I'm not usually a huge fan of potato salad, but this potato salad was creamy and quite a treat.  It reminded me of a mix between potato salad and mashed potatoes.  There was no overpowering taste of Mayo and no raw large chunks of potato like some potato salads have.  The Kale Salad had a nice vinaigrette over it.  The chicken kara-age was tender on the inside with a crunchy batter on the outside.  Teriyaki sauce drizzled on the outside.  Decent size portion of Chicken for $6.  The Nori Tama was like having a deviled egg on top of a piece of toast with cheese.  It sounds a little weird and possibly unappetizing, but trust me, it all comes together. The honey butter toast, I don't know if this is supposed to be considered a dessert or snack, but either way, it was amazing.  My wife found that dipping this in the coffee hit the spot for her.  I thought just eating it straight up was tasty.  I don't think it matters how you eat it, you're going to like it. A lot of people seem to come here to grab a snack and a coffee and work on their laptops which is cool.  The one thing I'll say is seating is somewhat limited and tables are basically able to fit 2 people.  There were a couple of people in there that were by themselves and using the other chair at the table for their backpacks which I found a bit inconsiderate when they see people looking around for chairs (some tables had 1 chair only so if people would put their backpack on the floor someone else could use the other chair to actually sit in at another table).   There is bar seating around with the same thing going on there.  A lot of single people sitting in the bar stools every other spot leaving only 1 spot in between.  As the place starts getting busy, have some consideration and move over where there is at least 2 stools in between you and the next person!

I don't make it down/over here often, but it's Spring Break and my precious snowflake is attending spider monkey camp at nearby Austin Bouldering Project. I counted this as a perfect opportunity to start attacking my bloated Bookmarked list of awesomeness east of IH35. Mission #1: lunch at Sa-Ten.  Even though it's practically across the street from the gym, I had a bit of a hard time finding the place. You turn into this sort of industrial looking warehouse complex with a couple of art galleries & little shops, head around to the very back and left, and there you see the actual windows and entrance for the shop. It's styled in that very popular rustic contemporary kitch vibe, which might annoy me a bit except it's just so pleasant inside. Not too crowded, free wifi, plenty of indoor & outdoor seating, books & games to play, friendly staff. If I lived nearby, I'd probably be here every day.  Let me just get this out of the way. BEST COFFEE EVER! My cafe au lait was a revelation. Apparently, local bean supplier Casa Brasil has made a pact with Beelzebub to come up with the most delicious beans roasted in the most perfect way to be expertly brewed by Sa-Ten and paired with cow juices. Good lord, I'm having special feelings just remembering that cup.  I tried the lunch special salmon toast with curry sauce for dipping and a kale salad as my strengthening meal before a grueling afternoon at SXSW free shows. Yeah, the salmon is a bit strong tasting, but I didn't mind at all and ate every morsel of the toast & curry. The kale salad would have been fine if I'd had more time for chewing, but the music was calling and I had to run.  The coffee had me fiending and returned again the next day for another fix. The place was empty at 8am on a Friday morning. If you're one of those lucky work-from-anywhere types, this could be your sweet spot.",1
Coffee Shop 56,2 check-ins Cute cafe/restaurant. It's tucked away behind a building but you should have no problem in finding it. I liked the atmosphere of Sa-Ten. It was quiet and cozy. Since it's a cafe and a restaurant I could probably stay & study there forever (just kidding but it is nice). I got the chicken tonkatsu with a side of rice and potato salad. The sides were kinda expensive ($2 for rice???) The portion size was average and I did enjoy the tonkatsu sauce. They also have some selection of games which is cool.

Coffee Shop 56,"So lucky to have this cafe / eatery in my neighborhood. This is a go to spot that always offers, fresh, delicious eats that are very flavorful. My go to is the kale salad with chicken or the Katsu with rice, curry, and grilled veggies. So super yum. I wish the coffee was a bit less dark / bitter, but I do like the macchiato set. They used to give you a Hershey's kiss with the set but not anymore. Sad face.  Also, depending on how much of an ""Austin is over"" mood I'm in, it can be either humorous or soul-sucking to overhear conversations from developers about the next historic house they'll tear down to build the next best restaurant. I swear to God - EVERY TIME.  This is not Sa-Ten's fault that their clientele is typically of the rich California developer set, but it does affect the ""ambience"" per se.  P.S. My daughter loves the aquarium and squirrel wallpaper so much.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"One of the nicer coffee houses/cafes I've ever been too. The atmosphere is a little hipster/rustic and the place is a little hidden which adds to the allure of this place.  They have a decent selection of food and we decided to try the sriracha mayo smoked salmon (with potato salad and macaroni salad) and chicken katsu (with curry and kale salad).  Our food came out and you immediately are drawn to how nice the plating is; and it's something you don't usually expect from small cafes. The salmon was over toast and had great flavor; I would've liked a little less toast as the slice was pretty thick. I also was not a fan of the potato salad as it had an off flavor that I am not use to. Seems like it was Japanese potato salad which I'm not an expert in, but it is not my cup of tea. The chicken katsu is some of the best I've had. It was suggested to us to get curry as one of the sides and it turned out to be good advice.  Definitely recommend!

However, they make a cute designs in your latte foam. My friend got a teddy bear face and I got an intricate leaf. For dinner, pretty much everyone got the chicken katsu curry. Perfectly fried on a bed of rice and side of pickled veggies. For my additional side, I got the Kale salad. It was a little heavy on the lemon and very tart, but I still ate it because it made me feel healthy.  I will definitely be back to experience the ambient atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food!",1

There's free wifi, and lots of individual tables as well as long tables by the windows with light. I got the lunch special chicken katsu, and it came with curry and kale salad as sides, and a mound of rice. My friends got the toasts and we shared a variety of sides together. Some of them really liked the macaroni, and I really liked the potato salad and curry, especially mixing the rice with the curry. The katsu itself was super tender and flavorful! The only side we didn't really like that much (or just didn't show it) was the kale salad. To me, it was pretty sour.  They also have special drinks like the toasted coconut matcha latte (or something like that) that was really good. There was also a blood orange something oolong that was very subtle. It tasted kind of like flavored water to me...  The lunch special+the drink came out to be around $13, which is not the cheapest, but for the good food and good environment, I would totally come back!",1
Coffee Shop 56,"Cute little place! Has some really cold shops around it, got the curry chicken toast wth macaroni and kale salad. Not a huge fan of kale so idk why I got the salad...

I have had the Chicken Katsu with macaroni salad (just ok imo) and curry (so good), Honey Butter Toast. I've never loved Kale so much before - their kale salad can be a bit salty but I wouldn't change it. But my go-to favorite is the lunch special Yakitori Bowl - see pic.

Coffee Shop 56,"HIPSTER. If you asked me to describe this place in one word, that would be it. Located in what seems to be an artist colony, Sa-Ten is a fusion of Japanese cuisine and a classic Austin cafe.  Drinks: I had the Ohayo and although it was pricey, ~$5 with tip, it was a pretty darn good latte. Would I get it again? Naw, not worth the price.  Food: Chicken teriyaki toast lunch plate is a good amount of food. You get fried teriyaki chicken (bit dry) , cheese toast, and 2 sides. I opted for the kale salad and macaroni salad which were both super refreshing! I've ordered the Sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast here which I also think isn't worth the price. You get the tiniest piece of smoked salmon on toast.  Ambience: quiet with a small amount of chatter between other customers, plenty of seats, natural lighting, and soothing music played in the background. I would totally study here I liked studying somewhere other than my bed. Also A+ for plenty of large parking spaces!  Overall 4/5 because some items on the menu are overpriced for what you get.

It's a good feeling; it's as if I've escaped the hustle and bustle of university and sought refuge in a very aesthetically-pleasing café. I love how the place looks. It feels so modern with their tall wooden doors and steel bar stools. Industrial. Sleek. But also inviting.  But you don't really care about how the place looks right? How was the FOOD? I had the chicken katsu sandwich ($6). They remind me of cucumber sandwiches because the crust is sliced off and their sauce is refreshingly cool (kewpie mayo, yogurt, and Worcestershire sauce combo??). However, I found the chicken to be a little dry. Could have used more sauce maybe? The green onions on top was good because it added a nice flavor! On the side are 3 pickled veggies (pickle, okra, carrot). I like pickled vegetables but if you don't like pickles...you probably won't like these.  My boyfriend had the teriyaki curry chicken toast ($7.50). The toast was thick and tasted like delicious carb-y goodness. There was more of a distinct flavor than the chicken katsu. I can see why their toast is more expensive!  The overall atmosphere is very conducive to working. It's quiet and they have nice relaxing instrumental music. They also have cards, jenga, and some board games. We sat outside (they have a counter with barstools and 3 tables outside) because the weather was so nice. I felt like I was looking at the desert because I was looking out to the sandy rocky ground..yeah okay I don't know I'm weird.

Coffee Shop 56,"12 check-ins Sa-Ten is a hidden gem in East Austin and I am so glad I came across this place. Sa-Ten has quickly become my favorite coffee shop in Austin for numerous reasons.  One, Sa-Ten is located in a really neat environment that has a nice aesthetic exterior. The ambience feels very modern and there are about three or four tables for outside seating. Second, the interior is equally as nice. Again, the interior has a very modernized Japanese vibe, which I absolutely love because it is so unique from other coffee shops in ATX. The big windows also provide a plethora of natural sunlight and significantly add to the modern ambience. Third, the coffee is amazing! I have had the cold brew and vanilla latte. Both were delicious and a great caffeine boost for rough mornings. Fourth, the food here is surprisingly really good. I say ""surprisingly,"" because most coffee shops I have been to have mediocre food. Sa-Ten serves a lot of various Japanese food and snacks. I would highly recommend the toast, which comes in a variety of flavors.  I come here at least once a week and I never regret it. Thank you for being the best coffee shop in ATX, Sa-Ten.

Coffee Shop 56,3 check-ins Coffee shop with good food?? Oh my have I found a gem. I throughly enjoyed this cute little place. I love that there are tons of parking spaces versus a ton of other coffee shops in Austin.  I tried the salmon toast and the chicken katsu with potato salad and macaroni salad. The salmon toast is absolutely delicious cheesy flavorful goodness. Get it. No question. The chicken katsu was also very good. It was crunchier than most katsus I've had but I enjoyed it. The macaroni salad is what surprised me. Think potato salad instead of Mac and cheese. It had slices of apple and cucumber in there and was very refreshing. The actual potato salad was more like a mashed potato. My BF got a curry side and I really liked it. The sides were definitely on the lighter side which complimented the dish as a whole wonderfully. Oh and the rice...I don't usually care for rice but this rice had some kind of seasoning on it and it was bomb.  I got the iced saifa for coffee. It was basically Vietnamese coffee meets vanilla latte. Aka delicious. My BF got the ohayo and that was also great. Is there anything here that's not? Will be frequenting this spot more. So glad I finally came here.,1
Coffee Shop 56,I was really impressed with this place. The food was very good and vanilla latte was well made. Will definitely be back.,1
Coffee Shop 56,"This may be one of my favorite places of 2016. I've been hankering for some katsu (chicken or pork) and stumbled upon this place whilst reading an article about Paul Qui. Considering I live on the eastside and never heard of this place, I figured I'd give it a shot. I ordered the Chicken Katsu with rice and curry along with the chicken karaage.  Let me just say, this place knocked it out of the park. I was impressed with how massive the portions were and it came with a kale salad included.

We had the teriyaki curry chicken toast with the lunch set. Teriyaki curry chicken with melted cheese & topped with Japanese pickles. Tasty chicken and scrumptious sides.

A little on the pricy side, but I have seen similar prices at bubble tea establishments (thick toast is a big thing in taiwan).  Next up, we had the chicken katsu set. The chicken katsu was delicious and breaded just right! The best part had to be the katsu! The set comes with a square block of rice. If you decide to order the side of curry, there probably won't be enough rice for you to mix!  Overall, a comfortable, fun place to hang out! A little deep into east austin, but worth the adventure.

Interior decor is so cute and cozy with lots of space for groups. There's also an area with board games.    Food: The toast items are really good (particularly the Sriracha Smoked Salmon). I've also gotten the breakfast yogurt ($7), which had a small portion and was quite average.  Drinks: I've only tried the Ohayo and Lavender Mocha. Both drinks are delicious, but I would definitely recommend the Lavender Mocha more because the lavender really stands out. On the other hand, the Ohayo, which is a cappuccino with brown sugar, didn't really taste that unique considering it was a house special. I didn't really taste the brown sugar at all.  Price: This is probably Sa-Ten's downfall. It's definitely a bit pricey considering the portions you are getting.

Coffee Shop 56,"Delicious menu, cute decor, and very chill vibe. I came here on a Sunday evening to get dinner and chat with friends. Sa-Ten is located in a remote warehouse area in east Austin next to a couple of art galleries. There was plenty of parking, and plenty of seating inside. Everything is very industrial-looking- exposed concrete, unfinished high ceilings, a lot of metal, etc. I ordered the chicken katsu with rice, with side items of curry and macaroni fuji salad. The portion was just right- I finished all of it and did not feel hungry or too full. I feel like if you order the chicken katsu, you HAVE to order the curry because they go so well together ( I just poured the curry over the chicken and rice). The macaroni salad was not bad either. I also tried the lemonade and it was delicious and refreshing. The decoration is very cute- they have plants in little Japanese cans, a fish tank TV, little squirrel patterns on the wall, interesting lightbulb lights...it's all a lot to take in and would be the perfect place to have lunch or coffee with friends.

Coffee Shop 56,"Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Love the concept of this coffeeshop--I feel like I've been transported to Japan though I've never been before.  Located in deep East Austin, it's quite a drive from where I live but it was well worth it. The eclectic decor is a treat in itself with squirrel wallpaper and a old tv set used as a fish tank...that's a first. There's also succulents on every table potted in tin cans (what a novel idea!).  I ordered their macchiato/espresso set which came with a cute tin tray lined with newspaper from Japan (talk about the details!) and a mini-spoon for stirring. That all came to an approximate total of 3 dollars--reasonable in my opinion. The food was also tasty though small for 7+ dollars. They offer a variety of open-faced toasts--the one I chose was with smoked salmon that was precut to four slices making it very easy to pull apart into bite-size pieces. When I make another stop here, I'll probably stick to just the coffee knowing that the food is a little steep for my taste.",1

Coffee Shop 56,"6 check-ins Listed in Cawfee & Tee In my language Sa-Ten means ""Ours"" and immediately I found myself liking this place. To me it has become a semi-sanctuary where I can be at peace. There seems to be an unwritten rule, like walking into a library, that one must pick up their feet when they walk as to not make extra noise, and not to speak too loudly. Which is not to say that people don't or are discouraged to talk here. In fact I've seen many groups collaborate on projects, however, everyone seems to be aware that this is a quiet zone.  The karaage is a favorite of mine and it's the only food item I've tried on the menu just because I always order it instead of trying something else. I'm going to have to break that habit.  It has never been crowded, they have a pretty good sized seating outdoors as well, a bar top set alongside the railing. I come here to get away from the noise of the city, I'm glad its out of kind of out of the way, and isn't easily seen from the street.  The interior design is pleasing to the eye. It is stylish but not overbearingly trendy nor minimalist. The decor is tasteful, warm and welcoming yet not one of those cozy cafes you find yourself falling asleep in. There's a good amount of parking.",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I'm a wee bit of a Japanophile and this was exactly what I needed in my hood! I've only been for dinner, but they have a great variety of homestyle Japanese dishes that is a refreshing break from your standard teriyaki.  I had the vegetable curry plate, which was delicious and so filling I could not eat the tasty side salad it came with. Very fresh-tasting, perfect sticky rice, sauce almost made me lick the plate. I look forward to returning on a day off for a toast lunch and coffee.  Further bonus points- very cute space, friendly staff, tons o parking, tucked away locale so no crazy crowds, fun variety of Japanese and other reading materials.",1
Coffee Shop 56,Cute cafe in a more remote area of East Austin.  I love their home style pork cutlet plates and other hot foods they have here. The coffee is a bit bland for my taste. They use a darker Brazillian roast for their espressos and I'm not a huge fan of that.  The decor is gorgeous. Looks like a hip coffee shop in Tokyo more than something in Austin. There's always seating and the wifi is good. Not much else to complain about.,1
Coffee Shop 56,Great place to get a bite to eat and coffee. Very laid back place . The menu has options for everyone. The coffee is on point. The staff is friendly. The price is very reasonable.  Do like the squirrel decor.,1
Coffee Shop 56,"Listed in Asian Foodisms Great cold brew coffee, decent iced tea, but the real bonus is the chill and spacious atmosphere!  I came here for a quick brainstorming session with my interns. The wifi was a bit spotty (the only reason for the 4 stars) but otherwise we all agreed that the space is super cute.  Cold brew coffee: more concentrated than average and very good. There's a choice of cream or soy milk.  Black iced tea: decent, I am not a tea snob (not like my dad anyway) but this is definitely not Lipton. First refill is free; refills after that are $1.

Sa-Tén is such an interesting place - the environment is warm and comfortable, especially on this chilly Austin day, with large windows that light up the room with sunshine. Plenty of table and bar seating, quiet, perfect for catching up with a friend, studying, or reading, all while enjoying some coffee and unique Japanese snackage.  THE FOOD/DRINK:  + Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast ($7.50) - smoked salmon, sriracha mayo, mozzarella cheese, green onion, and strips of dried seaweed on a thick piece of toast - crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The sriracha mayo is not too heavy, but adds a kick and went perfectly with the super tender smoked salmon. Super, duper delicious. Would order again.  + Nori Tama Toast ($6.00) - THIS WAS SO GOOD: egg salad spread, green onion, sesame seeds, and dried seaweed on toast. The egg salad was creamy, light, and delicious, with a nice nutty flavor from the sesame seeds.  + Chicken Katsu with Curry ($10.00) - Yummy! Strips of super tender, crunchy-breaded chicken, topped with what looked like more of the egg salad spread. The rice that was served with it was fresh and delicious, and even more so with the thick, flavorful, slightly spicy yellow curry sauce. The kale salad was also super crispy and fresh.  + Hot Matcha Chai Latte ($3.75) - For some reason, the 16 oz. cup was only $0.25 more than the 12 oz., so naturally, we got the 16 oz. Maybe it was some sort of question of marginal utility vs. price, who knows? The matcha chai latte was great - even for someone who doesn't normally enjoy the spiciness of chai. The chai spice was not too strong (but still aromatic and present), and puncuated by the slight sweet-bitterness and scent of the matcha. It was really yummy.  Four stars because I think the food here is a bit pricey for the portions you get.  Overall, a really good experience at this cute little coffee shop. If the food doesn't convince you to go, think about the squirrel wallpaper on the walls - the squirrels want you to go. sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast (bottom left), nori tama toast (bottom right), & chicken katsu with curry",1

There's not enough hidden away coffee places here in Austin, TX (most places are just too crowded and filled with college students cramming for finals for me) so when I found this little hip, tucked away coffee shop, I knew it would become my go-to.  I've been here a handful of times before I decided to write a review. Every experience has been great! There are PLENTY of parking (+++) and seating (+++). Their menu is diverse with various options but over my past few visits I've tried:  - Iced Lattes (5/5): A coffee shop has got to have good coffee for me to want to come back. It's great here, and super consistent. - Potato Salad Sandwich (5/5): I don't even like potato salads. Enough said. - Blueberry Muffin (4/5): Fresh & delicious!  My friend ordered one of the toasts and loved it as well - so those are on my to-try list for sure! And the donuts!!!  Anyways, I love the vibe here. It's perfect for a late evening coffee run with a nice chat out in the front on one of the benches.  Sa-ten is definitely a TEN! Potato Salad Sandwich Iced Caramel Latte",1
Coffee Shop 56,"25 check-ins There is so much to love about this coffee shop. For one its location is quite unique and tucked among artist studios/art galleries (Canopy). In terms of their drinks, they aren't quite as fancy as some of the other coffee shops in Austin but they at least do it right. The food menu is very good and execution is great while blending a lot of asian flare to it. My favorite so far has been the cold chicken katsu sandwich. During most of the day I have always found the coffee shop not too overwhelmed by students and plenty of seating available. Internet has always been quick. Jazz plays beautifully over head. And staff attentive and on point. See all photos from Anthony N. for Sa-Ten",1

Sa-Ten nailed the Japanese coffee shop vibe, from the squirrel decorations everywhere to the Japanese wood colors to the tv converted into a fish tank?!...everything is perfect.  Their coffee is legit. Love the Iced Vanilla Latte and the Iced Saifa. And definitely get something to eat. Their toasts are godlike! My eyes roll back every time I take a bite out of the toast. Chicken Kara-age is solid, as well as the dinner plates. Their curry is true to Japan.  One of the few places where I'll say ""Take my money!""

The sauce and the crunchiness of the meat were on point! The sriracha mayo smoked salmon was decent and both lunch specials have 2 sides. For sides, we had salad, curry, potato salad and pasta salad and they were all delicious. I was impressed with the food presentation and how nicely everything looked including the square rice comes with chicken katsu! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Americano. It was very water down and it had weird and funky taste. My friend had their iced latte and he really enjoyed it. This is a nice study/brunch/lunch/afternoon tea spot! Austin is full of good surprises! Chicken Katsu Smoked salmon toast",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I've been intending to come here furrrrever. A coffee spot that actually has food that's not green cart? Count me in! They're located inside this awesome complex called Canopy that's just off Springdale with plenty of parking and lots of cool galleries and shops I'm going to have to come back for.  This place is quiet. I mean, like super zen quiet. There were about 20 people in there and we were still practically whispering. If you work from home and get distracted by the raucous coffee shop regulars, this is a nice hideaway.  I had the chicken with japanese curry. Though it looked like a smallish portion, I found myself taking some of it home. All the flavors were really fresh and the chicken was done well (lightly fried). It's a place to get a good balance of greens, protein and something more exotic than your typical $5 slice of east side pie. Zzzzzz.  Sa-Ten is a little bit out of the way but cool enough that it's worth the trip. Wifi",1
Coffee Shop 56,"On the way home I searched ""sushi"" into Yelp and this place popped up. While they don't serve sushi, they do serve Japanese food and boy is it good! I had the special of chicken yakitori with a delicious kale salad, fresh corn, and rice. I am so amazed by the quality, I will definitely be coming back!  The ambience is lovely; cozy, good music, smells great, perfect for bringing a book. Minus one star because I wish they had more comfy seating and not just the wooden hard chairs.

Coffee Shop 56,"Listed in Coffee in Austin This one is a good drive but worth it. It's located in this artist colony on the Far East side. That gives it a pretty unique feel. They have a lot of the regular coffee staples like lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, etc. However they have a few Japanese style coffee drinks as well.  Really, the place has this whole Japanese theme which is pretty cool. There is a large seating area with a large window facade with bar seating. You will likely not have an issue with sitting here. They have a really unique menu too. Chicken Karage, Sa-Ten Toast, all is great. I am a a fan of the Teriyaki Curry Chicken myself.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend dropping by for maybe an hour or so, kick back, get a drink, read a book, look at art, and enjoy life!",1

At first I thought they would be closed because it was closed but I saw two cars in front. I had coffee which I needed and yes I do drink coffee in the evenings. To accompany my coffee, I had Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon which hit the spot. I didn't want anything too heavy.  There's some outside tables.

Coffee Shop 56,"3 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" I thought I wasn't going to like this place but I was wrong. The idea of $7 hipster toast and a $10 chicken-katsu plate seems a little redonk to me, but what caught me by surprise were the unadvertised sandwich plate specials, like the grilled broccoli & grilled potato sandwich. I was genuinely intrigued.  Unfortunately I don't eat on Tuesdays, so I can't tell you how the food is. What I can tell you is my $2.44 pint of drip Casa Brasil was dark and potent, the staff I engaged with were fun and cool, and listening to the kids at the school next door to this renovated warehouse complex was pretty close to a Zen moment. I think we should definitely put Sa-Ten on the list, and come back & try all their food. Um, when's the last time you saw a squirrel coffee cup? It's so weird it's cool.

Coffee Shop 56,"2 check-ins ROTD Listed in Places to Revisit! I love the atmosphere at this cafe. It's also a plus that they serve food as well as coffee. I think I really enjoyed the quiet, vintage-like atmosphere of this cafe. I ordered the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast and Ohayo coffee, and this was a good combination. I was looking for a snack in between lunch and dinner, and this was the perfect size. The toast is very crispy and fresh out of the oven tasting, and the salmon was cooked just right. I also think they sprinkle some roe on the top, and it definitely adds some flavor to the dish.  I think I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food at this location. It is definitely quieter than a Starbucks and more intimate. They also have these board games you can play, and I stayed and played Monopoly for almost two hours. I think it's a really great place to just hang out or catch up with your friends.  And on a side note, we almost missed this place because it's a little bit hidden in between buildings, but definitely a great place to try out!

Coffee Shop 56,An absolutely stunning space. The coffee won me over. I'm generally a purist but I have to say that their Ohayo is a fantastic cappuccino treat. We have yet to try the food but it has looked delicious when others have ordered it. It is firmly in our rotation of east-side stops.,1
Coffee Shop 56,I came here for some coding help from a friend.  The set up of the coffee shop is actually pretty great for studying.  It is not as dark and cramped as most hipster coffee shops in Austin.  I hate hipster coffee shops.  Why would you go somewhere to study that's dark and cramped?  That makes no sense!  Anyways I ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee and toast with bacon and sausage spread.  Everything was delicious and just right for a study snack.  I would definitely come back here for my future study sessions.,1
Coffee Shop 56,2 check-ins Coffee house in a garage? Ok but it's much more than that. This place is a staple on the east side. Want to see hot artsy chicks? They are here. Want to get a bunch of work done while eating curry dishes? You can do that too. The vibe in here is calm and quiet which is important in a coffee shop right? Bc we wanna get shit done while peeping over at the next person. Bc secretly inside we know we could be doing this work at home but we would rather be striking up a convo with the next person. Highly recommend,1

Looking forward to it!",1
Coffee Shop 56,"I ate here during the East Austin Studio tour. My girlfriend and I had the smoked salmon toast and the potato salad. I don't know what to say. We hated them both. The toast is like a triple-thick piece of white bread, and it has a few strips of very fishy tasting salmon baked on top with cheese and sriracha. We only ate a quarter of it. The potato salad wasn't as bad, but it was more like cold mashed potatoes. It wasn't what I think of as potato salad.  But everyone was friendly, and the place is cute. And that's all we had, so maybe other stuff is better. But we disliked the toast enough to want to leave a review.",0
Coffee Shop 56,"12 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost I love Sa-Ten.  At $2.15 for a small cup of coffee, their coffee is both affordable and delicious.  They use Casa Brasil, which is one of my personal favorites in regards to roasters in Austin. I've also tried the Ohayo (the house special) and Iced Saifa (similar to a vietnamese coffee) - both of which are fantastic. Just get them. I can't comment on the food too much, but I have tried their salmon toast and it was good!  I appreciate the design and ambiance as well. It's clean and simple, yet still unique and retro. The Japanese influence is clear here, and there's also squirrel wallpaper!! (I freakin' love that.) The service is great, friendly, and unpretentious. Sa-Ten is a good fit for getting work done, meeting up with folks, and unwinding with a cup of coffee, and I think that's even shown by the diverse crowd that comes in here.  Lastly, they've played swing/big band style music the two times I've been here so far. My favorite.

Coffee Shop 56,"3 check-ins I somehow ended up going to Sa-Tén three times this past weekend out of pure happenstance, but every time was a pleasant experience. Their toasts are big, thick slices of buttery bread with the topping of your choice. I got the yasai the first time (cheese, broccoli, tomato, bell pepper, asparagus) and the teriyaki curry chicken the second. I also tried the Sa-Tén salad with grilled veggies, and would highly recommend it! I've had both the macchiato set and the iced saifa to drink. I wasn't blown away by either but not repulsed either. The whole restaurant is so cute though. I saw a lot of people bringing their laptops and working since it is relatively quiet too. Perfect coffee shop environment. Yasai toast Macchiato set",1

Coffee Shop 56,Went here for the first time a couple months ago with some girlfriends for a nice lunch and it was more than we could be expected! The food is comparable to an upscale version of the Don Japanese Food Truck cuisine. It does have better portion sizing and taste though in my opinion! The staff were very chill and I love the feel of the restaurant. The decor and ambience is quiet and relaxed enough for it to be a great study spot or place to work or catch up with a friend! The food was delicious and I loved the little side salad as well as the katsu. The breading on the katsu was just crunchy enough and the flavor of the seasoning on the rice was so unique! Will definitely be coming back to east Austin for this.,1

Coffee Shop 63,"PLEASE open a South or West Austin location! We found this place on a quest to find mint mojito coffee like Philz has. We first tried the Factory which was very disappointing but then we found this spot just on the other side of the building! We drive up here from south Austin multiple times per week. Fun menu options that aren't expected but also aren't weird or pretentious. I love their Sea Salt Creme Coffee. It's crazy good. Also, they make boba RIGHT. Sweet and tacky, but never hard or difficult to chew. My fiance gets the mint coffee which is delicious. My only change I'd request is that when muddling the leaves they try not to break them up into tiny pieces. Or to offer it with a hot drink lid maybe. No big deal though. The milk tea is also great and classic. I had the Thai tea today which was my least favorite because the tea was very weak, but I hope this was just a fluke. The sea salt coffee is still my top pick. Of the servers, one sticks out in particular which is the girl with the purple hair (sorry, I don't think I've caught her name yet!) She's super sweet and knowledgeable about how they make their drinks and what they all taste like.",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Listed in The Bubble Tea Connoisseur First off, it's important to keep in mind that this a tea shop in the traditional style first and foremost - they serve hot coffees, freshly brewed teas, fresh juices, and some finger foods. It is, for the majority, not a bubble tea shop. I will write primarily about the bubble tea but will adjust my final rating accordingly. Today I deviated from my usual order and got a jasmine milk tea with regular boba.  Authentic flavor - 5/5 stars  This is as authentic as it gets (the window says the teas are 100% organic). This is literally loose leaf tea steeped over hot water, blended with milk and ice on top. It is nowhere close to artificially sweet. This is genuine, pure, high quality tea. This is also the first place I've tried where the milk does NOT overpower the tea! So many bubble tea shops try to overcompensate for the slightly natural bitter taste of tea by putting way too much milk in their teas. Not Tea Haus, though; the natural flavour of the tea is allowed to shine. In fact, I would argue I tasted much more of the tea than the milk. In short, it was perfect.  Boba taste and consistency - 4/5 stars  Pleasantly surprised. They use a natural sweetener (I'm guessing honey?) so you won't taste the sickeningly sweet and sticky goodness of sugar coated boba, but for a store that prides itself on freshness, that makes sense. Consistency is nice, a little chewier than I like but not too tough. I do wish they had given me more, though. There was barely a layer at the bottom of the cup, but I did also order a small, so.....  Menu offerings - 3/5 stars  A little bit of everything, but not enough of any one thing. This can either be taken as a plus or a minus. They have a good selection of loose leaf teas and coffee (their main menu item), but the food, fresh juices, lemonades, and bubble tea are almost an afterthought. I would be interested in trying out the loose leaf teas in combination with some milk/boba, but in terms of bubble tea you're fairly limited; the  grapefruit honey green tea is their only fruit optio. This means, sadly, I probably won't return because I don't really like milk teas (I'm more of a fruit tea person), but what I did drink today was delicious enough that I would recommend you try them out if you enjoy milk teas. Other things to note: get their basil chicken, it's delicious.  Cafe decor and ambiance - 5/5 stars  I am such a sucker for quaint looking cafes. This is what Starbucks would look like if it fused with one of those warehouse coworking spaces that startups like to rent. It's a little unfinished, but that's part of the ambiance. Lots of individuals were sitting around at 5pm on a Monday, tapping away on their computer trying to get work done. Jazzy music plays in the background. It's generally quiet, a space to relax or focus instead of a place to bring a huge group. Even the tables, which can seat six, are taken up by individuals working alone. There are ample outlets (thank god) and speedy wifi.  Final rating - 4/5 stars Jasmine boba milk tea",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Stopped by to get something refreshing before heading back to Dallas. Tried out the lychee iced tea which was good - not too sweet which is why I liked it!

Coffee Shop 63,"Wow! Tea Haus is really good! It's nice to have some great milk tea here in Austin. After months (or even a year) or trying to get away from Tapioca House and Coco's Cafe near the UT Campus, this place gets my top list on the milk tea chart!  Some of my favorites are the Honey boba milk tea and the Sea Salt Creme Coffee! The boba is nice and chewy, along with a thin layer of honey to naturally sweeten the drink. The Sea Salt Creme coffee has a nice strong coffee flavor to it.  When it comes to their food, I get nothing else, except the Basil Fried Chicken. Tasting very similar to the Chicken nugget combo at Tapioca House, the quality and flavor of the chicken tastes a lot better here than anywhere else!  There is plenty of seating everywhere, so if you are in the mood to study, enjoy a good book, or chatting with friends, this place is a good place to do all of these things!",1
Coffee Shop 63,My friends and I were at the pho place next door and decided to walk over to Tea Haus for some boba for dessert after. I ordered the boba jasmine milk tea. The tapioca (honey boba) is very sweet (too sweet for me) and there was too much ice in the drink. I also had a slight problem with the service here. The guy who took my order barely spoke to me and seemed to be very out of it for whatever reason. It also took an unusually long amount of time for our orders to be ready.

Nice mix of coffee and mint flavors. Refreshing.  Sea Salt Creme Coffee (4.5/5) - Tea Haus uses Summer moon's coffee, so it's bound to be good. I tried this coffee expecting it to taste similar to 85 C's, but the saltiness was less pronounced, and was more balanced out by the sweetness and creaminess. Overall I'm really happy to find sea salt coffee in Austin.  Strawberry brick toast (3.5/5) - After having toasts at Korean bakeries, this didn't impress me. It was literally a brick of toast that was not toasted, and was drizzled with condensed milk and topped with fresh strawberries. I was looking for a difference in consistency, such as a slightly crunchy toasted exterior contrasted with soft warm interior. Nope.",1
Coffee Shop 63,"9 check-ins Pros:  Mojito coffee, basil chicken, and the milk teas are great.  I love that they are open until 10pm most evenings, which seems to be a little later than a lot of the other coffee houses around town.  The restaurant always looks clean and it is in a shopping center with plenty of parking relatively close by.  It seems like a lot of students like to come bring their laptops and work here.  There is a variety of seating choices from small to large tables and a bar along the wall to sit at.  Cons: Brick Toast is a little dry.  Something to give it a more moist overall texture like a pound cake or angel cake would suit me better.  I ordered a musubi once and I think they nuked it way too long because the spam was brown instead of pink, and the rice was crunchy.  Once we went in and the AC was blasting so strong that we needed to sit in our car which was a bummer. Coffee story Outside window Brick toast See all photos from Charles Y. for Tea Haus",1

The flavor is so strong and satisfying. Organic honey milk + boba was good. I could taste the honey.. Go Organic.  Chicken bits were good as usual, the best in town. Large portion with huge chicken bits balance with basil flavor and leaves.  The background music was a bit too loud.. Otherwise, this place would be wonderful for a quick stop by or study spot.

Coffee Shop 63,"5 check-ins Pretty disappointed on my visit today. My friend & I ordered the sea salt creme coffee. The first time we got our drink, mine was super sweet & his was water down. I'm thinking the girl that made the drink (don't know her name) put all the sugar in my drink. We asked them if they can make it again, but this time the drinks seemed diluted. Unhappy, we were just going to ask for our money back, but the lady worker annoyingly asked ""do you just want me to put more sugar?"" and proceeded to do so. I understand, we were one of those annoying customers, but what aggravated me was when she rolled her eyes & said ""oh my god"" right in front of us....rude Tbh if I see her working, I won't be ordering from Tea Haus again.",0
Coffee Shop 63,"7 check-ins As far as tapioca goes, Tea Haus is decent. Their drinks are also alright, but there aren't very many choices, so if you're not craving something that's on the menu, you're kind of at a loss. I'm also not a fan of their grapefruit drink - it had little bits of grapefruit zest that didn't add any flavor to the drink in my opinion.  Their hot coffee is pretty average - I ordered a latte once and it was just alright. Nothing special! I think the best item on the menu is probably their sea salt iced coffee.  The general vibe of Tea Haus is a hipster spin off of your regular boba tea spot. I like the large tables in the back, but often find it difficult to find seating here. There are definitely a lot of cute places to take a photo for Instagram though!  This isn't my first choice for studying, coffee, or boba, but it's still a nice place to visit if you're in the area!",1
Coffee Shop 63,"3 check-ins Wow.  How can I say this without overstating just how happy I was with how perfect everything was about my visit?  I don't think I can...but I will try.  Tea Haus is right next door to Phonatic(which is also great in their own right)but I was in the mood to try something I know I have experience with and that is Boba Teas.  Now keep in mind, I grew up in Houston which has a gigantic Asian community and I currently live in Chinatown Houston.  So my experience with Asian teas is pretty good.  There are only 2-3 that I love in the Houston area and the rest are mediocre or they just over sweeten their drinks.  So I order a Jasmine Milk Tea with Tapioca and their signature Strawberry Brick Toast.  The tea was served promptly while the toast took about 10 mins to prepare.  I took one sip of the tea and it was velvety smooth and sweetened just right!  I could taste the tea blend and jasmine without the sweet overpowering the whole thing but the best part?  The boba tapioca.  My goodness, I thought I'd tried the very best before but whatever it is that they do here to the boba I hope they stick to it.  It was PERFECTLY chewy, soft centers and they were sweetened unlike any other tapioca I had tried before.  Now don't get me wrong, other places are good too but Tea Haus' boba has something special going for it and I can't put taste buds on it but I fell in love!  Best Jasmine Milk Tea ever!  Then the brick toast was called.  I walk to the kitchen window to get it and I was amazed at the presentation!  For a moment there I felt like Chef Gordon Ramsey being served some fancy dessert to judge!  It was fat like a brick and covered with strawberries.  Cut a piece and took a bite..  I almost called the moving company to move my stuff into this place because I didn't want to leave!  The toast fast fantastic!  Perfectly toasted and sweet with some sort of buttery texture and the strawberries just made everything pop perfectly together.  You just have to try it yourself.  Now don't be deceived..it looks super sweet like french toast but it's beyond that and the sweetness is perfectly balanced.  Split it with a friend if you're worried about calories lol!  My only complaint is that now when I do have milk tea or any sort of dessert toast I am gonna compare it to this place and it's just too darn far for me to drive to every time I want my milk tea fix!  But if you're local, you should check it out.  It was perfect and the service was super friendly! Would you like to join me in my quarters for some toast? Encarnacion approved! Jasmine milk tea w honey boba. Comfy See all photos from Jesse C. for Tea Haus",1
Coffee Shop 63,"4 check-ins ROTD Their boba is delicious unlike other boba I've had. It's sweet being that it's soaked in honey!  As others have stated they've got a simple menu with a few teas, coffees, lemonades, and snacks. I tried the jasmine and reg milk teas and they're both delicious. They nailed it!! My fav is the Jasmine. It's so silky and has a slight floral taste. It's divine!  Get the large! I made the mistake of getting regular sizes and nearly slurped my drink down before I could get back on the highway!  I can't wait to get back and try more stuff!

Coffee Shop 63,"I only ever come here for coffee. They make this sea salt and salted caramel drink that I like to get from time to time. Always attentive service, quick, and efficient. I really appreciate that they get me in and out. Also, CLEAN! Well appreciated. Plus, they serve Summer moon and I love their coffee (best in my opinion).  Never tried the tea but I'll have to sometime. Everyone seems to rave about them!",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Honestly, I wanted to love this place... even like it... but the quality of the product is not like I have around me. The girl taking my order was really sweet and friendly but that's the extent of positive feedback for this place. The drinks are not good... waaaaaaaaay too sweet even with 1/4 sugar request. The lemonade drinks were really acidic. The brick toast was drier than it should be. And unfortunately, the wait for the products was too long too and I was the only customer.",0
Coffee Shop 63,This is a great place if you're wanting to meet someone for coffee/tea. Totally digged the vibe and music. I got the green juice drink for the day - a little on the higher end but that's alright. I would come back here again. Tons of outlets for your laptop and plenty of parking.,1
Coffee Shop 63,"Another afternoon escape from my weekend conference in Austin.  Ordered: - basil chicken: freshly made and juicy flavors! Good portion size for $5.75. Definitely a decent appetizer at a typical restaurant, but I have been to Taiwanese places that will give you twice the portion for the same price. But this is a ""hipster"" cafe after all, so for this standard - it's worth getting! - sea salt creme coffee: a ton of ice goes into this drink. Initial impression: great flavors, creamy and not too sweet. An hour later when all the ice has melted? Ugh can't even get a sip down. Moral of the story? Drink fast but worth it as well.  Total was less than $10, which was pretty decent. A typical latte and pastry at a coffee shop will also be at least $7.  Decent wifi! Which I always appreciate. Friendly staff and seems to be welcoming for people of all ages. I will definitely come back next time I'm around. Basil Chicken and Sea Salt Creme Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 63,"11 check-ins Listed in 2015 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., BUBBLES. My bubbles. This is as good as it gets, folks. Hands down my favorite bubble tea in all of Austin. Probably in all of everywhere. If it weren't for Angie L., it might have taken me forever to try this place.  I get the black milk tea because it is so gosh darn delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of sweet and this is PERFECT. It tastes more like tea and less like sugar and I can't get enough. If you dig bubble tea that is less sweet and more tea-like, you will love this. The boba are also perfect - wonderfully chewy and they give you plenty.  I also got to try the basil fried chicken and it is fantastic. Seriously. For only $5, you get a very generous serving of deliciously fried basil chicken that is tender and juicy. Remember my Love Balls review and how I felt about the Chicken Thing? I feel the same way about the basil fried chicken here.  I've heard the lemonades are awesome and I keep meaning to try one, but that black milk tea always calls my name and I can't resist. One day, though, I'm gonna try a lemonade. And probably also get a black milk tea because why not both? And I better add some basil fried chicken because delicious.  I love you, Tea Haus. The Boba Milk Tea is awesome! Not too sweet and actually tastes like tea. I'm a fan!",1
Coffee Shop 63,I lovvveeeeeeeee this place. The lychee green tea with boba is my favorite! There are pieces of lychee in the drink and it's very refreshing.  The basil fried chicken is LEGIT! Full of flavor and crispy.  The drinks are affordable and delicious. One of my favorite tea places in Austin! Lychee green tea with and without boba Basil fried chicken,1
Coffee Shop 63,"Pleasantly surprised by this place! Great tea quality, not your typical bubble tea place.  I tried their original milk tea, and the tea flavor really comes through. I actually found the milk tea not sweet enough, but it is one of the best milk tea places I have been in Austin! It is not overwhelmed with sweetener or artificial flavors,and tasted very 'natural'.  My friend got the grapefruit green tea, which is good too. The drink is not too sweet, and is really refreshing. Highly recommend this place! Regular milk tea with honey boba, and grapefruit honey green tea",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Love this place, mint mojito iced coffee for $5.15, incredibly delicious and highly recommended. Come here.",1
Coffee Shop 63,The drinks are okay...the boba's decent. It's quite challenging to chew through the hard tapioca. I had their boba milk tea and jasmine tea boba with normal sweetness. Both tasted watered down and super bland. I would probs choose tea haus as my last resort boba kingdom.,1
Coffee Shop 63,"Tea Haus is located in a strip mall, next to a Walmart. The inside is quite spacious, but rather dimly lit towards the back which doesn't make it ideal for studying. There's also only a couple of outlets, so make sure your laptops are fully charged if you plan on coming here to do work.  Tea Haus's milk tea is really good, but the last couple times I've been it tasted a little lukewarm. I think they might pour their tea in hot since the ice melts really fast and waters down the tea. Their lemonades are also a good choice, since they are freshly squeezed (but quite tart!)",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Tried Tea Haus because it was so highly rated. I tried the Honey Grapefruit Green Tea and the Honey Milk Tea with Boba. The presentation is nice but I wasn't that impressed. Both drinks were a little too sweet for me, it would've been nice to know they could customize the sweetness level.  But since it's so damn hot in Austin, I give Tea Haus an extra star because it probably saved my life from dehydration.",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Best bubble tea I've ever had! Its a small amount of options compared to some other bubble tea places, but they had classic flavors like jasmine green tea and other unique flavors as well. They also had some coffees, and two food/snack options on the wall. The bubble tea itself (I got the jasmine) was so. good. The tapioca didn't taste frozen or sweet, the tea wasn't loaded with sugar and I could actually drink the whole thing--it also tasted like the real tea rather than flavoring from a powder. Good stuff. Yum! The layout is a bit confusing, but just make sure to wait on the side of the counter by all the chairs/tables so you hear your order called. Other than that, totally yummy. :) Drank the whole thing, I can never finish other bubble teas, too sweet. But this place was just right",1
Coffee Shop 63,"When I first walked in I was so confused. It was packed with what looked like a ton of college students...I thought to myself, what the heck am I on UT campus??? I ordered the regular milk tea with honey boba, the basil fried chicken, and the brick toast. The milk tea tasted pretty good and the boba had good consistency. The basil fried chicken was delicious and gets 5 stars alone. But, the brick toast is where the biggest disappointment was. I'm sorry but this was overhyped. It's literally a huge slice of toast doused in condensed milk with some sliced strawberries on top and it tastes exactly as described. Not impressed. I'd say go for the milk tea and chicken and skip the toast! Milk tea with honey boba and basil fried chicken Brick toast...meh not as great as it looks",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Sometimes simplicity is all you need.  Tea Haus has a couple coffee options, a couple of tea options and a couple difference lemonade options.  For food they have 3 things on the menu - basil fried chicken, brick toast and affogato.  Simplicity is winning here at Tea Haus.    I had the mint blueberry lemonade and it was phenomenal!  I was at an UYE and the table had several orders of basil fried chicken and brick toast.  The fried chicken was delicious!  The brick toast was great too!  Everything is freshly made.  Even the drinks are made as you order them.    The atmosphere here has a modern feel and is great for a small get together with friends or studying by yourself.  If you are in the area and looking for a snack and a refreshment definitely stop in here.  If there was a location down south I would definitely become a regular.

Coffee Shop 63,"4 check-ins Listed in Favorite Nearby Neighborhood Eats Lemonade I don't think will ever taste the same again after my visit to Tea Haus.  The interior is modern with dark tones that make the atmosphere calm and relaxing.  This is the type of place you can catch up on work, or meet up with people.  I happened to come for the purpose of meeting up with peeps.  They have a streamlined menu, which makes it easy to find something to order.  The focus is on beverages, but they do have a couple of food items. The group ordered Basil Fried Chicken and brick toast which both looked amazing, and everyone raved about.  For us wheat sensitive folk, they did have premade plastic wrapped gluten free items from Russell's bakery at the front counter.    The beverage options range from raw pressed juices by Daily Green, homemade lemonades, a variety of tea and coffee drinks, and Boba milk tea.  I ordered the coconut chia lemonade, and then waited for my order. My drink was the last to come out, as I learned their lemonades are so fresh, they are made as you order.  The wait is worth it though, as the lemonade is definitely one of the best I have ever had. A refreshing drink to beat the summer heat. Coffee beans are thanks to Austin coffee roaster Sumer Moon.

Coffee Shop 63,"Listed in Treat yo self!, Java Jivin' I'm a coffee person over tea, but I genuinely enjoyed Tea Haus! It's very modern and clean while still maintaining a comfortable atmosphere making it ideal for either working or meeting up with friends.  I came because I was so generously invited to Angie L's UYE. My first instinct was to go with coffee, but I ordered their signature milk tea with honey boba to branch out and try something new. I will be honest and say the drink itself I didn't care for, but if you are a tea person then you will LOVE it. The honey boba balls in the bottom of the drink were killer!! I wanted to order a separate bowl of just those to snack on.  I'm sure they make a delicious cup of joe so next time I'm sticking with that. Plenty of variety on those drinks as well such as lattes made with both Ghirardelli chocolate and caramel, coffee with a sea salt creme, and one of my favorite drinks in the world the Affogato which is normally vanilla ice cream and espresso but here they add caramel and chocolate to it too because why not?  Obviously they have a nice tea selection, but believe it or not they even have creative lemonades like coconut chia with mint. We got to try their basil chicken and brick toast as well. I've always been weird about chicken and hadn't eaten it in a while, so when I got a piece that was fatty that was it for me. Everyone else really enjoyed it though because the spices they use are amazing. Make sure to squeeze the lime on top first to even out the flavors.  The brick toast however was right up my alley. It's a slice of thick toast where the top has been soaked in sweetened condensed milk. Before serving they add sliced strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. YUMMMM! Give me that and a coffee and I'm one happy girl. Definitely looking forward to a return visit.

Coffee Shop 63,"Listed in 2015 Challenge: 100 done!, Yelp's happenin'? Three words: Basil Fried Chicken! A little on the salty side; however, a tad sweet too, moist, interesting, and for 5 bucks for a large cup it's a bargain to boot. An extra star for the tasty chicken! Next football game, I want 4 orders of this stuff (in lieu of wings; yeah, I mean it) and a cold beer (no alcoholic bevs here of course) = great combo!  Now onto the rest. Angie L's UYE! Yay! Gathered with a group of fellow Yeeps (= always a good time!), all of our first time visiting Tea Haus BTW, and were treated by the lovely, cool-ass Angie to some of TH's popular goodies.    Very inviting Zen like, modern interior with a cozy nook to sit or long tables at the back.  Fairly limited menu to choose from (which is great for a sometimes indecisive gal like myself): 6 signature bevs/coffees (including Boba Milk Tea, Sea Salt Crème Coffee, and regulars like lattes and such), and a few choices on handcrafted lemonades (Arnold Palmer anyone?). On our virgin voyage, I opted for an iced chamomile with boba (sadly I can't do caffeine) and the hubs had the Boba Milk - I loooove boba; however my husband is typically not all that interested, but he sucked his drink down faster than a Dyson picks up dust. So A+ for sure!  Three food items to nosh on: aforementioned Basil Fried Chicken, something called Affogato (ice cream something I think; didn't try), and these large squares of perfection called Brick Toast. Stacks of bread, covered with reduced condensed milk and lovely , fresh strawberry halves. Not overly sweet. Just right. Perfect balance of flavor and texture. Yum. Would be really great with a hot cup of coffee or tea.  Overall: One cool joint. Super friendly staff. Boba and fried chicken in one spot - I'm in it to win it. Great drinks, nom nom snacks, great locale, easy parking...yay, I'm a fan!  I'm also a fan of Angie! Thanks so much for the invite, introduction, ""info,"" and for picking up everybody's tab!!!

Coffee Shop 63,"Updated review 18 check-ins Came back many MANY more times, and my love for Tea Haus is still as strong as the first time I experienced it.  They're getting more and more crowded, which makes me sad to have to wait in a line and talk over a greater volume of chatter, but super happy that they're doing well.  They won't be going anywhere for a while.  Over the last couple visits I've tried two more things on their ever-expanding menu.  Mint Mojito Iced Coffee Ooooh wow.  On a hot day, this is seriously refreshing.  You can see and feel the small leaves of mint flowing over your tongue and down your throat.  It's sweet and delicious.  Loving the great, yet not too powerful coffee flavor.  Will definitely add this into my rotation.  Affogato Delicious dessert, especially for the price!  Three generous scoops of ice cream, strong coffee flavor, and I love the powder (coffee or cocoa?) over the top.  I REALLY like this dessert.  And the quantity is definitely enough for two to share.  If I'm eating dinner on Anderson and feeling that sweet tooth afterwards, you can expect me to drive over to Tea Haus for some of this stuff.  Seriously, I've done this already.  Shout out again to their customer service.  Charlie was at the register today and remembered my name!  Mad props!  Or is it cause I come here too much? Spam musubi Affogato",1
Coffee Shop 63,"Updated review 41 check-ins ROTD Listed in Best Authentic (or as close as you can get) Asian foods, Bc Im so cool.. here are my RoTDs Its been only 5 months since I first discovered this place and this is easily my second home. Before I would always get the milk tea boba but asked for them to do it hot (not a lot of boba places will do it hot but it reminds me of the motherland). Als its the middle of Texas summer so that would be crazy right now. So lately I have tried their lemonades and regular cold milk tea bobas.  My favorite lemonade hands down is the blueberry mint. Its tart, sweet, and so freshing! It does take a few minutes to make so be patient, when its done it comes out the window by the kitchen in the back. As noted in my previous review, their milk tea is a perfect balance of tea and sweetness. They dont over sweetened their milk tea so it really brings the tea flavor out. I have had both the green tea and the black tea milk boba but since I am a boring person, I am more partial to the original black milk tea. The staff is always wonderful and lovely! My dog training is right nearby so on Wednesdays I bring my pup with me and she can hang out outside with the doggy water bowl while I run in to grab a drink. They are nice enough to bring it out to me everytime so that way I can chill outside with the dog.  When I am craving something sweet, the strawberry brick toast hits the spot. It has large halved strawberries on top of a giant sweet toast with condensed milk. Two people can share this massive thing easily. As for savory, they have their basil chicken which is delicious! The spices they use on it is so addicting!  Two things this places needs though, umbrellas for shade outside and a punch card!! Oooh! This was a nice little snack when i stopped in after work for drinks! Outside seating area. The shade is during the day, in the evening its sunny. My pup loves the water bowl outside!",1
Coffee Shop 63,"I'm always searching for a coffee shop with good vibes and a good setting.  Tea Haus definitely delivered!  Conveniently located in North Austin off of Anderson Lane, it gives us North Austin-ers a hip vibe minus the commute and traffic to get to some of the trendy central/South Austin coffee shops.  With beverage options ranging from Boba Tea, to Horchata, to one-of-a-kind coffee delights, there's something for everyone!  I opted for a Sea Salt Creme Coffee---YASSSSSSS. **Pats self on back.** It was delicious!  I also snagged a Spam Musubi --which is the only time I've ever seen one in Austin.  Being born and raise in Hawaii I think it's fair to say that I have good judgement over what is a legit musubi or not... let me tell y'all....this musubi GAVE ME LIFE!!!!! Very impressed with the quality and authentic taste.  Not to mention this is a great place to work and/or study.  The seating allows you to get comfy without going into full on slouch/slob mode (i.e. tons of couches).  I stayed in the shop working for 5 hours or so and received no side eyes or hurry-up-and-buy-something-else faces from the staff.

It has a lot of flavor and the lime gives it an extra kick. It is extremely delicious. If you're here you have to order this!  Brick Toast: A thick piece of toast doused with condensed milk and topped with fresh strawberries. Super tasty, and a perfect amount of sweetness unlike desserts that are sickening sweet. It was a really good sized portion - plenty to fulfill your sweet cravings.  Spam Musubi: It's a snack sold everywhere in Hawaii and is similar to the traditional Japanese onigiri (rice ball). It has rice + spam + nori (dried seaweed) wrapped around it and is served warm. Sounds simple but it's really tasty! The portion size isn't big, but it's a good study bite.  DRINKS:  Sea Salt Creme Coffee: Try it both iced and hot. Really great coffee!  Boba Jasmine Milk Tea: I love how you can really taste the jasmine tea. It is creamy and the boba is high quality - soft and chewy goodness. Tea Haus is probably the best place in Austin (that I know of) to get boba milk tea. I always get it with half the sugar and find that it's still sufficiently sweet.  ATMOSPHERE: Music is great and is a perfect place to study or come to chat with friends.

Anytime you come here, you see lots of people hard at work on their macbooks, like medical students and law students, for example.

Despite living across the street from Tapioca House, I make the 15 minute drive here because Tap House tastes like sewer water while Tea Haus tastes like the Nectar of the Gods.  There are many great things about this place, of which I'll highlight the friendly staff, the magazine feature-worthy interior design, and the ever-so-Instagram/Snapchat-friendly mural. As expected, the drinks are the key selling point. There is a limited menu here (don't expect the endless wall of possibilities you'd see at Tap House or Coco's), but this is for good reason: everything they put out is constantly solid.  If you are a boba purist, Tea Haus is an absolute godsend. There's really only two kinds of traditional ""milk tea"" drinks here - a black milk tea and a jasmine milk tea - but they both knock it way out of the park.  Part of the reason for this is because Tea Haus has the best pearls in all of Austin - it's a special kind of honey boba that is the perfect texture (firm, but not ice cube-like) and just the right amount of sweet. I like to go half sweet on the drinks, as the honey boba provides a really nice sweet touch you don't often get from other boba places.  The Misugaru Latte - a barley-based coffee drink - is a recent addition to the featured items menu. It's tasty and has an addicting, grainy texture. I definitely expect it to become a fixture on the permanent menu.  Like for the drinks, the food menu is short but has good options. I really like the Basil Fried Chicken in particular - although a little salty (you can ask for less salt), it is tasty and won't make you hate yourself like KFC or Popeye's would. I don't consider the Brick Toast a great value (it's just toast, condensed milk, and strawberries), but it's a good thing to try at least once!  In short: Tea Haus is holding the boba fort down for the entire city of Austin, and I'm excited to visit here for my next study trip/hangout/Wal-Mart run/boba craving!",1

Coffee Shop 63,"I got three things off of their menu: basil chicken, milk tea with tapioca, and the brick toast.  Basil Chicken: AMAZING. Possibly the best take on Taiwanese fried chicken I've ever had in Texas. It tastes pretty close to the original flavor you would get in Taiwan and the portion is pretty decent.  Milk Tea with tapioca: The best thing about their milk tea is that you can actually taste the ""tea"" part of the drink. Many places use powdered milk tea and it just doesn't taste the same. Their tapioca is the right amount of chewiness and really delicious!  Brick toast: It looks super sweet, but it's actually not! The sourness of the strawberries offsets the condensed milk drizzle and powdered sugar. The toast is really soft and has a light milky aftertaste. It also doesn't hurt that this is super Insta-worthy. Milk tea + brick toast!",1
Coffee Shop 63,"12 check-ins I first heard about this place from my sister and brother-in-law. I can't quite remember, but either the owner(s) or co-workers are/were from ACTS, which is the church that my sister and brother-in-law go to. They were raving about this place, but honestly, I was very skeptical. Coming from Houston, which has a plethora of amazing bubble tea stores, I was highly disappointed with what Austin had to offer. I suppose I had too many bad experiences with the various bubble tea stores around Austin or maybe my expectations were too high. Either way, I judged Tea Haus too quickly.  Honestly, I don't know if I would call Tea Haus a bubble tea store. I mean, as of 4/21/15, they only have one bubble tea drink and that's the classic boba milk tea. All the other drinks consist of teas and various types of coffee. With that said, I believe Tea Haus has the best milk tea in Austin and for that sole reason, I've decided to give this place 5 stars.  The store itself is also very clean and well-kept. I've never studied here, but I've seen many people do so. It seems pretty conducive to studying considering the large number of seating available and how quiet the store is.  In terms of food, Tea Haus seems to be famous for its Brick Toast and Basil Fried Chicken. The Brick Toast is basically toast topped with strawberries and condensed milk. It's AMAZING! To be completely honest, I'm not a big fan of the Basil Fried Chicken. This is probably due to the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of fried food. My friends, however, seem to love it!  If you haven't stopped by this place, I would highly recommend coming by! I can totally see this place becoming a popular place for tourists in the mere future. Boba milk tea. Boba milk tea.",1
Coffee Shop 63,"A fellow Yelper suggested this place to me. I'm not familiar with how much this area has developed! Wow.  This is a great place to work/study from. The lighting is dim, which I prefer and it's very nice, calm, and CLEAN. There's a big parking lot so that is nice also. I don't have to drive around looking for parking.  I got a Jasmine Milk Tea and it was alright, tasty but not spectacular. The Basil Fried chicken was really good though! It was flavored well and crispy.  The restroom situation is a bit weird. The sink is outside of the restroom....  If I have to be north and need to do any work, this will probably be one of my top picks!",1
Coffee Shop 63,Nice bubble tea place. Also a perfect place to hang out with friends! Hope the milk tea could be less sweet. Will try fried chicken next time! Bubble milk tea,1
Coffee Shop 63,"Basil chicken was great, really close to how they make it in Taiwan. Tea was also really good, but ours was not mixed well - cold in some spots and hot in others. Maybe just put in a little more effort there. Boba was cooked well. Nice atmosphere.",1

The Menu is a little small but its just enough, the boba tea is one of the better ones in all of austin in my opinion.  The boba is sweet and has the right amount of chew, and the tea might be a bit sweet for most people but thats how i like it. The basil fried chicken is also really good, nice and crispy but not hard crispy like most places.  definitely recommend to people if they like just the classic milk tea.",1
Coffee Shop 63,Really love their honey boba and my usual is the milk tea with regular sweetness. Their snacks such as the brick toast with strawberries and basil chicken are also good to share with friends. It's a great place to do homework which I did when I was in college.

Coffee Shop 63,"6 check-ins Listed in ATX Coffee Fix, Asian Cuisine in ATX, Sweet-ATX! ***** (5/5) Atmosphere ***** (5/5) Pricing/Quality of Food/Drinks  I rarely give out five stars on Yelp but giving these stars to Tea Haus is a no-brainer! Don't let its location at a strip mall fool you. The shop is very zen-like--I find their color scheme to be quite relaxing and a great place to catch up with a friend, or get some work done. There's also plenty of natural lighting in this shop making it a cheerful place to visit.  They have wifi but it wasn't working the day I was there *womp womp*. Luckily, I was still able to catch Which Wich's wifi signal close by.  Food: It's easy to make a decision on what to order as they have about 3-4 items to choose from from the drinks menu and about the same on the food menu as well.  Having lived in Taiwan and being Taiwanese, I'd say their milk tea with boba hit the spot. The tapioca pearls were fresh and not hard. If you don't like having too much sugar in your drinks, be sure to tell the ""barista"" you'd like to have 1/4 of the standard sugar they add. I would be happy to replace my daily cup of coffee with Tea Haus' milk tea any day. Also, looking forward to trying out their famed brick toast and basil chicken, mmm. Basil fried chicken and grapefruit green tea! Love the aesthetics of this place! Plenty of natural lighting as well",1
Coffee Shop 63,"5 check-ins They do serve other items besides tea. I know the name would be misleading but at first when I heard about Tea Haus I thought it was a boba place. But then I realize there was only one item and it's just the usual Boba Milk Tea - made with black tea and cream. But then I notice they have other coffee drinks and a little bit more tea drinks. I know I should be drinking more tea because it's healthier but I'm more of a coffee lover.  Looking at the menu, they serve affrogato (espresso with ice cream) which makes them the second place that serves affrogato. The first place which serves them is Dolce Neve. Then I have tried their basil fried chicken which was tasty. They welcome suggestions and I mention maybe adding some aioli or rice with the basil fried chicken. If don't want any coffee or tea, they do serve a green juice blend or a mint blueberry lemonade. I have tried the latter which is really fresh and a great alternative to their coffee and tea.  They have a set of armchairs in the front and some small tables in the front. When the late afternoon sun come, you may want to go to the back where it's a bit darker. The back has several long tables and 4-5 small tables.  Other items I need to try are obviously their teas, sea salted creme coffee and their simple green juice. I did speak to one of the employees who mentioned they are going to add more items to the menu soon. That would be another reason to come back and see what more treats they have in store.

Coffee Shop 63,"2 check-ins I have been searching for a sweet little coffee/ tea/ trendy/ hip hangout cafe since I've moved here. Randomly came here on a Saturday since I was in the area. I am so happy that I decided to check this place out!! The ambiance was full of college students studying which took up most of the tables (reminded me of the old days). However, there was still enough seats to go around the long tables in the back. The menu although limited on the selection of food & drinks, had some pretty solid choices. I had the the grapefruit honey green tea & the basil fried chicken nuggets! Delicious! The drink was made just right (not too sweet, just enough). The chicken was juicy and very flavorful. There were about 6-7 pieces in the order .... Probably best to share that.  In all this place is great! TH reminds me of a crossover of philz (in SF) and a taiwanese bbt shop. Will definitely come back again! Hopefully next time they will have more food options! Grapefruit honey green tea",1
Coffee Shop 63,I like this little place. Very unassuming from the outside but the drinks and snacks are great.  The boba selection is awesome and all the flavors are on point.  The Basil Chicken is simply delicious. I love that they keep the food options limited and do them well.  Plenty of seating. This is a great get together spot for sure.,1
Coffee Shop 63,"11 check-ins Sometimes, simple is better. That's what separates Tea Haus from all the other boba chains in Austin. No fancy menu with bazillion flavor options. Clean and simple. Nice!  For our first visit, we tried their Boba Milk Tea, Grapefruit Honey Green Tea, and the Brick Toast. I would seriously come back over and over again for their honey green tea! The brick toast was great but in the end, it's still just a giant piece of toast with condense milk poured over it. Not worth $6. Cool place to hangout overall and we would certainly come back to try out the other items on their simple menu. brick toast",1
Coffee Shop 63,"2 check-ins Listed in Places to Revisit! I absolutely adore this place! I love the atmosphere and the staff who work here. The first time I came, one of the workers took the time to explain everything to me step by step asking for my preferences and giving me suggestions about what I might like. And the second time I came, he actually remembered me, even though it was days later.  I always order their brick toast and the sea salt creme coffee. I actually don't like sweet coffee, and actually take my coffee black, but this coffee makes me want to get up in the morning (And if you know me, that means a lot, cuz I am NOT a morning person). According to the worker, a lot of people order the coffee cold, but I prefer my drinks warm especially when drinking it with toast. I think these two complement each other well, and it's definitely a place I will return to if I am ever craving sweet coffee and some quiet time to myself or with friends. Take my word for it, and come try their food. It will not disappoint you! Brick toast",1

I also got to try their basil fried chicken today, and it is amazing. These fried chicken bites actually taste like the street food in Taiwan - hot, fresh, with a flavorful fry (squeeze the lime on top: lime + basil combination is a winner), and juicy, tender, melt-in-your-mouth white meat chicken. The chicken itself is still delicious and not overpowered by the flavor of the fry. Love it.

Coffee Shop 63,"Listed in Boba-palooza As if the German-esque name didn't suggest it, Tea Haus is possibly one of the most hipster and trendy tea shops I have been, making this a cool place to study and hang out. Sadly despite its name, the tea was not unfortunately up to expectation.  Boasting organic choices, Tea Haus's menu is limited compared to the usually big selections at typical boba places to focus on quality over quantity. As a huge boba, my first instinct was to order the classic tapioca milk tea ($3.15 with tax for regular 20 oz) and at first taste, it was delicious! The boba was also fresh too judging from its texture and has a light honey undertone, but the amount of boba in a cup was rather small. After finishing the tea, I also became more thirsty afterwards - not a good sign since it is usually an indication of too much creamer powder.  However, just when I was disappointed with the tea, the basil chicken brought this place back to me! Other places, either in America or Taiwan, sell fried basil chicken in small meat chunks that are often dry, but Tea Haus's basil chicken was huge in juicy chunks. Along with the classic Taiwanese fried chicken seasoning, the basil made the lightly battered chicken even more irresistible. For $5.95, you can get a nice portion of perhaps one of the best Taiwanese fried chicken in America and Taiwan I had.  Overall, although the milk tea was rather disappointing, the basil chicken was enough to make me revisit again. Because there are so many tables in here that finding a seat is usually not a problem even with a huge crowd, I can't wait for the next time I return to work or meet up friends over the stellar basil chicken.  --- tl;dr version: 1) Hipster and trendy tea shop perfect for work and hangout 2) Disappointing boba milk tea 3) Phenomenal basil-enhanced Taiwanese fried chicken",1
Coffee Shop 63,"This is seriously my favorite bubble tea in Austin.  The boba tastes fresh, the tea tastes divine, and the service is awesome. It's clean and pretty on the inside if you're coming on a date or have friends who are picky about ambiance. Also - If you haven't tried the fried chicken here - do it. You won't regret it! Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the toast (it was a thick piece of bread with condensed milk and admittedly delicious strawberries), but many of my friends loved it, so I think it depends on your taste.  I'd say the only true downside for me here is that they don't have sugar substitutes. As a diabetic type 1, I usually just end up getting my tea without any sweetener. This is fine - but a few more options for sweetness issues would make it top notch, for me.  Also, if you're with someone who likes a lot of choices with bubble tea flavors, the selection here is limited but solid. Definitely a different feel than Cocos or Teapioca.",1

Coffee Shop 63,"Been dreaming about that melt-in-your-mouth basil fried chicken...and I've never been to Tea Haus until today.  I got the succulent basil fried chicken (about 10 pieces, 1/2 lb) seasoned with their magic spices and basil leaves, along with a small piece of lime. The chicken was scalding hot when I first bit into it and exploded with juiciness and flavor. BUT in hindsight, I wish they gave me more than a tiny slice of lime that only had enough juice to spread over like 2 pieces of chicken. I bet there'd be even more flavor if I had more lime. Oh, and I also got the mint-blueberry lemonade. I was looking for something sour and sweet to balance out the saltiness of the fried chicken. Refreshing and tangy lemonade!  I will definitely be back next time to try some of their other lemonades and the milk tea!",1

Coffee Shop 63,"Was suggested this place by an Austin resident for boba.  Got the milk tea -black tea with cream & honey boba $2.95 and the sea salt cream coffee - americano coffee with whipped sea salt cream $3.65.  I do like the honey boba.  The sea salt coffee tasted a  like watered down coffee.  Not too bad, but not good either.  So both drinks were a bit ""bland.""  Also ordered the brick toast $5.95 --which was Texas toast with condensed milk, powdered sugar, and strawberries.  It was good, but I was a bit disappointed as it's something I can make at home (kinda).  Ordering process gets messy and confusing as it was loud & busy when we went--- names got called... people not paying attention, grabbing other people's drinks, etc. etc.  Then we didn't know our brick toast order pickup was in the back (cashier didn't tell us).  We were craving boba tea again the next day but both didn't want to go back to Tea Haus.  Guess it didn't wow us. Brick toast Brick toast milk tea w/ honey boba",0
Coffee Shop 63,"14 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black, Asians are warm & fuzzy all over..., ""Oppan Boba Style!"" The fun thing about Tea Haus is figuring out what they're trying to be: A trendster coffeehouse with Boba tea? A chic industrial-tech juice bar with Basil Fried Chicken? I think I'm a fan just because they're cool.  It's in soft opening, they're still tweaking, and I'm not even sure what their current hours are. But the staff is wonderful, they're excited about being here, and everything else will work itself out. When Yvonne the manager asked how my straight black Summermoon drip was, I said it was a tad weak for me, and we started talking about Austin's coffee roasters while doing espresso & matcha shots. And those were great. Incidentally, if you need a carb rush, try their Brick Toast.  It occurs to me this section of Anderson Lane between Burnet & MoPac has just about everything you need in life, and all highly regarded by Yelpers who come around here. Movies, restaurants, bars, acupuncture, Petticoat Fair, and apparently one cool dentist. Tea Haus is the newest kid on the block, and in perfect company. Very Zen. Oh, if you look closely, ""Dave"" is the name I use whenever I order Boba Milk Tea. It's just easier all around at different places. Okay, sometimes I take pics of my coffee cup.

If you want to be productive, come around late afternoon/early evening, because around 8:30 pm hordes of people started flooding in and taking turns posing by the cool artsy poem snippet shindig on the wall.  For drinks, I got the grapefruit green tea. This drink featured a deliciously fragrant green tea (I really loved it) with grapefruit syrup and a bit of fruit pulp. I would have preferred more natural flavors and more pulp--perhaps a splash of grapefruit juice--but the overall concoction was very refreshing. My boyfriend's jasmine milk tea boba was not sweet at all, surprisingly--lots of jasmine flavor and less cream. And this was a regular sweet level, so I wonder what half sweet tastes like.

Coffee Shop 63,"8 check-ins I was here a week ago, and I really wanted to try it based off of friends' reviews of this place. This is the ONLY place where I have enjoyed drinking milk tea. I'm usually not a fan of it and I will drink it only if it is offered, but that doesn't apply here. The milk tea has the perfect level of sweetness and there was just the right amount of boba. I tried some of my friend's sea salt creme coffee and he said it was like Starbucks's white mocha. But better. I don't know how Starbucks's white mocha tastes, but regardless, this drink was yummy.  The basil fried chicken was awesome. Literally the best I've had. It was enough to share with a friend and I loved the presentation of it.

Mint mojito iced coffee - I had to ask them to remake it with half the sugar because it was way too sweet as is. The staff is very accommodating and instantly made me another one :) If you like a lot of cream in your coffee, then go for this one. I personally didn't care for the coated layer on the roof of my mouth after a few sips.

This is kind of weird, but I like there bathroom situation. There is only one co-ed bathroom, and what I like is that they have the sinks outside. This is smart because if there was a line, it makes it go faster. Also, I think that having the sinks outside encourages hand-washing because people can see you (for all the gross people out there who don't wash their hands lol)  The staff are always so friendly and helpful. I am super indecisive and take forever to decide what I finally want, and they really helped me pick what to get without rushing me. Shout out to Natasha for being amazing and so genuine. She really helped make the best decision ever to get the sea salt cream coffee. That stuff is dangerous. Pretty sure I down that drink way too fast. Also, the milk tea is pretty bomb, and the bobas/bubbles in it have a really good consistency and texture. The grapefruit green tea was okay. I think I should try it again with less sweetener, so I don't want to set my judgement on it just yet. The basil chicken is so worth it guys. I got it after being full from eating hopdoddys across the street, and it was still amazing. The subtle basil flavor is perfect, and I like how it's a lot of meat and not just thick pieces of batter. Speaking of meat, the chicken is not dry, but is super tender/juicy.  Definitely want to come back and try out the other drinks and food, especially the brick toast.  [update]  Okay guys I literally came back in less than 24 hours lol the brick toast is so yummy! The bread is lightly toasted to create a slight crunch on the outside, and the inside is like soft, fluffy clouds. The strawberries are fresh and taste so good with the bread.

Coffee Shop 63,"I have been here a few times since it opened and have been pleased. Usually when I go to a boba place, I get a flavored tea (like a blueberry green or strawberry green) with some jellies or tapioca and call it a day. This was different as they specialize in milk tea. I figured, why not, good to try new things. I must say, it was pretty awesome.  While this isn't the type of place you'd come to for a meal, you can get snacks in the form of the basil fried chicken and brick toast.

I couldn't even spot the teepee everyone so lovingly speaks of.  Beyond that disappointment, this place is pretty nice.

The service couldn't have been friendlier as I perused their fascinating items. What I liked most about the display is that it wasn't overwhelming and wasn't busting at the seams with too much stuff. Everything had it's place as to let every piece command your attention and not get lost in the shuffle.  They also have local events like Art Pop Ups and fun happy hours boasting local beer and spirits, workshops, and more that I hope to check out in the near future!",1
Coffee Shop 27,All the vintage here is hand selected and well picked! Austin is lucky to have such a visionary and hard-working friend in a small business neighbor like Jill.,1
Coffee Shop 27,"Jackie offered wonderful service to me this morning, so inviting and social. She is the best! I ordered a cortado with a hint of lavender and vanilla( so delicious) stump town coffee is a fantastic roaster!!! In addition I met Jill when I went to explore the retail section to the location! Friends and Neighbors offers a variety of vintage clothing along with fun trinkets and jewelry  LOVE LOVE LOVE",1
Coffee Shop 27,"Ummm the parking situation kind of sucks and they no longer offer MALK-nut milks BUT the vegan double chocolate muffin is AMAZING!!!!!!! It's very generous in size and reasonably priced. I honestly don't believe it's vegan because it's so decadent lol. I also purchased a iced mocha w/ almond milk  yes, yes AND YES! It's the perfect balance even if your ice melts, the coffee is strong yet smooth I mean basically it's great go check it out",1
Coffee Shop 27,"This rustic and airy house of vintage duds gets five stars for vibe (no pushy/fake sales people or blaring pop music), nice spacious arrangement of the clothing, convenience of the coffee shop in back and a few off-street parking spaces. Five stars for my selling experience with Jill the owner, who was very selective but gave me decent prices for my loot! One star off for not having a wider variety, because I'm not a vintage/hippie fashion hound, but I'm putting that star back up for those who are: this place is focused on you.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"Uncorporate. My favorite type of hangout place. Not only a little boutique, but also a coffee shop.  Bring a group of girls for drinks and hangout in the back yard. Board games if you're board. Cool Beans is parked there and they have literally the best charro beans ever.",1
Coffee Shop 27,The coolest kids in town. The cappuccino was totally on point and that barista fella was pretty easy on the eyes. Will be back soon.,1
Coffee Shop 27,"This place is as hipster as they come, but damn do they brew a good cup!  From the outdoor teepee to the ($$$$) handmade goods sold inside, this place has it all in terms of creative-class, ""free spirit"" millennial desires.    But at the end of the day, it's a darn cute spot to crank out some work, and the baristas really know their stuff. They even carry *local* *handmade* *artisan* *homegrown* *ethical* *vegan* nut milks, including pecan milk, which was admittedly a delicious first for me.  If this sounds like your kind of thing, definitely give this place a go. And if not, I still think it's worth a try.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"I love this little gem on the east side. Great coffee, great micheladas and beautiful back yard (including teepee). They have the cutest array of clothes and accessories, some decor and records, and also delicious jams, bloody mary mixes and other artisinal grocery things. Just too cute Planning trips while sipping on fire eagle and micheladas",1
Coffee Shop 27,"Um...so this place rocks. It's a coffee shop/boutique/home goods/hipster hangout/all good things wrapped up in one tiny house on east Caesar Chavez.  I'm so glad I read about this place on Austin Chronicle because it was a great find! There is jewelry and clothing for sale as well as unique foodie items you would find in someplace like Brooklyn or Ballard in Seattle. They have vegan treats, traditional coffee drinks, wine, and my favorite...shrubs! I understand that not everyone enjoys drinking vinegars, but if you want to venture into the unknown and delicious, try their prickly pear shrub. It's the perfect balance of sweet and tangy topped off with some classic Topo. There is ample seating out back, a small stage, free Wi-fi, and a teepee!  I'm definitely hitting up this place again and am so glad they joined the neighborhood. Prickly Pear Shrub",1
Coffee Shop 27,"This is a pretty awesome place. Pretty far east on Cesar Chavez but worth the drive. One, they have Stumptown Coffee. Two, it's a really chill outdoor seating area. Three, vendors. They allow vendors to sell their wares outside and the shop itself doubles as a sort of a store. This place is just really chill. I highly recommend visiting it, having some coffee, and taking in the sun!",1
Coffee Shop 27,"I think this place lives up to its name...Friends & Neighbors.  It is a cool little house located in one of the city's latest hot spots, East Caeser Chavez aka East 1st.  It is a place to hang, have some coffee or a beverage, eat some pretty good vegan Tex Mex, chat, chill, play a game or peruse their vintage clothing and other trinkets on display and for sale.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"Shopping, vintage clothes, food truck for snacks, coffee bar, HH from 3-6P? This place has everything I need for one nice afternoon/evening.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"3 check-ins This would be a solid 5 stars, but I have to deduct a star for the terrifying swarm of mosquitoes that recently decided to hang out on the back patio. (Seriously guys, I love you, but please quadruple the citronella candles on the porch so I can come back?!)  Criticism aside, let's talk about F&N, which is a fantastic place. First off, there's quirky groceries from Brooklyn and other-such hip places. Think: artisinal jams/sauces, and a few other options. They'll cost a bit, but you won't be able to find the things that they have anywhere else in town. The same seems to go for the clothes, which are very stylish, but also expensive and less common around town. Really, everything is trendy and stylish, and the space itself is just cute.  Outside they have a tepee that's pretty artistic, and a few bright, metallic pinatas. They serve fancy coffee, a few decent wines, and mimosas. If you'd like a pastry, they can do that as well. Beneath the funky items, ""indie aesthetic,"" and home-y decor - there's this feel-good-warm-fuzzy-vibey undercurrent that keeps us coming back. We don't know what it is, but we like it.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"Beautiful! I feel comfortable, at ease here. Play a game, eat good food, get some work done, wonderful.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"This place is adorable! It's tucked away on E. Ceasar Chavez where only the cool kids know about it. For now... Given that Austinites love their outdoor seating, this place is the perfect spot to sip on a cup of Joe or a mimosa and enjoy the nostalgic feel of the backyard area (complete with T-Pee)!  In the front of this quaint little house turned shop, you'll find a mixture of vintage clothing with modern, sustainable pieces mixed in. They even have some cool jewelry and other trinkets handmade in Brooklyn and shipped here.  In the back of the shop you can quench your thirst or hunger by choosing from a moderate drink and snack menu. There's a counter that seats about 4-5 people, so don't expect to find a seat inside if it's unfriendly weather conditions.  If you don't follow them on instagram, you should. And check this place out before it becomes over run with tourists! The people are friendly and the conversations are lively.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"Met a friend here this morning and just fell in love with the place. Coffee was excellent! Friendly staff [gave me a free donut hole... :)]. They have a huge outdoor area that's great for kids or a big group. Very quaint.  I was confused at first because there's two doors on the front, neither are to the coffee shop, which is located around the back. Also just good to know - there isn't indoor seating, so it got a little hot drinking coffee outside.  This place is ideal for grabbing a cup on your way somewhere. Delicious coffee, hidden away, no crowds.",1
Coffee Shop 27,"WARNING!! The WORST PLACE IN AUSTIN. UNfriendly !!!! the girl who is selling retail is AWFUL!!! Super UNfriendly acts like she is doing YOU a favor by letting you in her ""store"" you'd do better by going to a garage sale in the pouring rain than shop here. TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR ATTITUDE. The girl at the coffee / snack section was pretty cool but not cool enough to out shine the black cloud that lurkes in the retail section. YUCK ! NEVER going back.",0
Coffee Shop 27,"One of my favorite places to have a cup of joe and relax with my dog!!! I love the teepee and the owner and barista are the shit!!! I bring all my friends, local and foreign here on a regular basis and they never let me down!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 27,"7 check-ins Austinites have shown, time and time again, that they love a good hole-in-the-wall. The less people know about it, the better. Friends & Neighbors, being basically brand new, is definitely the definition of a hole-in-the-wall but there is no way that a place like this can remain a secret for that much longer.  It is a little confusing at first. When you drive down Cesar Chavez, you are apt to see a bunch of businesses all with vague names and looking like houses. You tell yourself that you want to see what they are, but then you forget. Friends & Neighbors is a house (look for the green and pink arrows pointing at it) featuring a clothing store in the front and a coffeehouse in the back. The backyard area has four big pecan trees for shade, and the owners there do everything in their power to keep the mosquitoes off of you.    The owners are the same people who own Hillside Pharmacy, and they have a taste for nice things. Stumptown Coffee highlights the menu, as well as a rotating selection of organic pastries. They also make a mean lemonade as well as an Italian cream soda.  My favorite flavor combination? Strawberry and peach.  One cannot help wonder if they might be better suited with doing away with the clothing section, and converting that part of the quaint house into indoor seating. Look into any coffeehouse in Austin and what will you find? Hipsters typing on their Macs. I feel like this place would truly excel with indoor seating, especially in the winter when people are not going to want to sit outside, but will still want hot coffee.  Also, any place that hosts both a puppet show or a Mariokart N64 tournament is automatically awesome.",1
Coffee Shop 27,Walked in and really enjoyed the cokespresso. I'm not sure why I've never had this. We had just gotten in from our flight and things still seemed to be starting up in Austin. Not exactly a central location but if you're in the area it's certainly worth checking out. The breakfast tacos they serve also do quite the job for an early morning snack.,1
Coffee Shop 27,"Amazing amazing!! Inspiring! What's with Austin and their amazing cafes?? Vancouver needs to get on this approachable, homey cafe vibe. This place is incredible. Not a commercial space but an old house converted to feature a home tastefully decorated and filled with local, artisan, and a selection of vintage goods, art zines and local photography on the walls.. pretty much my favourite kind of space. The bar is, fittingly, in the kitchen, our barista was hilarious, and we came by on the perfect day to sit outside at one of the shaded picnic tables and take our time enjoying the experience. Try the cokespresso. Follow their instagram & go to their events so I can live vicariously through you. Love spots with such a focus on community. Woo!",1
Coffee Shop 27,"This place is wonderful and special. If you need to get out of the house, but don't want your typical coffee shop, are craving a bite to eat (but not a full meal), a bit of art, this place fits that bill. The manager was really nice. He said hello to my dog and brought him a treat! He makes all the shrub drinks that are FANTASTIC and will mix it with cava for a sparkling delight. The pork rillette was rich and satisfying. I will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 27,"First to Review Love, Love, LOVE this new neighborhood coffee shop.  Added bonus, they also have high quality retail items under the same roof.  Awesome staff, great spot!  Check for events as they host live music in their backyard.  Support local!",1
Coffee Shop 27,"This is now one of my favorite places in Austin. So charming.  Browse/buy some truly fashionable vintage clothes, beautiful handmade jewelry, beauty products or housewares! Drink a coffee, nosh on a gourmet donut, buy some delicious snacks to go! Check out the teepee, sit in the shady backyard or on the porch! Chat with the staff!  It's a retail store and cafe in an old house, and it feels like somewhere you'd want to (and be allowed to) hang out for days.",1
Coffee Shop 27,This is a really lovely place.  Good outdoor area and surprisingly easy parking situation (you can exit out the back and not onto cesar chavez.  Wish they had a discount price for iced coffee refills but that's a small complaint.  Highly recommended.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"I'm trying not to make coming here an everyday habit, but this place is making it really difficult! It's right across the street from my work so I end up here a couple times a week. The BEST lattes. They have a wide variety of unique drinks and flavors. I've also tried their banana bread and it was amazing. They're always very helpful and offer suggestions if you're not sure what to get.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"I like this place! Friendly staff and good options.  Their coffee isn't spectacular in my opinion, but it's not bad. Definitely worth checking out.  Pros: friendly staff plenty of variety Offers food Drive thru available Affordable coffee & treats  Cons: Coffee isn't spectacular (personal opinion) ONLY drive thru, so if you're looking to sit down in a cafe, save this stop for ""to-go"" trips",1
Coffee Shop 59,"I live next door to Sorrento's and it is really hard not to come every day. I think they use real cream in their blended drinks and they are SO so So good. They sell THE BEST kolaches (Kolache Creations), and their breakfast tacos are TacoDeli. See why I can't go every day?  I normally get the iced toddy, sometimes it's delicious and perfect, and sometimes it tastes like regular iced coffee (cold but burnt). Regardless, it's usually better than the green monster down the street. The only other thing is that I wish they would consider using different beans though, because whatever they use is a little sour when you don't get it with cream!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"This place is exactly what I need. I don't want to drink shite Starbuck's coffee, but with two babies I must have a drive thru.  So, here is Sorrento's, I've driven by it 574 times and finally stopped. The coffee was good, the barista offered a rewards deal which is awesome, asked if I wanted animal crackers for my toddler, and had dog bones for my dog.  When I'm on my own this is the place I'll be stopping for coffee. They had a pretty extensive drink menu that I'll certainly be checking out as time goes on.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Best little coffee house. So cute and always friendly staff. Love the lattes and the have taco deli tacos too.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Tasty coffee and cheaper prices than the mermaid brand. I love that this is a little house turned coffee shop. However, when placing my order, I'm usually made to feel like I'm inconveniencing the employees. Not a great take on customer service for a small business. I look forward to going back and hopefully being greeted with some smiling faces!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"31 check-ins Great coffee, great service.  It is a drive thru, but such great staff people like Fawn is reason alone to keep coming back.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Stopped in here the other day while the family was out and about. Oh dear. In a few words....  Delicious, friendly, handmade, LOCAL. We all ended up loving this place.  They serve Ruta Maya coffee (which is my favorite), so I was especially happy about that. They make banana bread (omg it is SO incredibly delicious). Zucchini bread, cookies (the chocolate chip is amazing), breakfast sandwiches/croissants, they also serve Taco deli tacos.   Everyone was extremely friendly and the food they bake is mouthwatering.  We ordered 2 coffees, 1 hot chocolate, 2 chocolate chip cookies, 1 Banana bread.  The bread is incredible.  We wanted a loaf, but by the time we went back, they were closed.  That's ok.  We will be back.  Great location for us, too.  Not too far out of the way.  Prices are extremely modest for so many organic, local, and handmade items.  Love this little joint!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but if I was I could see myself coming here pretty often. It's a little shack in the middle of a parking lot. Park and walk up to the window or use the drive-thru. Cute.  There was only one person working there when I went on a Sunday morning, so it can take a few minutes to get your order. But when I took my first sip of my iced chai latte, I was like ""dayum, that's good"". It was so delicious and flavorful, with just the right amount of sweet and spice. I'm smitten.  They have a good selection of drinks and a ton of flavored syrups if you're into that. They also have food: a variety of pastries and a few TacoDeli tacos. I haven't tried any from here but if I wanted to spoil myself with some breakfast on the go, I now know to come back.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Great Coffee!  I have always loved this place.  Super easy to get in and out and you don't have to wait 20 minutes like the Starbucks up the street!,1
Coffee Shop 59,Great coffee fast service.. it is an easy way to shop local and a great alternative to the much more expensive Starbucks,1
Coffee Shop 59,"I opened a new office nearby and this is my go-to place for breakfast tacos, coffee, and emergency snacks. The service is always great, they have my favorite treats, the coffee is stellar, and they even have coconut and almond milk and stevia. And I don't even have to leave my car! I will always, always choose the local coffee peddler over Starbucks and this place kicks ass!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Wow, I just left this place, took a drink of my Americano, and pulled my car over to write this review. I've lived in north Austin my entire life and have never been here. This coffee just changed my life, the roast is to die for, it blew me away. I'll never, ever, go to a Starbucks again. Rock on guys, you're doing it right! You just gained a lifer.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Absolutely delicious.  We were use to going across the street to the big name place but was lead here by accident.  So happy! Prices are about  30% cheaper.  Service was good for such a small place.  Time is pretty quick.,1
Coffee Shop 59,I've driven by this place many many times as my mother in law lives in the area and I finally stopped by.  I ordered what I normally get at other coffee shops. I got a large and was very surprised on the size of the beverage! You can definitely get larger coffees than most places and still be comparable in price to others!  I enjoyed my coffee and I'm hoping to try this place again.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Pretty cool - a drive thru coffee joint. But runs out of breakfast tacos pretty early. She said they usually take down the sign when they run out, but today we waited ten min in drive thru to find out they were out :/ (the tacos are from taco deli; $2.60)",1
Coffee Shop 59,"I have been to this location twice. Today I ordered an iced, dirty chai latte and a sausage jalapeño cheese kolachi. Both were delicious and served up quickly by a very friendly lady. If I'm in the area and need caffeine, I'll stop here to get it.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Love love love this place! I work right across the street from this little shack and I usually make a pit stop before I head in to work. The employees are always so sweet. My faves from here are the iced Americano and the iced chai tea. The prices are very reasonable and the service is quick. A helpful tip: if there is a long line for the drive thru, I would recommend ordering at the window. Service is much faster that way. They also serve breakfast tacos from Casa Chapala, and other muffins and pastries. Also, they have a membership and if you sign up you receive your 10th drink free. You just need to let them know when you order your drink that you are a member so they can notate your membership in their system. If you're in the area and would like a quick pick me up on the go, this is your ideal place!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Love these guys. The coffee is good. They'll remember your order. If you've got a dog, they'll have dog biscuits, and if you've got a kiddo, they'll have animal crackers. It's the little things, y'all.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"I love this place. I love my girls! The baristas here are on point and handle a busy day with grace. I have never gotten a wrong order, or bad drinks here. They are quick with good recommendations once they know you and your style of caffeine intake. Join the coffee club and if you're a fiend like me you get a free coffee about every week and a half. I can not say enough good things about this little coffee gem.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"19 check-ins Listed in Thanks a latte! This adorable coffee shop is perfectly located across from one of the busiest Starbucks locations in my area. I started frequenting this shop when I moved from south Austin to north central Austin, and decided to expand my horizons. The lattes are amazing and I love how easy and non-intimidating their menu is. Although I do feel the customer service has varied over the years, I am pleased with how quickly this shop can knock out those orders. I tend to only swing by on my late mornings, as I sometimes open up shop before the sunrise and have been told that they get their breakfast tacos in a little later than I was hoping for. This girl doesn't wait around for her tacos. That being said, if you are looking for a quality cup of coffee with some Austin charm that still holds true to the easy menu of a chain coffee house, Sorrento's has it all.",1
Coffee Shop 59,5 check-ins This place is great! It's such a better alternative than Starbucks which usually has a line out the parking lot at 8am so I'll choose Sorrento's over that any day! It also has a walk up option but I usually just get in the car line. It's never too long of a wait. I usually get green tea and honey with one of their muffin-whiches (sausage or bacon) and it's pretty good. I definitely recommend going here!,1
Coffee Shop 59,LOVE this place! Great local business!  Rad chicks work there and they have a coffee club like another chain coffee shop we all know.  I grabbed a large iced coffee for work tonight and it's HUGE! I'm totally ok with that though! Also the chocolate chip cookie was pretty much just like my moms so there's that as an added bonus!  Pretty sure I found my new coffee spot on this side of town! A large iced coffee is bigger than a pint glass at work! I like it!,1
Coffee Shop 59,"2 check-ins ""Black Magic"" is a hit.  The perfect of blackberry, kahlua, baileys and espresso, I believe.  The baristas are friendly and professional.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Great coffee and friendly staff! Cute to boot! Prices are good and the coffee is always Hot.  Not many options in the hood here but a great locally owned spot. Better than Starbucks for sure.,1
Coffee Shop 59,Great place!  I got the Toasted Almond latte last time.  Yum!  Friendly barista.  Definitely swing by to get your caffeine fix if you're in the neighborhood.,1
Coffee Shop 59,Such a fun little stand with the sweetest people! I've never encountered a line here or long wait. Can expect the same quality that you would receive at any local shop and love how convenient it is! Almond poppyseed muffins are great and liked their chai!,1
Coffee Shop 59,"44 check-ins I love this place. It's local, inexpensive, and the workers are always friendly and sweet. There is a walk up window on the opposite side of the drive through, and that's a good option if the line is long. Make sure you join the Coffee Club, which gets you one free coffee after you buy 12. Breakfast tacos are available from casa chapala (across the street), but they usually run out around 9 or 10. Great coffee, great people. Skip the Starbucks down the street and try this cute little hut.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"This place is incredible! The two amazing women who work here make the best coffee I've ever had. Unfortunately, one has moved on to bigger and better things, but the quality of coffee and customer service is still great! Definitely recommend checking this place out instead of going to Starbucks. Shop local! And the butter pecan latte is on point.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Espressocino is creamier and smoother than a Starbucks frappucino.  Toddy can be sour sometimes.  Join the card club for a free drink.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Reasonable price, good coffee. Got a white chocolate caffeccino (their version of a frappuccino), and it's delicious. I was looking for a Starbucks when I found this place, and I like it better. A little cheaper too! And it has that small-coffee-stand charm that places like Starbucks lack. Just wish it was closer to my house!  (Note: If you can't tell from the photos, there's no indoor seating. Good coffee, but don't come here to do your homework.) Halfway done with my grande white chocolate caffeccino, and it's delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"6 check-ins I tried the Iced Toddy here which is a coffee ""drip-brewed overnight"".  It is REALLY strong so when they asked me ""would you like milk and sugar"" I said yes and I didn't regret it.  The thing that is interesting about this coffee, though is the fact that it is so strong yet not bitter for what it is!  The flavor is a bit acidic but quite pleasant.  It definitely has less of the ""nutty"" flavor but I really enjoyed it.  My wife tried the hot chocolate steamer with toasted marshmallow syrup and it was just ok.  The chocolate flavor was very minimal but we just figured it must be due to the ""steamer"" part of it all so... so be it!  If you like a strong cup of iced coffee with barely any bitterness then try the iced toddy!  *thumbs up Iced Toddy with cream and sugar / hot chocolate with toasted marshmallow syrup",1
Coffee Shop 59,This place has friendly fast service and is wonderful I have no idea why so many people are going to the Starbucks across the street it's on the corner of Anderson and Shoalcreek and it is amazing that even give your little kiddos free graham crackers and there are free doggie biscuits for your puppies,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Breakfast taco was exquisite. The staff was very friendly and didn't mind answering a few of my questions. The coffee was a little bland, but I requested minimal syrups. All in all fantastic and I would definitely return!",1
Coffee Shop 59,The drinks I've had over the years are always delicious! Their hot chai and iced coffee are my favorite.,1
Coffee Shop 59,Really tasty lattes.  Nothing like a little caffeine to keep you going through the day!,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Nice, convenient little coffee place right on the corner. Headed up north for a class and was actually looking for that St$&?@!$& place when I stumbled upon this. And I'm glad I did. There was absolutely no wait, and the girls were super friendly. This is a delicious soy latte too!!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Dropped by this place for the first time today (needed caffeine and was debating between Starbucks and trying something new).  Best decision ever.  First of all, the customer service was fantastic (I asked for a cup of water, and they gave me a huge glass of ice water--no charge; they also spent time going over menu options and didn't look annoyed when I asked questions...super friendly).  I went out on a limb and ordered the Toddy, which was delicious (and I am a bit of a coffee snob--only do Starbucks for the convenience).  Great nutty flavor with smooth taste.  Loved this place and will be back whenever I'm in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"The Chai Latte made me do it!  I rarely post, but this was a great Chai Latte with nice, warm and fast service to boot.  The Chai was so tasty that I wondered if they were literally making a different beverage than all of the people who serve Chai's make!  Looking forward to coming back for breakfast tacos and other drinks...Nice work, Sorrento's!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Not a huge fan of Starbucks quality coffee (too burnt-tasting), so started venturing out to local coffee places.  I had driven by this place so many times without a second thought, but I'm so glad I stopped this time around.  I ordered a double shot cappuccino with soy milk--they have so many non-dairy alternatives (soy/almond/coconut) for people with dairy allergies/intolerances.  My drink is actually very tasty and delicious. The coffee is well-rounded and the price wasn't too bad either. It actually tastes like coffee (robust and strong), and I STRONGLY recommend this cute little local shop.  Other things you should know: they have a very extensive menu, and per the woman who helped me, they have great Chai and delicious blended drinks (like frapps from Starbucks).",1
Coffee Shop 59,"My only regret in writing this review is that I can't give them more stars. This quaint little coffeeshop is the absolute epitome of what a coffeeshop should be, in my humble opinion.  First of all, nothing is worse than a crabby barista when you are sleep and caffeine deprived. I have NEVER had that problem here. There are three girls that I see throughout my work week that are the sweetest, most competent little lovelies ever. They remember my name, and never show any exasperation when I ask for my ten to twenty word coffee-drink, even if they have a line of cars behind me. Having worked as a barista for Starbucks when I was in college, I know how frustrating people like me can be when you are busy! There is nothing better with coffee in the early hours than a genuine smile. Thanks ladies.  Secondly, this lil gem has basically every dairy alternative a lactose-intolerant could hope for. Once, they had run out of almond milk, so I tried coconut milk for the first time and was blown away. Their variety of flavors and products are superb and their pastries and tacos are fresh and seriously, you can taste that they are made with love.  Overall, this is my absolute favorite coffee spot in Austin, even if their little cottage  isn't quite big enough yet for me to squeeze into with my work laptop. :)  Keep up the great work!  Also their coffee club is great! You just give them your name and they give you a free coffee every ten cups of joe!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Starbucks is overpriced and weak.  Sorrento's has an Iced Cold Brewed coffee, and it is very good. That's all I've had on the menu. 32 oz and very strong.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Affordable,  fast, delicious,  and local. How could you go wrong! If you haven't tried this place... you totally should!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Awesome customer service even at the ripe hour of 6am.  I frequently come to Sorrento's before work or during my lunch break to get a caffeine fix from their tasty coffee.  Lattes are yummy as is a plain ole cup of joe.  The staff are great about preparing a simple coffee exactly the way you like.  It's magic, they must be mind readers to get it so right each time.  Thank you for being there for me, Sorrento's, on those dark, lonely, early mornings.",1
Coffee Shop 59,I stumbled upon this quaint little coffee house in an early morning sleep deprived state. A chipper young lady with a warm smile took my order & made my 32oz dirty chai perfectly. I haven't gone anywhere else since I found this little gem. Keep up the good work ladies! (And maybe teach the crabby guy that works there how to smile:),1
Coffee Shop 59,"Very convenient, always fresh, great customer service! Tacos are good too. If you get a chance and want something sweet and cold must try the milkshakes they are the best. Great experience",1
Coffee Shop 59,great prices and good drinks and food. also. locally owned. pretty quick drive through and very nice staff.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Red bull Italian sodas... my favorite!  I had a few friends from Houston come visit and we were just cruising down Anderson when suddenly we had the urge for caffeine.  Pulled up my trusty yelp app on the iPhone and was able to locate this nice little spot. Emphasis on little as it looks like a tiny house.  In any case, we pulled up and were greeting by a bird seed feeder turned tip jar guarded by a plastic army toy and your personal sense of honor and integrity.  Waited a few moments before we were greeted and were given great suggestions. I ignored them all when I saw the red bull italian soda.  Got it in Green Apple and was very happy. Everyone else ordered other stuff but everyone else also wanted to sip my drink...  Yeah. Life was good after that day.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Across the hills and over the mountains, past the point where the vale of Spicewood transforms into the trails of West Anderson, there lies a tiny little espresso stop that I can't live without.  Sorrento's shack-sized establishment offers walk-up service, but it's the drive thru that most everyone uses. Quick, friendly service awaits - this is one location that radiates that special blend of Austin charm.  But their coffee is anything but weird - it's tasty, affordable, and available in a ridiculous number of styles. I'm a traditionalist, so it's usually an au lait or a latte for me. Rare is the day that I can resist the call of the Gigante-sized cup: It's twice as much coffee as you'd get for the same price in a national chain.  Feeling peckish? There's a ton of food available here, too. A working morning will see me picking up a taco or some biscotti. On a weekend, I'll splurge on a blueberry muffin.  Sorrento's is convenient, affordable, and delicious. Shop local, play hard, love one another, drink coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee A friend and I dropped in to Sorrento's Coffee for some quick iced mochas and were not disappointed. The barista was nice, and made both of our drinks pretty quickly. She also knew how to make a mocha correctly, which sadly is not a skill that a lot of people who live outside the Northwest, (where I am from) actually know. I am usually really disappointed with coffee drinks, but I was very pleasantly surprised here. Both iced mochas were really good, and not knock-your-socks-off strong for double shots, but had great coffee flavor. I would definitely go here again. Thanks!",1
Coffee Shop 59,I was in the area and had a choice between Starbucks or the cute little coffee drive thru. Decided to try this spot and was the best choice!! I ordered a chai tea latte. The girl at the drive thru made it perfect and customer service was excellent!!!,1
Coffee Shop 59,"The taste of the coffee is exactly what you pay for. I got a dollar cup of coffee but I really didn't like it. I ended up taking a couple sips & getting rid of it.  However, they do have great service, but I won't be coming back...",0
Coffee Shop 59,"I've been coming to Sorrento's for a while now, but lately I feel like I can only come if I time it just right. Whenever I try to come in the morning, theres sometimes a really long line, so my wait is longer. I am always greeted with a warm smile by the sweet morning crew, but sometimes my strict morning schedule just doesn't allow the time  for me to stop in the morning. But, when I go later in the afternoon, there's a guy there that is always outside smoking, and seems irritated when I pull up. He isn't really that friendly when taking my order and he makes me feel rushed. I usually get an iced almond milk mocha--which I know isn't the easiest drink in the world--but he just seems agitated when I tell him the details of my drink. I like coming in the afternoon though, just to avoid a line. Overall, still love my local coffee spot!",0
Coffee Shop 59,"I am from Seattle, so I was super excited to come across a drive through espresso shop. I'm used to having one on every block, so I immediately cut off eight people the second I saw it. Cheaper than Starbucks, so that's a plus. Also, I found out they serve Tully's Coffee from the PNW (my fav).... HOWEVER, I ordered a Non-fat vanilla latte, my go-to. I'm drinking it now, after just getting back to the office and could not be more disappointed. I'm 100% positive the guy gave me steamed milk. I know my Tully's, and coffee for that matter, and there is none to taste. The drink is pure white as well... I'll be going back if I ever need a drip on the go, but their specialty drinks are not going to get anymore attention from me.  AND, their cranberry muffins have nuts. Gross.",0
Coffee Shop 59,"2 check-ins I think this is where people go when the Starbucks drive-through line is too long. I've only been there once (had a kid in the car so I did drive through, which is pretty much against my religion normally). I'd have to say the iced coffee was top notch and they have breakfast tacos from Casa Chapala, which seems to have a near-monopoly on local breakfast tacos now that Elsi's is closed (they are good, I'm not complaining).  There was no wait, and the barrista was nice and fast. I'd stop again. They do have the same issue as old BC Coffee had--being on the wrong side of the road for people heading downtown. But I managed to get in and out pretty easily.  I'll try 'em again to get a better idea what's what, but so far so good. Not sure if it's a chain or just this one either.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Loved this place. Esther L found it on Yelp on our way back into the city and we shared the second-smallest iced vanilla latte. The coloring looked a little off to me and I thought it was going to be bitter but I'm happy I was wrong: a hint of vanilla and cream and strong, smooth coffee.  The lady working the little place with friendly. Not sure why it was $1 cheaper than the list price but I'm not complaining. Go here.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Gah, I love Sorrento's! Reasons:  1.) It's a drive-thru, I don't think any other local places have that going for them.  2.) Amazing customer service. I tried a new drink  this morning and the guy told me to taste it before driving off. That way, if I didn't like it he could modify it or re-make it for me. Who does that? The people here! They are so great about making sure you love what you're getting  3.) Great coffee! The plain coffee is delicious but they have all of these flavors you can try out too. Such as a toasted marshmallow latte or a buttered rum hot chocolate. Ask the barrista what he/she recommends and you'll get something fun and different for sure.  4.) Easy rewards program. I have no idea how many coffees you have to buy before you get a free one because I'm there all the dang time but you can earn free coffees. Yum!  5.) Good non-caffeinated drinks for the kiddos. They have frozen lemonades, italian sodas, smoothies and milkshakes for your kids (or yourself).  Just go and try it yourself! You'll totally love it.",1
Coffee Shop 59,I honestly want to move up North just so I can be near this place. It's near my girlfriends house and I go out of the way to go there in the morning when I stay there. Their medium ice coffee is gigantic and only $2.50 and they don't fill it up with giant ice so it's actually only two sips. It's a lot of coffee which is what I need in the morning. And it's delicious. And they have a lot of options. And it's a Drive Thru. And the girls that work there are super awesome and tolerate my dumb jokes about how tired I am. And they take your name every time you go so you can get free coffee. No punch cards that I would always forget to bring. And there's barely ever a line which is amazing but kind of scares me cause if they go out of business I will die. GO HERE ALL THE TIME. ITS THE BEST. Gigantic medium ice coffee. Deliciousville.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Best. Place. Ever!! The coffee is delicious, the staff is friendly and it's so much better than boring Starbucks coffee. Plus it's always good to support local business!!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"It goes without saying, I'm a coffee addict. I'm always searching for the maximum caffeine boost around 3pm. It just so happens we were in the area at that exact time a couple of weeks ago, and that's when we ran into this little spot. We drove up, I ordered my mocha and from the moment I took my first sip... I knew these guys knew what they were doing. It was the most absolutely perfect cup. Sweet, but not too sweet to overpower the espresso. I felt the coffee course through my veins and bring a big ol' smile to my face. Pure heavenly bliss.  I'm bummed I live south, so I cannot access this place on a daily basis. But trust me, if I did, I would be there every freaking day at 3pm for my much-needed boost.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Your 13th coffee is on the house. If you come here often, they start to remember you and what you like. They don't judge you for requesting a &@$! ton of sugar in your drink. You feel like they want to be your friend. Except for that one guy who seems chronically indifferent. This place has a warm, fuzzy spot in my heart. I choose their expensive coffee drinks over the Starbucks just one block down.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Beware of them tipping themselves.  Check your receipts.  Sigh.,0
Coffee Shop 59,"I love Sorrento's. When I moved to the Allendale area, this was the coffee shop that supplied a 4 shot Americano so I could continue my battle with unpacking.  Great coffee Pretty quick Breakfast tacos are brought in from somewhere so you can get quick food too  One negative- I tried to go there at 6:30 on a Monday morning before a work trip (after checking their hours online which say they open at 6) and they weren't open. I was sad. I love that a local place can be flexible, I just wish the hours said ""6ish"" if they will be flexible with opening. Disclaimer- usually only one person works in the morning and maybe that day there was a rare emergency, I wasn't too upset, just sad and not caffeinated until I had to stop at a Starbucks.  I will still go back just as often - just a warning if anyone else is going early in the morn!  Otherwise, this place is great. I wish that sweet, cute hut many, many customers!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Amazing coffee, great prices, a million times better than Starbucks.  Love the drive-through.",1

Coffee Shop 59,"I will not be coming back here. There was only one car in front of us and the wait was quite long. When we did reach the window it appeared that there was a girl who was being trained, which may explain the long wait. My boyfriend and I ordered two iced lattes, received our drinks, drove off, tasted our drinks, were extremely disappointed and disgusted by how awful the lattes tasted and decided to turn back around to ask for our money back. I've been to my fair share of coffee shops in Austin and this was by far the worst latte I ever tasted. Well then when my boyfriend went to the window to exchange the lackluster lattes for our money back, one of the girls candidly expressed, ""Oh, the milk is expired, maybe that's why ...""",0
Coffee Shop 59,"It's a little house.....A house in the middle of a parking lot.  What's it all about and where did it come from?  You don't go inside - it's a drive through.  Is it from Germany?  Switzerland?  Where are the yodelers?  Is it from a lumber yard?   Was it delivered via a tornado, or built from the ground up?  Needing a caffeine boost and a snack recently, I stopped by for a visit.  Sorrento's is locally owned with quick service, which is worth its weight in gold for those of us on the go. They not only have coffee, but they serve breakfast tacos and goodies from Russell's bakery. Their lattes are delicious. And if that's not enough, they're nice too.  It is a nice respite from ""been there, done that on every street corner"" down the street.",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Just found out this place is under new ownership and the new guys are just as nice and friendly as the former owners.  I'm sorry I never posted here before, since their coffee is great (so much better than Starbucks' burned java) and, as a local owner, they need our business.  It's hard to compete against the big boxes.  This place is just as good as my downtown fave, the Bike Caffe in the plaza at 9th and Congress in front of the big office building.  Oh, and they also have good breakfast tacos, although I don't usually get those.  I like their iced coffee and pastries (used to be from Russel's, guess they still are).  They also have milk shakes, which I had once - wonderful!  But I go for the coffee.  As a lazy American, it's nice not to have to leave your car!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Listed in The Bestest! Can't pass this little place up when I'm on Anderson lane. The draw is too great and the place is so convenient. They've managed to hold on for a few years now, even with ""Stir-Buck$"" right across the street.  The coffee drinks are all high quality, but to confess, I'm a major fan of their daily drip grind. I know...boring review, but we're talking coffee, K?...It's what I go for every time I'm there. So if the drip is good, you know the rest is pretty tasty :-)  Staff are always nice and I'm greeted with a smile every time I go.  You don't find that attitude very often on Anderson Lane and parts north, now do ya?  Wish they had more stores here in ATX, but here's hoping they never become synonymous with the McDonald's of Coffee!  It's all about the Roasted Bean Juice....LOL!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"Love this place!  A) It's NOT Starbucks.B) It's fast. C) They are super friendly and their reward program doesn't require any work D) they have BIG water bottles, and E) Really good coffee!  They are my new favorite morning spot.",1
Coffee Shop 59,5 check-ins When i want coffee.....i always go to Sorrento's,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Those sad, lonely days when we are out of coffee are not so sad anymore. I take a quick detour through the neighborhood to an honest-to-god independently owned coffee house that saves my butt.  Sometimes the drip isn't as strong as I would like, but I learned that I can ask for the ""bold drip"" and get french roast or something similar. They add however many sweetners and a touch of creamer that I like and I'm on my way, usually in less than 5 minutes, waiting time and all. Don't forget to give them your name and they'll track how many coffees you have, after 10 coffees, you get one free!",1
Coffee Shop 59,"This is a damn fine cup of coffee for a reasonable price. After spontaneously deciding I needed to give myself some nice, warm delicious caffeine juice, I pulled up to the little drive-thru house.  The set-up is pretty straightforward. Pull up to the window, select your drink, pay your cash, leave a tip in the tip jar, drive away and get to drinking.  I ordered a Grande Latte, with little sugar. I'm not huge on sweet coffees, but I feel the sugar can round out some of the flavor at times. The latte was great, I was surprised how big the cup was for $2.65 (the girl said it was happy hour at 1pm?). I'd say on regular hours, you'd probably be paying the same, if not a tiny bit less, than you would at starbucks, but for 2.65? Hellz yeah.  Really enjoyed the coffee, if you like Starbucks style lattes, you'll like this place. If you want a more...European/Italian style coffee, go to a sit down place like San Francisco Bakery across the street.",1
Coffee Shop 59,Awesome drip. You don't do your own sugar and cream but they somehow manage to do it just right. No inside seating. Outdoor seating available.  Drive through or walk up window.  $1.74 to fill up my Starbucks 16oz  cup. Freebirds vibe...piercings etc.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"Their cappuccinos and lattes are very good, much better than Sbux across the street, and the employees are extremely friendly, which I really like. I also like the walk-up/drive-thru combo. Plus it's a locally owned business, so I like giving them my money.  (And they're bold and brassy, as shown by using Disney's trademarked font for their prices sign, despite a Disney studio being right across the street.)",1
Coffee Shop 59,Got a tall cappuccino with an extra espresso shot.. even with an extra shot I couldn't taste the coffee much. It definitely lacked the strength and flavor. I am not being picky and looking for a very good taste/strength but I would expect a descent flavor atleast like a Starbucks (not the best..but atleast acceptable).  I do not see any price advantage either for a small shack ...$3.40 for a capuccino with extra shot..same as what I would pay elsewhere.  I haven't tried regular coffee or other items here so can't comment on those..,0
Coffee Shop 59,The service was great. Really nice dude. Simple. Good coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 59,"2 check-ins I've driven past Sorrentos hundreds if not thousands of times over the years.  Although I am not a fan of Starbucks, when in need of coffee in the area I generally go there.  One morning on my way to work Starbucks had an entirely too long line so I decided to give Sorrentos a shot.  For a very short line the wait was long.  It should not take 10 minutes to make two people coffee.  The coffee itself was mediocre at best.  It tasted burned and like it had been sitting for quite a while.  Several weeks later I decided to give them another shot, maybe I had just come on a bad morning?  I guess I will never know as when I pulled in to line there were three cars ahead of me, ten minutes later and one car had been served.  I'm sorry but that it is about ten times as long as it should take.  I would love to be able to give them my business as opposed to the mega corporation across the street but they just don't deserve it.",0

Coffee Shop 59,"Listed in COFFEE... Best caramel macchiato I've had, no doubt.    This cute little drive/walk up was being operated by a very friendly lady that made our coffee, made some chit chat, and cashed us out.  Yes, there is a little bit of a wait because of one or two people in the hut doing all the work, but the wait was definitely worth it.  If you have a Keurig machine at home, I don't recommend you go here and order regular coffee, unless you like Tully's blend and just want someone else to make it for you.  There's nothing wrong with Tully's, but we have a Keurig at home so we wouldn't pay someone else to make a cup we can make for ourselves (also we'd probably have a Green Mountain blend instead).  But, the other drinks are very delish.  We imagined this place being started by an entrepreneur with dreams of owning/running a standing coffee house (instead of a hut) one day.  Hope that's true, but even if it's not, we support this little coffee hut with the surprisingly good coffee.  We can't wait to go up north again for a cuppa from this place.",1

First off, this place kicks Starbucks' A, S, S. I work in the area and I have to say, their coffee is so much more satisfying in taste. (Trust me. I'm a hardcore coffee drinker. My caffeinated hands are literally sh..sh..shaking when I'm typing this.) Plus, they don't do that little half cup full of foam trick to your latte like some shady big franchise does (*cough).  The wait is never long and the staff is always friendly. Gotta love their happy hour too! WHAT? You heard it right!  I mean, does Starbucks remember your name and what your usual drink is?

And i was pleasantly surprised when the barista asked me if i had a frequent buyer card (what?! Yes please!), She put my name into the computer and handed me a silvery credit-ish looking card that will give me my 11th cup 'o joe for FREE.

Coffee Shop 59,"Sorrento's Rocks! Just an awesome locally owned and operated business.  The service is Stellar! The drinks rock (especially the Green Tea & Chai). They have breakfast tacos that go fast for a reason. Every order is served with a side of smile at no extra charge. All in all, a highly recommended stop. I can't even remember if I showered or what I had for breakfast some mornings, but somehow, they remember what I like. So tip your baristas for that reason alone especially given the amount of traffic that rolls through.  They also offer a member card that grants you a free drink for every nine purchased. So stop by, say hello and treat yourself to something far and above the place that shall not be named across the street.

Since they close at 1pm on Sunday I couldn't get back to talk to them in person before they closed, so I wrote them but they haven't responded.

But I had a really negative experience with the barista here, which contradicts what most everyone else seems to experience.  Maybe the woman working Elixir that morning was really hangry or something--I don' t know--but in the few minutes of interaction, there was an unremitting stream of rude coming out of that food truck window, the peak of which would have to be the ""c'mon out with it"" hand gesture she made (the one where you rotate your wrist, hand, and outstretched fingers in small circles) when I apparently did not make my order quickly enough.  To be clear, I had not been standing there for more than a few seconds of decision-making.  And there was no one else in line behind me.  Any coffeeshop/barista can have a bad day, I suppose, but with the wealth of delicious coffee in a one mile radius, it is really shooting yourself in the foot to be so remarkably hostile to a customer.",0

Coffee Shop 18,I don't like to give poor reviews... But... The coffee was not great for a place that only sells beverages. Plenty of awesome coffee shops in the area that we'll choose over this one. Thunderbird and Cherrywood are on point.,0
Coffee Shop 18,They are super friendly and made me a great iced chai tea latte. I didn't have to wait forever either. What's not to like?,1
Coffee Shop 18,31 check-ins Consistently good and affordable. I got their travel mug and now my mochas are only $2,1
Coffee Shop 18,"2 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost, Austin Food Carts One thing I love about these coffee trailers is the great personality of the folks working them. The worker (and I presume owner) was so friendly. I appreciated the genuine conversation, and I think I was energized by my interaction with him alone!  Another bonus with Elixer is that the entire menu already includes tax. The prices are very, very reasonable in light of that. I opted for a drip coffee - nice and strong. Flavor wise, nothing stuck out, but I'd love to try the other drinks. They get their beans from Fara Coffee, a local roaster with beans originating from Nicaragua.  In addition, there's lenty of seating for you to enjoy your drink, and Elixer provides an easy option for caffeine as you wait for your order from the other trucks: FOtT, Bud's, etc.  Overall, Elixer offers strong drinks with fantastic service. Whether you're stopping by before work or searching for a mid-day pick-me-up, add Elixer on your list for East Austin caffeine stops.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"A cute little coffee truck conveniently located at Mueller lake park. There are a few different few trucks at this park, but definitely check out Elixer.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"I don't like writing negative reviews but my experience sat with me all day and I felt like I should say something. I was really excited to try some coffee from this cute little truck, but now it's no longer such a cute little truck... I had one of the worst interactions I've encountered living here in Austin, it took me by such surprise. I looked at all these reviews saying how nice the baristas here are, well not this one. The women that took my order was straight up rude from the very beginning. When I asked a question she snapped at me like I should have known that they were out of something on their menu. Then when I was trying to pay, she was annoyed with how I was paying & told me so, and I think that was the 3rd time I apologized by then (because clearly I was ruining her day and doing everything wrong trying to order a coffee). I felt completely harassed in less than a 1-2 min time span. When I thought maybe she just hated me for some reason, my fiancé ordered and he misheard her grumbles so she then yelled at him ""what do you want?!"" Yeah, not just me. And the coffee? It was okay...but definitely not worth it when you have to deal with the extremely rude barista. Not going to be back, there's PLENTY other really great coffee places in town with baristas that are actually friendly, it's really unfortunate.",0
Coffee Shop 18,"I love this place. Everyone who works here is friendly, both to me and to my kids, and they take pride in their product. My little girl (age 4) enquired about chocolate milk, and boy did the barrista deliver! She said it was the best chocolate milk she's ever had! My americano is always smooth and just right. I love their location, too. Close to our house and easy parking. There are places to sit if you would like to hang out, and there are toys for the kids to keep them occupied. Miss G gives 2 thumbs up for Elixir's excellent chocolate milk. I prefer the Americano, myself.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"4 check-ins And the Academy Award for friendliest barista in Austin goes to.. Adam at Elixer Coffee. [applause - clapclapclap] Elixer Coffee gets it right. They get everything right. On top of hiring an exceptional barista, they also serve up phenomenal locally-roasted coffee.  What I like about Elixer (in no particular order): 1. Their coffee. Elixer serves up Austin's own Fara Coffee. And it's delicious! 2. Adam. Adam is hands down the friendliest, most genuine barista in town. Maybe it's his Midwestern/Wisconsin charm. I'm not sure what it is, but it works perfectly with Austin. 3. Coolest food truck. Ever. Where can I get me one of these?! 4. Affordable. Nothing on the menu is over $3.50. Tax is always included. Love, love, love this! It makes things so easy!  Favorite drinks: + Iced coffee. Typically slow-brewed for over 24-hours. Served as-is, or with a little agave syrup and cream. MMmmmmm.. + Iced hazelnut/vanilla latte. + Americano. For when I want something slightly more potent than drip coffee, which is also good here btw!  Tips: + Elixer is located in the Mueller Trailer Park off of Airport, east of I-35. + If you bring your own coffee mug, you can get a $2 refill of any drink! (Note: This only applies to refills.)",1
Coffee Shop 18,"Listed in Coffee, the drug of choice Exceptional coffee, great service, perfect hours! There is nothing I like better than trundling up to the counter on those cold cloudy days when I've run out of beans at home.  Other than a simply great location, this coffee is caf-FINE! Dark, rich and strong, I actually needed a tiny bit of cream to bite this one. The barrista seemed genuinely happy to serve me and chat while he put together my order, and I got to watch the pink sunrise over the park. Other bonuses include reasonable prices and tax included in the menu. ($2 for a simple cup of drip coffee.)",1
Coffee Shop 18,First to Review Listed in It's a 4 or 5 star Trailer food! Elixer Coffee is one of the most original and awesome ideas in the ever growing trailer park food stand places! Roscoe is the name of the 1952 Studebaker truck that is fully outfitted in the bed to serve numerous types of organic espresso drinks and teas.  I decided on the cold brewed iced coffee with organic whole milk and it was just about perfect - I prefer my brew stronger but that could have been my fault for adding too much milk. When asked how it was I mentioned that and Keturah (the proprietor) offered to add more Coffee which made it much better. The other creamer options are organic half and half and nonfat milk. My only suggestion would be invest in Stevia or at least Splenda instead of Sweet N Low for people who can not take sugar.  Bonus points for offering my dogs a bowl of water!!!  They are currently located in the new Trailer Park at 801 Barton Springs Rd just East of Lamar. dog friendly cold brewed iced coffee See all photos from Tara M. for Elixer Coffee,1
Coffee Shop 18,"I had a quad espresso and my boo had a latte. Friendly, knowledgable staff. No wait at all. Best coffee I've had since I was in France. I've been trying to find a place worth visiting. I'll be back! Ps. Their drip coffee looked absolutely phenomenal.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"I really like this place. I usually drive past it on the way to work and have always wanted to stop. Well today was that day!  From the highway it looks like a cute little truck with a neon coffee sign. When i pulled up to the food trailers, there was a line in front of the coffee truck. The first thing i noticed was how nice the guy was that was serving coffee. He was really having fun and I don't know about you, but i really appreciate someone that is nice and courteous. The next thing i noticed was the excellent prices! I felt like they were competitively priced. I really liked his espresso machine. It had cool handles where he would push it down and then push it up to extract the shot. He said it was a 20 year old machine and the pistons gave him ultimate control over the shot. Nice touch!  The coffee was excellent. I ordered a Spiced Brown Sugar Latte. The drink was smooth and creamy. It wasn't bitter at all and not too sweet. It was exactly want I wanted it to be and more.  A nice final touch was the fact that they have a 512 Rewards punch card. Rather than wasting paper and space in your wallet on a business card with holes stamped/punched it in, they opted for a mobile app. It's an application that, when installed, the user can scan a QR code and add a ""virtual"" punch to their card.  All and all, I will defiantly be going back to this business and would highly recommend for anyone else to as well.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"Coffee... trailer... definitely Austin. These coffee trailers are going haywire in Austin, and nothing is stopping them! This one is tucked back into the new Mueller trailer park off of Airport. I pulled in one morning, and I loved the trendy looking buzz set up right in the back of a ""watermelon"" truck.  The offerings are straightforward--with tax included being a major plus. My cup of joe was going to be the Starter Fuel: pour over with a shot of espresso. It was rich, dark, and potent--certainly able to perk me up, as I am not a caffeine junkie. At $3 flat, it will certainly fit a buzzed up individual's budget.  The guy out front on the nippy morning provided some great service, and that made my black all the better.  Good set-up, good location, and awesome product and service. What more do you want out of a go-to coffee joint? Oh, and the trailer aspect fits right into Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"I can recommend both the lattes and the cold brew coffee at Elixer, the cold brew packs a serious caffeine punch. They also serve scones etc. from local bakeries.  What makes the place really stand out is the atmosphere. Service is exceptionally friendly, and espresso drinks are only $2 if you bring your own cup.  If you're driving up Airport Blvd as part of your commute, the location at the old Mueller hangar makes them very convenient for a quick caffeine fix in the morning.",1
Coffee Shop 18,Great coffee and great conversation with the owner.  You have to hunt for the place but the rewards are worth it.,1
Coffee Shop 18,"Great coffee. Great company.  I worked with Keturah for a SXSW event for a client and she was great! Not only was she super flexible about what we wanted to do - she helped us find a place to host the truck and let us give out our own coffee mugs - she was also just a pleasure to work with every day.  Most important - the coffee was delish! Definitely recommended if you're in Austin... and if you ever find yourself needing to caffeinate a crowd, you should call!",1
Coffee Shop 18,"There's a movie review protocol I've heard that says a great movie is 3 great scenes and no bad scenes.  That's a good way to describe this place: I've had 3 cups of great, inexpensive coffee from a friendly dude who works there, and I'm very pleased.  Does not accept credit cards, but that's actually how they keep the prices down.  If I lived nearby I'd be here daily.",1
Coffee Shop 18,Keturah brought a truck to the Cherrywood Plant & Book Swap. It was a BIG hit having Elixer Coffee on hand. Several people mentioned how great it was to having their excellent coffee in close proximity to the neighborhood event.  Thanks Keturah and I hope you will be back for the Swap in March 2011!,1
Coffee Shop 18,"Listed in Treats from Mobile Eats, The '23 I loooooove this little coffee truck. Keturah, the owner, is selling really good coffee out of the cutest little Studebaker. Everyone who works there is super friendly, and the coffee is STRONG. I usually get iced and it is perfection (and this is coming from a major coffee snob). It's also very reasonably priced ($2.50 for iced). This has become my go-to coffee spot when I run out at home and want my coffee to go. Love, love, love.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"Cool little spot but the cappuccino is just not good.  Beans taste over roasted and the milk was steamed nothing like it should be (""barista"" needs some training on microfoam).  Not sure how the sugar-laden drinks compare to a Starbucks but with all the other great espresso shops in town this one is a huge miss.  Two stars for the nice people working there.",0
Coffee Shop 18,I love when someone is more passionate than me on any subject. The guy running this coffee truck is just that. Iced coffee sweetened with Agave.. I would have given them the 5th star but the 2 times I have been here the Pastry's and Bagels are sold out...,1
Coffee Shop 18,"I'm a regular here.  Great espresso drinks made to order, and a friendly staff...what's not to like?  Avoid corporate coffee chain stores and go to Elixir Coffee.   Now, if they'll just let me take the Studebaker truck for a spin...",1
Coffee Shop 18,"Elixer is fantastic!  The owners are genuinely nice people and I have never had a bad experience.  Their coffee and espresso drinks are spot on and reasonably priced.  In addition to their drinks, they work with Quack's bakery to offer an assortment of baked goods (try the pumpkin bread or the pull apart muffin - no clue what it's called but it's pretty tasty!).",1
Coffee Shop 18,Excellent coffee (and I am picky about my coffee). Excellent service from intelligent people. Eco-friendly and reasonably priced. I enjoyed my experience at Elixer and will definitely return!,1

Coffee Shop 18,"I love this place!  The coffee is great, but the chai is my favorite.  The staff is always friendly.  It's a nice place to hang out or meet friends before heading for a walk around Mueller park with the dogs.  I love the Tin Bean, Elixer's other coffee truck, too and see it around town occasionally for events.  Same delicious drinks.  Glad to hear they are opening a new permanent location at Big Red Sun on Cesar Chavez.",1
Coffee Shop 18,"The lattes are amaaaazing.  The service --impecable. Complete with dog treats. When I'm on the go, this is my morning ritual.  And they have $2 drinks when you bring your own mug--need I say more??!! I heart Elixer.",1

Coffee Shop 18,"I love this place! I walk my dog here in the mornings. When we get there he gets a treat and I get my coffee. Coffee is brewed at optimal temperatures, taste wonderful, and there are a lot of options hidden in that little truck.

Coffee Shop 7,4 check-ins I've been in California a year and have yet to come across a coffee with Almond Milk available with the milk & sugars by the caps and such. I had to come here twice in one day for cold brews (no ice). Delicious.  The service was really pleasant both times with two different barisatas.,1
Coffee Shop 7,Summary- Great Latte's  Popped in on the way out of downtown for two latte's to go- they were excellent. Just all around great and could stand up against any other very good to great Latte I have ever had except maybe one or two in Seattle that are forever stuck in my head.,1
Coffee Shop 7,I went here for a Sunday Tea service.  The staff was amazing and they all seemed to want to be there. The large variety of teas was excellent as was the expertly decorated finger foods. I didn't know I liked cucumber sandwiches until I tried them here. Now I want more! The Petite Fours were extremely moist and tasty. Scones with a variety if spreads made me happy.  Hope to do this again sometime. See all photos from Lauren F. for Cafe Ruckus,1
Coffee Shop 7,"The store is comfy and cozy, a great place to spend your Saturday afternoon. I had Mexican mocha, lovely. One suggestion would be having a wider variety of pastries :) Inside",1
Coffee Shop 7,One word - AMAZING. Favorite coffee shop in Austin. Have to love a place that has delicious almond milk free at the milk stations and wonderful staff who always make you feel so welcome. Big plus is the cute puppies that patrons always bring with them outside since they have a super convenient order window outside- puppy approved!,1
Coffee Shop 7,"Great location, small space. Board games available. My marble mocha was good--had a rich, smooth taste.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Was here for the YEE.. Check out the reviews on the event page..!!!  Definitely coming back for coffee & shortbread cookies..!!!  Pasting the review from YEE: ================================ Oh how magical it was to join this wonderful High tea on a beautiful Sunday morning with fellow YEs and the new CM.  I am not a Tea person, but that may change if the tea was this good & the sandwiches & cookies were .. Umm.. Perfection.. How gently sweet as they complement the different flavored teas..  The bite sized sandwiches are made to perfection.. The cucumber cream cheese sandwich was to die for.. I mean c'mmon, so simple but so yummy..!!  The wait staff ever so attentive & considerate to every need.. More importantly anticipating the pace of the event and keeping the drinks filled & the service going without ever interrupting ..!! That's professional.. You can tell..  I will stop by for coffee & sandwiches as well to try more things.. Did anyone notice the number of board games available at the store..?? That right there calls for a perfect relaxing setting for a beverage of choice & nice conversation..!!  Please visit & support.. This place is not just a tea/coffee stopover.. But a great overall experience..!! =================================",1
Coffee Shop 7,"High tea?  Otherwise known as how to stuff your face with more scones, pastries and finger sandwiches than any adult should eat in their lifetime, washed down with vast amounts of tea.  What's not to like?  The high tea served at Cafe Ruckus is a fine exemplar of this Fellini's Satyricon for Anglophiles.  Great tea. (I particularly endorse their mixed berry tea which is one of the best herbal teas I have had anywhere.)  Definitely tasty little finger sandwiches. Cucumber sandwiches are a must for the genre and their cucumber sandwich is pretty good.  This allows you to pretend you are being delicate before pulling out the heavy guns and going whole hog on the scones.  The scones themselves are first rate.  I offer a particular shout out for the chocolate scones that have chocolate chunks the size of the Houses of Parliament.  They offer lemon curd, raspberry jam and clotted cream to go with the scones - and those are nice on the currant scones.  They are pure overload on the chocolate scones -  which in this case means, go ahead and slather the jam the curd and the clotted cream right in there!  And naturally after all that jam, and chocolate and lemon curd, you still have to have dessert right????  The petit fours are first rate ...  but the secret star of the show dessert is a thin frosted chocolate mint cookie they slide in next to the petit fours.  You think this is going to be just a modest filler - but it is a completely delightful mint cookie.  And yes, there is still room for delight even after cramming down all the other stuff.  To be sure, you may come into Cafe Ruckus looking like Virginia Woolf, and leave looking like Winston Churchill.  But high tea is all about personal growth.  You have erudite conversation to expand your mind.  You eat a trolley full of pastries to expand the rest of you.  God Save the Queen!",1
Coffee Shop 7,Strong cortado. Good cappuccino. Board games available to play. Cozy but comfortable location on 2nd St. Not too loud during a Saturday afternoon visit. Friendly service. Recommended.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"The staff was extremely friendly, they have some yummy looking fresh baked goods and any coffee shop that also sells beer and wine is a great spot in my book. I was glad to see they offered almond milk both behind the counter and by the creamers to add to your drink. My one note, I didn't totally love my latte... tasted a bit burnt but it might have just been me. I will absolutely try this place again!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"yeah.  I love stopping by here while walking the dog in the morning. Not nearly enough places have a window for you to order outside, plus they have a water bowl for our 4-legged friends! I like a good, strong latte which they do well but what sets Cafe Ruckus apart is how friendly the staff is. Constantly friendly and always smiling, every time! I wish they had a little more variety to the breakfast tacos offered though, the mashed potatoes in 2 of them are just... weird. I didn't even finish them. A basic bacon, egg, cheese taco would be great.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Parking is a pain around this area but the coffee is delicious here. It was worth my paid garage parking! Cheap and delicious. Awesome recommendation on the milky coffee. (Forgot the name, sorry. But it was very good!) Very friendly staff!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"2 check-ins First off, Ruckus is one of my new fav coffee spots! If it wasn't a 20+min drive from my house this place would be my caffeine equivalent of Cheers!  Secondly, the owner Keith (who is so nice!) and his amazing baristas just make you feel instantly at home!  And let's not forget about the coffee! B'Omg! The espresso was beyond phenomenal, the Mexican Mocha=life changing, and the ""After Dark"" (NOT a decaf) was absolutely fantastic w/the perfect balance of flavor and smoothness!  Oh...and the pastries! Chocolate Croissant? Get in my mouth! Blueberry muffin as big as a baby's head? Get. In. My. Mouth. 'Nuff said!  And finally, the highlight...latté art by the Latté Artist, himself, Andrew! Kid has mad milk foam skillZ yo!  Also, talking with Mr. Ruckus himself for a bit, you can really tell his love and passion for this place and his coffee! And when love is the main ingredient, it will always taste better!  Can't wait to come back and get my caffeine fix! In-house Latte Art by Andy The menu! Delicious pastries! See all photos from Leila R. for Cafe Ruckus",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Whoa!  The sarsaparilla tea was the best steep in town. It has the aroma and earthiness of tea with the sweet finish of root beer.  The food is surprisingly filling for just finger foods and I'm a pretty big eater. We had the Brie and turkey which was carefully hand crafted and trimmed like the other sandwiches appeared. You can really taste the quality of ingredients because the sandwich themselves are very simple yet tasty.  The scones are the best in town in comparison to places like the steeping room or other brunch places because they are not only better consistency but also almost twice the size!  Scones are a must with the clotted cream spread. I recommend the chocolate chip scone.  Finally dessert is very innovative and well presented. Cake pops are so last year with their little cake cube bites. You don't feel guilty eating like 3 because they are only a few bites each. Lastly the atmosphere and staff is incredible as you are treated like royalty in their small party events. This is the perfect places for a quick breakfast/brunch bite, tea, or a party event as they have a assortment of board games. High tea Sunday!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"If it wasn't for the wonderful quotes on the outside sign, you might not know that this cafe was located here. Okay, the big old RUCKUS sign does help a little.  The cafe has strong and deep, rich coffee. I had an ice latte and a salted carmel milkshake. The milkshake is not for the faint of heart. Unbeknown to me, it was filling and rich enough to be my lunch ... wow, how great is that! (It is best to finish the latte first, give yourself a little time, and then move onto the milkshake.)  We, also, purchased some of the Ruckus Roast beans and will try that out tomorrow and provide an update later.  There are sandwiches there, but they are made off site and then brought  in. They do have Saint Arnold Root Beer. See all photos from Van T. for Cafe Ruckus",1
Coffee Shop 7,"This is one of my regular places to grab coffee. It's not a fancy third-wave operation, but it's not Dunkin Donuts, either. The line has never been too long, the staff is always super friendly, and they have punch cards so you get a free beverage for every five drinks that you buy. And they are a few blocks away from work so I intend to keep coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Great tea selection.    Excellent  quality.  SUPER friendly staff. Definitely will come back. The seating is limited and the space is small, but still a great place to hang out.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"The staff is so warm here!! And they have PhDs in drinks:  the array of delicious choices on the menu is amazing. A quieter choice than some others nearby, really a friendly and welcoming oasis for a fine little repast.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Cute little cafe with red decor. With I took pictures....  Great service. Cashiers/baristas were friendly and helpful in making decisions. Affogato with vanilla ice cream: it was pricey but still good! Chai Tea Latte: I think if I were to go again, this would be what I would get. Perfect blend of chai and latte!  Quiet little cafe with wifi and tables big enough to study!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"5 check-ins Still great, even after the Yelp event I attended here recently.  I loved this place so much I was excited to head back with some girl friends during a day downtown.  It's small, but so full of character.  I love the community events they hold here, game nights, music nights, and even afternoon tea parties (pre-registration required).  Mr. Ruckus was playing barista the afternoon I came and I had the delicious Mexican Mocha.  We reviewed the great diverse collection of board games and selected a 1960's classic girly ""pick your date"" type game.  We had a blast just hanging out sipping our coffee's and playing the game.  It was great to see others coming in doing the same us.  At one time there were 3 groups of us playing games.  I think one couple even brought in their board game.  This place is all around awesome, clean, friendly service, amazing coffee, and all natural St. Arnold's root beer on draft!  If you have your furry friend with, no worries order at the outside pick up window, and sit down at one of tables on the sidewalk.  I just wish they had some gluten free pastries in the mix.  The coffee roasted here is a special blend mixed up by Keith Ruckus.  He partnered with Texas Coffee Roasters and added his special ingredients to come up with the Ruckus roast.  Looking forward to more amazing memories to be made at Cafe Ruckus.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"2 check-ins I love a good Ruckus Buzz!  My most recent was visit to Ruckus was on HAAM Benefit Day.  I had been up since 5:30am, running all over our beautiful city.  By noon I was dragging and was at City Hall.  That's when I remembered 1. I was walking distance to Ruckus and 2. Ruckus was donating 5% of their profits to HAAM that day...WINNER! WINNER!  Thank you Ruckus for giving me the energy I need to get through the day AND be so awesome and giving back to the music community.  My favorite thing to do in Austin on a Saturday is to hit the Farmers Market and have coffee at Cafe Ruckus.  This is hands down the best coffee in town!  The have the nicest baristas in town, including the owner Keith who is a sweetheart!  Everything I have had here is amazing.  I especially love the Mexican Mocha...you MUST try! Grabbing coffee and supporting musicians on HAAM Benefit Day!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"3 check-ins To quote the movie Dumb and Dumber (said with British accent):  ""I like it.  I like it a lot"".    Cafe Ruckus is pretty cool.  This is largely in part because the owner Keith Ruckus is pretty cool.  Keith is part of the Alamo Drafthouse Action Pack family.  Don't be surprised to find him working the counter.  He's really nice and down to earth.    Their coffee is from Texas Coffee Traders.  My original idea was to get coffee, or maybe a chai since I heard the chai is good.  But upon investigation of their menu I discovered that Keith's sister has put together a super-fantastic tea menu (Rori's Tea Room) with tea leaves she has selected from all over the world and it. is. Delightful.  The tea comes in a small pot with a strainer, and you can get full tea service if you want.  I had Candy Apple White and thought it was really great.  I found myself craving it days later.  I have a feeling return visits for me are going to include lots of tea.  Other features:  root beer on tap and glass bottles of Topo Chico and Mexican Coke.  You can have them make you a float since they have ice cream.  They also have pastries from Quack's bakery.    The seating inside is limited but somehow is still roomy.  There are plenty of outlet strips.  They have a window facing 2nd street that you can order from and a small table for outdoor seating.  Parking is a bitch in this part of downtown.  However the really great indie/art house Violet Crown Cinema is upstairs across the street and they validate up to 4 hours of parking in the AMLI parking garage if you buy a movie ticket.  You should come have a coffee or tea after a movie.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Excellent hot chocolate!  Ok, so we actually stopped in here after dinner b/c I realized I had to pee.  I ordered a hot chocolate and got a croissant so that I could use the bathroom.  I believe the owner was at the bar.  He was really nice. The hot chocolate, Amazing!  It tasted like Mexican hot chocolate - with cinnamon and vanilla.  Very yummy.  Best part, the prices were normal.  It was less than $5 for the nice little snack.  I shall definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 7,sometimes i wish i went to school in Austin just for their cafes. This is a great study spot. The barista was very welcoming and sweet! He had some great recommendations when i gave him a preference to what i was craving and i ended up enjoying it! I ordered an iced mexican mocha.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"Their iced coffee is no ordinary iced coffee. It is cold brew and if you haven't had cold brew coffee, you're in for a treat. Cafe Ruckus' cold brew is the best damn coffee I've ever had. Seriously. This coffee is no joke.  I would drive across town to get this coffee. As the barista told me while I was there, ""it's legit"" and that boy ain't lyin'.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"This place is great because there's finally a coffee shop in the abandoned old coffee shop place and even though there's coffee shops all over downtown, this area needed one. Not to mention it's just downstairs from work. The vibe is a hodgepodge of existing decor and some of the owners personal flair as well.  Their americano was hot, nutty but it left an aftertaste that I couldn't get rid of for a while. I dunno. Besides that, the prices are reasonable and they have pasties and Mexican coke for those looking for something else than coffee. They also have a loose leaf variety. It seems a little pricey but hey, what can you do. Good selection though. I hope this place lasts. Good, friendly people and that people look passed the new Starbucks going up down the corner and support the locals.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Listed in The Yelp 100 Challenge 2014 Come here for the coffee, but also come here for Keith Ruckus, because he's a slam poet, a comic book contributer, and God knows how many other things.  He makes a damn good chai latte.",1
Coffee Shop 7,I wish I could write a wonderful review like so many others have. Unfortunately they closed at least ten minutes before 10 PM. The time it says they close here on yelp. Extremely disappointed.,0
Coffee Shop 7,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  Friendly coffee shop. I purchased a 20-ounce iced soy mocha from Cafe Ruckus. Best of all it was bittersweet--my favorite. It was nice and strong with a bold coffee flavor. One of the best iced coffee drinks I've had in Austin. It looks like they offer late hours on the weekends, too.  They offer free WIFI, but there was not a lot of outlets for laptops.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Great shop! I consider myself a coffee connoisseur and this place was pretty good! They have several flavor shots to choose from, my favorite being lavender! I got a hot latte and the espresso was great not bitter and the crema was smooth and thick! My little had the Mexican mocha, and I would definitely recommend it! It wasn't the best coffee I've ever had, but definitely no disappointment.",1
Coffee Shop 7,Amazing little coffee shop. I walked past and decided to get a little afternoon pick me up. The coffee was amazing. It didn't taste artificial. I loved it.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"I love that they have this coffee shop at this location. Its next to the lake and after a walk (or before) its nice to come here and unwind.. Not only is the location amazing, the coffee is really good. The decor is really great.. Theres outdoor seating.. Theres wifi.. great place to have coffee and get some work done..",1
Coffee Shop 7,Great coffee spot nestled on W 2nd downtown.  Quaint.  Good quality coffee and an array of goodies to choose from.,1
Coffee Shop 7,Really love this place. Super friendly staff and yummy coffee. My favorite spot to chill before an ACL taping at the Moody Theater or catching a movie at Violet Crown.  For you coffee connoisseurs Cafe Ruckus has a custom La Marzocco that they grind out some of the finest beans available in the land.  Family friendly game night happens every Monday night but an assortment of board games are always available to play for free. Plenty of sidewalk tables and chairs to enjoy an iced coffee in the gorgeous downtown Austin 2nd Street District.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"One of the best espresso macchiatos I've had since moving to Texas from the PNW. The owner, Keith Ruckus, really knows what good coffee is and he takes pride in his work. Laid back atmosphere is gljust right on a rainy Sunday afternoon.",1
Coffee Shop 7,Updated review Came here for a little pick me up before a movie at the violet crown! I got the mexican spice hot chocolate and it was delicious!!,1
Coffee Shop 7,Nice quick spot for coffee. Friendly staff.  Small area with a decent lounge area. Nestled in a not-so-busy area of 2nd street. And prices are relatively fair. Give it a try and see for yourself.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"Best High Tea in Austin.   I took my mother to high tea for Mother's Day at Café Ruckus. The petit fours, scones and finger sandwiches were delicious and more than we could consume in one sitting. Yay for leftovers! We sampled more than one tea, and the choices were numerous and delightful. Rory (co-owner with her brother)  served us with attentiveness and warmth.  Ruckus is the best.",1
Coffee Shop 7,Visiting for a second time. Such a cute and small coffee shop. Love the lavender but always stick with vanilla. Staff is super friendly. Yay for ruckus!!!,1
Coffee Shop 7,"Drop dark roast was very weak - no brightness, no fruitiness, no floral, just flat. I am not saying that it was old beans, but seemed to be fresh brew. But like coffee that was ground a while back. The cortado had no espresso taste, very similar to when it is not pulled correctly. Even before we tasted the coffee and espresso we knew we were in trouble because of the lack of coffee smell. The ambience is ok. A little too polished inside. I am not getting all the great reviews here, but many do not mention the coffee.",0
Coffee Shop 7,"I work just around the corner and so I go to this place VERY often. I'm a fan.  Service is chill, friendly, timely. The drip coffee is great - medium or a dark roast. Since they usually only set out half and half, I ask for almond milk and they are happy to oblige.  The only espresso drink I've had here is an iced almond latte and it was like dessert in a cup - so creamy and delicious. It was amazing.  I really want to try their pastries. They have breakfast tacos in the morning, usually from The Vegan Nom I think.  Cool neighborhood joint.",1
Coffee Shop 7,Love this place for casual work environment. Staff is friendly. Place is clean. You gotta ask for the key to the toilet which keeps the place cleaner than most.  Coffee is top quality. I've had many of the baked goods. All terrific.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"10 check-ins Cafe Ruckus is the place to go! I had a chai tea latte here and it was amazing! I usually frequent Starbucks and I love their chai tea lattes, but really- this was so much better. They also sell a variety of pastries and they have saint Arnold root beer from a tap! Yum! Another great thing about this cafe is that they have games! The staff are also super friendly and you feel right at home. This is a great place to go chill and get some coffee alone or with friends- go check it out!",1
Coffee Shop 7,This is a cheery little spot with good coffee and good pastries.  The people who work there are happy and helpful.  It's a good respite from the normal Second Street District pretentious hoo-ha.,1
Coffee Shop 7,Awesome place in the heart of downtown. Good for evening coffees and teas. They have wide varieties of both and morning breakfast tacos. Good place for a coffee and some board games. Mexican Mocha & hazelnut mocchiato..,1
Coffee Shop 7,"40 check-ins First to Review I swung by here on it's grand opening day and tried some of their affogato and a latte. Delish! Everyone was chipper and smiling behind the counter, the owner was there again shaking hands and schmoozing, and the crowd was lovely. Tasteful decorations, comfortable color scheme, and plenty of light; it's a pleasant place to sit and sip your coffee or meet a colleague for a snack break. If Keith is there, ask him any random question you want and you will be entertained for at least twenty minutes as he spits his opinion. Apparently he's some sort of poet or sumpin... And make sure you ponder a clever Ruckus pun before arriving to make your visit more entertaining. Just don't expect it to be better than Keith's Ruckus puns :P Cock-a-doodle-doo! They sell t-shirts! Busy night! See all photos from Chad A. for Cafe Ruckus",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Came in for some coffee before a movie.  The shot of espresso was one of the worst I've had - lacking sweetness, complexity, flavor.  It's highly possible that the beans they use are old and the espresso just isn't setup right.  I'm seriously confused by the great reviews here, but then again, most of the reviews are for syrup drinks.",0
Coffee Shop 7,"This place is great!  First of all the coffee is great.  Keith, told me that it's their own blend and I really love it.  I went down there a few Thursdays ago and listened to Today Castillo play in the shop to maybe 20 people in a SILENT audience.  It was perfect, what a great space.    Final thoughts?  MORE DRAFT ROOT BEER!",1
Coffee Shop 7,This is such a friendly coffee shop on the Amazing 2nd Street in downtown Austin.  Coffee and Pastries are perfect! LIVE Music on Thursdays too!  You should go!!,1
Coffee Shop 7,I love the barista with the mustache who works evenings. He makes the best cappucino! He takes pride in his work. This is a really cute place!,1
Coffee Shop 7,"The coffee is legit, especially the After Dark Roast!! The atmosphere is everything you can hope for from a coffee shop and they have board games to enjoy as well. Perfectly suited for the town.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Probably the friendliest customer service I've ever gotten, honestly. Also, the Mexican Mocha is ridiculously tasty.",1
Coffee Shop 7,Love this place!  Great people watching. Good location. Love the chai! Environment is cool and casual. Very welcoming fun staff.  I'd be coming back for game night on Mondays!    I ordered a 'Strong Chai' and got one of the best Chai Tea Latte I've ever had anywhere.  The pastries are awesome and fresh.  The espresso and iced coffee are the best in town. I think it's the machine and the beans are roasted locally.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"The atmosphere is retro and casual, the hours are good, the location is great for late night people who like to take walks downtown, and the prices are way too fair. I mean, I got this ""small"" (16 oz?) delicious Mexican hot chocolate for $2! A friend of mine got hot coffee which he greatly enjoyed too.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Evening snack, chocolate croissant & cappuccino...",1
Coffee Shop 7,Great friendly service and one hell of a iced chai . Definitely coming back .,1
Coffee Shop 7,"I am so glad this place exists. Not only did I feel very taken care of as a tea-drinker (ask for Rori's tea menu!), but this place has some fun specialty drinks and  a solid selection of caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverages. The pastries are yummy, too, and they've got ice cream -- which seems to be a hit with parents and kiddos who stop by after hitting Toy Joy next door.  The atmosphere  is charming, quiet and cozy, but still manages to be fun -- they have board games, after all.  The staff is friendly. Cute place for a date in the evening, and a relaxing place to get some work done during the day. I met a friend there on our lunch break, and I left feeling refreshed.  Update: I came back in during a warm day, and I have to say -- their ICED Red Berry tea is to die for!",1
Coffee Shop 7,"It's cold out and it seemed like the perfect day for hot cocoa.  Was dissapointed.  Got the standard and it pretty much tasted like sweetened milk with barely a hint of chocolate.  It was really light and way to milky.  It was only a shade darker than milk actually.  I asked for cinnamon and whipped cream, got a tiny bit whipped cream and no cinnamon.  Guess it could be an off afternoon.  I'll give them a second chance, we'll see.  My co-worker got a milkshake and loved it.",0
Coffee Shop 7,Love this place!  The relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff create a perfect environment to enjoy homemade sweets and coffee while listening to local musicians.  One of my favorite places in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 7,Wow!  Ruckus is a neat spot downtown.  I had the pleasure to meet Keith and he shared his knowledge of coffee with us.  Great coffee stop downtown.  Put this on your list of local places to visit.,1
Coffee Shop 7,"Cafe Ruckus is a quintessential, friendly, and easy-going coffee shop. The coffee itself is great, and the atmosphere is perfect for a quiet meeting, place to work for a while, or just to stop by for a few minutes to get a caffeine fix. They also seem to have a great selection of loose-leaf teas. And root beer on tap! Unusual, but I love the variety. Also the staff is really friendly. There are a bunch of places downtown that are trying really hard to be either oddly upscale or hipstertastic, but this place just feels down-to-Earth and comfortable.",1
Coffee Shop 7,"Was in town visiting and had an opportunity to try this place out. Very nice, great cappuccino and pastries, very comfortable place. Nice area to just sit inside or outside and chill.  And, of course, they have Wifi.  What more do I need?",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place looks very unassuming on the outside but its a very nice, quaint transport to a world of awesomeness. It's definitely a place I can see an Austinite sitting down on any given day to work at a cafe.  The owners are really nice charming people, knowledgeable and passionate about their gelato, knowing how to appeal to the italian roots they're proud of in their gelato as well as tastes for the american palate.  That said, EVERYTHING I tried was off the charts amazing in flavor. Smooth, velvety gelato that's not too sweet, with fresh cream and fruit flavor (for the fruity ones). I think particularly noteworthy are the cannoli and stracciatella - the stracciatella as an all around favorite for our group and the cannoli has bold vibrant flavor. I personally liked the cherry as well - tasted sweet, like fresh picked fruit. Cream cake is also good if you're into that kinda thing. And though the cheesecake looks very fruity and you'd imagine denseness, its very light and comes off the palate with a very clean cheesecake flavor (the fruit compote type jam on top helps cut the richness I guess).  All in all, you can get a cup of happiness for not that much more than any other ice cream shop in town and you clearly can't go wrong, so come on by.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Mmmm the gelato is so tasty! I came here for a dessert date and had the Tequila flavor with lime and blackberries. It was very fresh and had a teeny tiny taste of tequila in it. I would love to come back and try some of the other flavors and baked goods.  The inside was very clean and stylish. Only downside was a small parking lot and lacking in outdoor seating. Also, it'd be nice to have more variety in coffee. Other than that I like this cute cafe!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"If you're looking for a relaxing European coffee shop experience in the midst of a an increasingly boxy South Lamar--here is your oasis! This gorgeous little Italian cafe and gelato shop.  Operated by a delightful couple of folks (the gentleman can whistle like a Disney bluebird!), this place has coffee that tastes like you're on vacation and treats that are flaky and scrumptious. The ambiance is as balanced and sweet as the gelato. This place will chill you out and improve your afternoon. It's worth a little splurge for a Perfect 10 cafe! Cheesecake gelato and also a Coffee-type that was seriously so insanely DELICIOUSAAAAAA. Treats and Gelato",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Cute little shop run by a gorgeoussssss couple. I mainly came here to try their gelato donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family, so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime, which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate.  The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes, but mine was filled with vanilla gelato on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the experience, but the taste of it was only decent. The gelato filling is kind of melted and frothy, which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything, I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise, I'd stick to their regular gelato selections.  My mom and older brother both got gelato cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia, which is the very liquid, smooth and creamy, dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their cheesecake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach gelato. Cappuccino is delish too. Just get everything. ;)  Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left, but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here. Next time, I'm having my eyes set on their coffee and more gelato cups. Display case. Beautiful gelato flavors!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I don't know. There seems to be another gelato place here in south Austin popping up with a few more. I'm pretty sure we will see a season of Gelato Wars on TV or in the newspaper. I have to admit though I don't know what is good gelato or bad gelato. As long as it doesn't make me sick, I'm fine with it.  I see photos on yelp for gelato shaped like donuts. Immediately I must go and check them out. Luckily they had a banner which said GELATO out in front otherwise I would have been wandering up and down Lamar looking for this place. The parking lot is small and space is very limited. Once you get inside, it's a cute, modern cafe with one case full of the gelato donuts, cake and tiramisu. There's another case full of the gelato. You can ask for a sampling of the gelato and I had the cookies and cream with cappuccino. As a result, it was pretty good gelato. Strachelli and cappucino Tiramisu and donut shaped gelato",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Great Gelato and friendly service. Dangerous that this place is almost within walking distance. My GF got the stracciatella and said it was just like the kind she used to get when living in Rome (she hasn't been able to find any like it since getting back to Texas). The gentleman that served us also mentioned that they will soon have fresh house made cannoli which are one or my guilty dessert pleasures, so we will definitely be back very soon.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Food: 5.0 of 5.0 Service: 5.0 of 5.0 Environment: 5.0 of 5.0  Great tasting Gelato at an expected expensive price. This place would be a nice place to take a date on after the movies or eating downtown. Service is very polite and patient. Inside!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Venezia Italian Gelato is run by an Italian couple. I had a moment to converse with the owner (the kind lady) and she was so sweet. She works practically all day--wakes up bright and early to make the gelato and service her customers.  I got the 2 scoops of gelato for $4, which isn't bad. I had the hazelnut and peach gelato. The peach was very peachy (duh, right?)--it didn't taste artificial or bland. It has a hint of sourness, but a great flavor for a hot summer day.  They only allow you to try 2 samples and ask that you keep your spoons for environment's sake, which I fully appreciate. Overall, I'll give this place 3 stars + 1 star for the lady's service. The decor was nice, definitely a great study spot.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Ahhh gelato. Takes me back to summers in Germany, and traveling the canals of Venice. There is something so delicate about the flavors, compared to ice cream.  Venezia Gelato does not disappoint when it comes to bringing that delicacy from Europe. A small with 2 flavor choices is about $4.50, with a medium being 3 choices for .50 cents more. Quite the steal compared to other speciality ice cream in Austin.  However, I'm floored at the interior of the shop. Ultra modern, with everything in black and white. Large windows face Lamar, and Mom's Tattoos. It's very clean, and neat, with some relaxing music playing in the background.  Obviously a family affair, they greet more family who shows up in support. Out of the 3 flavors I tried, cappachino, pecan and hazelnut... The hazelnut was my favorite. Will be back to try new combos! My ice! Beautifully displayed Lovely selections",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Ice cream donuts? Yes, it is true! They make donut shaped Gelato goodness and I am not sure what the outer coating is but I think just cream/sugar/yogurt and the inside is filled with gelato. We visited here the other night and my husband ordered THREE - he just could not stop eating them. I had a couple samples and ordered the vanilla and chocolate, so original I know, but they were good. I am used to the type of gelato that is more icy and not so creamy, but this is still good.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I have definitely been on a gelato craze, so I was happy to discover a new spot sort of close to home! The parking lot is kind of small / hard to navigate through, so it would be best to try to go during non-peak hours or after the business next door is closed for the day! (they have about 3 or so spots reserved for that business).  The decor is absolutely beautiful! I loved the black and white theme, if I hadn't decided to stop using snapchat, I would have been snapchatting very inch of this shop. Even the gelato was beautiful! But let's move on to the flavors...  I ended up ordering a small with mint & apple cinnamon. The flavor choices I picked were probably not the best combination wise, but they were both so good, I couldn't resist. My partner ordered a small with cherry & passionfruit. I thought the coffee flavor was great, but I was so insistent on the apple cinnamon, I chose to forgo that since THAT flavor combination would've been even more weird! Overall, I thought each flavor I sampled was great, it was a matter of which flavor I wanted. The biggest thing I noticed about the gelato was how light/icey it was. I've seen to grown to like more creamy textures, so I was a little sad when it wasn't as creamy. However, I would come back & recommend others to check it out! Small mint & apple cinnamon, small cherry & passionfruit",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Came with my friend 10 days after they opened.  First impressions: lots of seating, very beautiful decor.  Their gelato was pretty good. 4/5 stars because comparatively to other places in Austin, I wasn't blown away.  Their mint gelato was REALLY good, however. Exceptionally.  Because of their ample space, would be great for large groups of friends to hang and enjoy some gelato. Good selection",1
Coffee Shop 75,"My friends LOOOOOOVE this place. They come here once a week.  I thought it was very good & the owner looked very nice.  Cherry cheesecake was good-- looked amazing with graham crust crumbles on top. I thought it could use a little more cream cheese but that's just me. Passion fruit was really good-- tart & rich. The hazelnut chocolate is suuuuuuper rich and delicious but maybe too rich for most people.  This is a good, safe place to get gelato. They have flavors that are very typical for most Americans (""donuts"" ""vanilla"" ""coffee"" ""mint"" ""chocolate coconut"" and have a few exotic flavors ""passion fruit""",1
Coffee Shop 75,"There is a lot of hoopla about gelato places in Austin and I just haven't seen what all of the fuss is about. Most of them don't offer what I consider real gelato. Venezia is in a league far above the rest.  Nicola and Alice are not only awesome people (Nicola in particular also has a great handshake), but they're slinging some awesome gelato too and the clear best in Austin in my opinion. It's even as good as what I've had in Venice, Italy where they hail from. They have genuine passion for what their creating here that you can easily tell and taste.  I first came over a month ago and last came a week ago and see they are getting busier and busier which I love. I plan on coming much more. I'm a big fan of their espresso too. There is now real gelato in Austin to enjoy! Ben fatto!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Simply awesome. This is the place for gelato. When I was in Austin I was a regular here. Neat and clean decor, very nice people and the mix 2,3 scoops options are really good. All gelatos are made from scratch and u can feel the freshness in the flavor. We had capuchhinos as well. Everything is just perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Omg this place is so awesome and the gelato is DELISH!!! I have a dairy and gluten allergy and had me covered! The gelatin was definitely the BEST in town. Super fluffy and smooth! I Highly Recommend this place! The owner is from Italy too! He knows his stuff. From Italian to Italian this is the BEST place for gelato in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Ooh talk about authenticity! The Italian couple who opened this moved from their home about a year or so ago. Love the store layout and the gelato (please do not call it icecream) is so pleasing to the eye! They also have vegan flavors. Got the dark chocolate along with raspberry - both were vegan (I'm not vegan but it works in my favour since I'm mildly lactose intolerant) but man oh man, you cannot tell it apart from dairy ones. This has to be THE best dark chocolate gelato (or uh, ice cream) I've ever had in the world.  Owner and the employee are very friendly and nice to talk to as well. Going to keep coming back for it! What a yummy display. Sadly we didn't have tummy space for this.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"After a lousy day, I wanted to bring my wife here as a little treat.  I'd read the great reviews and was hopeful they'd have some great gelato, and we weren't disappointed.   We tried a few samples of flavors including cheesecake and passionfruit and everything was tasty.   In the end we both went with pistachio and cherry which was made with a tart Italian cherry and was absolutely delicious.  The pistachio was nicely rich and nutty with real pistachios and not the fake green dyed atrocity you find at a lot of places.  I got a macchiato to go along with the gelatos and it was rich, roasty, and really went well with the gelato.  The owners were both very friendly and I wish them lots of success here.  We at least will definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Listed in 100 in 2016 It's such a pleasure stumbling upon delightful little local places! Venezia was one of those stumbles.  Decent parking for it's S. Lamar location and spectacularly clean on the inside, I had high hopes from the moment I walked in. The woman at the front greeted me with a huge smile immediately and made me feel welcomed and wanted. She patiently waited as I decided what to order. Great customer service! Venezia serves up various flavors of handmade gelato and coffee. I stuck with the Gelato this time around, but would love to try their coffee too.  A small gelato gets you two decent sized scoops for  $4. The best part is that you can choose two different flavors, even with a small order. I ordered the cheesecake flavor and the chocolate biscuit flavor. Both were amazing! The gelato was perfectly creamy and each flavor was strong and distinct. I also tried the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip which were equally amazing.  I recommend coming here for a tasty pick-me-up. You won't be disappointed by the exceptional customer service or the amazing gelato!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Yummy yummy Gelato!!!!!  We drive through S. Lamar quite a bit and every time we pass this place I always say ""I want to go there."" Well we finally got the chance to and our experience was amazing!  We both have had gelato before. L.C. had it in Italy and myself in Hawaii (lol lame, I know). But the owner of the place is so so so sweet, and so welcoming. Educating us about gelato, the flavors, and how he makes them daily. We love to see people passionate about their businesses. Especially L.C. he loves conversation!  A tip: you can taste 2 different flavors at one time to see if they combine well! We got a kick out of that.  The sizes are small (2), medium (3), large (4), and they refer to how many scoops you desire. We both got mediums. They are open late too so perfect for after dinner! The flavors we liked were chocolate coconut, pistachio, cappuccino, black biscuit (Oreo), hazelnut, & mint.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"nice sweet treat. a little pricey 4 dollars for 2 scoop of ice-cream on the cone, but they are organic ice-cream, clean and no chemical which is a plus..  I love hazelnut favor. yum....",1
Coffee Shop 75,"My friends told me this was _the best_ and they weren't lying! This is my new favorite dairy treat spot in the entire city.  Venezia is a welcome addition. I'm a sugar snob, and I take my ice cream products seriously. I've had gelato everywhere from Rome to Richardson, and this is by far the best. Creamy and delicate, every bite was amazing. The flavors were the typical gelato flavors (hazelnut, pistachio,) with some extras thrown in (cookies and cream, strawberry cheesecake) and three vegan flavors for about 12 to 15 flavors to choose from.  I couldn't decide and had strawberry cheesecake and cherry. Both were rich and tasted so FRESH. It was like they had made it right in front of me (they didn't, but you could have fooled me). The service was super-friendly as well.  I highly recommend this place; just be sure to leave me a parking spot.",1
Coffee Shop 75,I have been DROOLING over the photos of the Mr. Ring for a few days now. I FINALLY got to try their gelato and Mr. Ring...  OH. MY. GOSH. It was delicious. I finished my Mr. Ring before I even left the parking lot! I love gelato and I love chocolate covered anything...so this is the perfect marriage of my 2 favorite things.  I sampled some of their gelatos and they were so delicious! The pineapple gelato is dairy free and tastes like I'm eating a pineapple! YAS.  What's even more awesome about this place is that their gelato is non-GMO and artificial color free! WOO HOO. I'm a total convert. I'll be walking over here so I can eat one Mr. Ring there and eat one on my walk home.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Awesome addition to the growing South Lamar food scene and a great dessert or decadent snack option. Authentic gelato with creative and sophisticated flavors with the added bonus of luscious Italian pastries and exquisite coffee.  Even a modest selection of gourmet sandwiches. Great vibe, upscale decor and gracious owners/hosts.  I've had gelato in Italy and this is the real deal.  Easy to miss if you are not watching for it--almost across the street from Snooze.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Updated review Wonderful experience of incredible gelato. Clean environment with plenty of seating and amazing selection of flavors and combinations.  Owners offered tastings of any of the selections and I ended up Peanut and Dark Chocolate.  Tiramisu and cheesecake are also popular items.  Highly recommend trying this out!  Get the Venezia flavor.....absolutely the BEST,1
Coffee Shop 75,it's simply amazing. the gelato is the best I have ever tasted. one of the best places to eat gelato in Austin. also owners are super sweet.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Updated review Awesome gelato !! Love the place, the flavors! Best gelato in Austin. Period. Chatted with the Italian owner. She's super knowledgable about heathy eating and why gelato is better that ice-cream. Definitely coming back many times. Awesome !",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I'm joining the chorus to say that Venezia is fantastic! Everything about my pop-in for a gelato on a sweltering summer afternoon felt authentically Italian. The proprietor is friendly and proud of his offerings, the flavors are familiar and yet somehow elevated, and the store is modern, spotlessly clean, and surprisingly large.  I went for a traditional pistachio and hazelnut for my first visit while my friend opted for two fruit flavors. All were so delicious that we were plotting our return trip before we left the store.  I want to tell everyone about Venezia because it may be a little less showy than some of its counterparts around town, but it is damn fine gelato. The real deal.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Love love loveeee this place!! I'm glad I found this new hole in the wall. It's easy to miss this place and turning into it is kind of hard -- but I assure ya it's worth it. I've tried other flavored but I ALWAYS get black cherry and passion fruit. You get two scoops for a small size so you can pick 2 flavors,1
Coffee Shop 75,Excellent- highly recommend. Most authentic gelato eatery in Austin not to mention a welcoming staff and fantastic ever changing flavors! A must try !,1
Coffee Shop 75,"After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety are exceptional...to say they are incredibly delicious is such an understatement!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the owners have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,Stopped in after dinner with a few friends for something sweet. Glad we did! Really enjoyed the dark chocolate and mint gelato combo I created. My friend had the pistachio and it was gone before I could even try it! Tutto perfetto.,1
Coffee Shop 75,This place was authentic. Very very very clean. Highly recommend to at least try it. 2 free samples are given. It was delicious to say the least.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Excellent gelato, espresso and owners. It's as authentic as you can get in Texas. Loved my first time there and excited to go back.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"3 check-ins My wife and I met Alice the owner, and we were welcomed in a very friendly manner.  The owners are brand new here; they came here straight from Italy so you know this is the real deal.  Compared to the other gelato places in Austin, this place's flavors are lighter but still taste very desserty.  The consistency is more like ice cream -- but healthier I guess? Right?  You must come here nowwwwww.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I've been trying to decide whether or not I should keep this place a secret. But I want them to do well and figured, I shouldn't be selfish. So here I am writing a review for the best gelato I have ever had.  Venezia is located off of South Lamar, right next to a tattoo shop, and if you blink, you might miss it. It doesn't have flashing lights waving you down saying ""THE BEST GELATO HERE"" but it does have the Italian flag, which pretty much says they're legit, no?  Upon walking in, we were greeted straight away with warm smiles. The owners are so sweet and friendly, and that made my whole experience that much better. The wife took care of us, allowing us to sample whatever we pleased. I tried the Passion Fruit, to which she made sure I understood to try the whole sample at a time, so that all 3 layers of flavors would mix together. And boy was she right. As soon as I took the entire sample, my eyes grew bigger and she could see that I was amazed! It was so delicious, words can't even begin to describe it.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Hazelnut and Passion fruit gelato. No regrets there.  The decor inside is cute and simple and if I could, I would live here. When we left, the owners said their thank yous and I quote, ""ciao"", still with smiles on their faces. It was 10 minutes before their closing time, and they still had a positive attitude.  From the moment we stepped foot into the place to the moment we stepped out, they were welcoming and I can't rave enough about the service here. The gelato was fantastic but the experience was even better.  I want this place to stay open for a while and possibly for forever. I want this husband and wife duo to succeed, so go. Go out and support this business, because I have never felt so much love for and from a place before. Passion fruit on top and hazelnut at the bottom",1
Coffee Shop 75,Amazingly perfect! The inside ambience and the people makes it a must visit place. I read the online review and went there to get Mr.Ring! The owners gave me a warm welcome and they offered to decorate the Ring for the occasion.  Service was one of the best. The owner also offered me few flavors of Gelato to try (even though he knows i was not there to buy gelato). The flavoring was top notch.  Will be definitely back to try their coffee range and buy more Mr.Rings and gelato! Best place to hangout.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the Ferrero Rocher gelato. I had it served with one scoop of the coffee flavor in a medium cup, where I quickly ate up the coffee just so I can savor the Ferrero Rocher. It was total bliss and I was immediately saddened that I didn't go up one size.  The amiable Italian owner added an even sweeter impression to our first visit. We asked him about the Tiramisu and even though my boyfriend didn't understand his accent, he was sold by the man's passionate description and tried it out.  I didn't even bother to try the Tiramisu, nor the Mr. Ring's (gelato donuts) which I originally went in for, after sampling the gelato. I'm now on a mission to find a gelato place in Houston that tastes as good, if not, I'll be coming back real soon!",1
Coffee Shop 75,I have been looking for a gelato cafe for a while and I found it. This is my favorite place for Gelato! The Ferrero Rocher gelato is wonderful. The people working there are very nice and the cafe is very clean,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Updated review 2 check-ins I was literally in love with this place. I had admired their selection and ambience. My last experience white washed all of it. The male owner was so rude and that you could feel it in his tone. His words we sharp n pinching. I received a response from him and that too was full of arrogance!! I respect rules and policies of the businesses but there is something called as customer service and politeness which is almost non existent here..Never gonna go back and will stop recommending this place :(  My previous review:  Ok... M confused !!! I was in Love with this place Coz of amazing tastes, excellent interiors & decor and great customer service. The couple who manages the place (I thought were amazing).  I actually love the lady she has excellent customer service skills, so polite and great.  But today, I had a bad experience. I was so happy to take one of my friend who was visiting me to a great Gelato place. Yeah I understand it's Saturday they have many customers but it doesn't mean the male would be rude .. Very rude. As I stepped in they were few groups before me. They went ahead tried the ice cream and they were being served by the lady .. She was cheerful , polite & nice. Since there were couple of people so they male guy took over the serving. As my turn arrived .. He was rude and said u can only try 2 flavors.. That's ok. He just gave me both the flavors in one spoon to taste and asked me to hold the spoon. And even told my friend u decide n keep what u want. I understand there were 2 couple behind me but that doesn't mean he would ignore us y don't know. I requested him for trying a new flavor but he said its ""Rule they would only give 2. But we saw people before us were given whatever they wanted to try. I am feeling embarrassed my friend felt so bad the way he behaved and talked with us.  I respect their policies & rules but then it should be the same for all customers.  Parking is a pain since only 6-7 spots... Arrogant Response to my review from the Male owner.",0
Coffee Shop 75,This place is absolutely amazing! The people that work here including the owner are so sweet and helpful... They are real Italians which makes the lace so authentic.  The gelato is amazing!!! Just as good as the gelato I had in Italy. The coffee is even better! Definitely a cool spot to come relax and have some coffee and fun donut gelatos!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"2 check-ins Venezia was one of the few places that stayed open late on a weekday evening, and when we walked in we were greeted by very neat decor and the happy faces of our Italian-accented hosts behind the counter. The gelato was very good; I had salted caramel and something else I don't recall. I do recall that my wife and I were quite impressed with it, enough to promise ourselves a return visit. We'll be back.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"My family and I are quite fond of gelato, so once we heard there was a new good spot down south, we had to stop in and try it out.  It wasn't that difficult to find their business, but the parking lot is small.  They allow two sample for free before making your selection.  My son chose a small with two flavors, my husband had a waffle cone, and I chose a medium because I wanted three flavors.  I had the passion fruit, mango, and cappuccino.  I think the passion fruit was my favorite because it had a thin layer of chocolate and was the perfect combination.  We all enjoyed our treats and will definitely return next time we have a craving for gelato.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Very good authentic Italian gelato. Great espresso also. The owners relocated from Italy and are very passionate about their gelato. Nice people. Found my favorite gelato in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Amazing. I loved the cherry gelato. I also had the Italian cream, which was eggy and delicious, and the crème brulee which came with raw sugar on top. Everything was good. The store is very cute and I love that they serve espresso. My girlfriend really liked the stracciatella. I only wish they let you try more than two samples. That cheesecake flavor was calling to me, but I'll have to save that for another day.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I had the MR RING and it was AMAZING!!! Also, they let me sample a couple of gelato flavors who he were equally as incredible! The service is great and very helpful and the pricing is reasonable. I can honestly say this is one of the best gelatos I have ever had and will definitely be going back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Updated review 5 check-ins Still just as good as the first day I visited, but I would reconsider coming if you have a nut allergy. I brought a friend who does have one and found out that she couldn't have anything there. The owners only have one mixer since they're still new and they use it for every thing. I don't believe they have a sign up for that, so hopefully this gets the message out.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Friendly Service and Awesome Iced Coffee. Definitely recommend the cherry gelato too,1
Coffee Shop 75,"I had a small sized gelato, half cherry and half pistachio.  Gelato was nice and smooth. Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,The real deal traditional Italian gelato in Austin. Not sure what to write other than go here for the real deal. Still love Dolce Neve for non-traditional tastes but If you want a true Italian experience in the heart of Texas this is THE place. As an Italian man in Austin I can attest to the Gelato being true to its Italian roots.  Bravo!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Austin needs more spots like this. The gelato is very tasty, and the coffee is great. We're excited to see what Venezia comes up with for their breakfast menu... We went in today and learned that they are serving breakfast from tomorrow.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Not to toot my own horn but I'm sort of an amateur gelato aficionado of sorts. I sometimes pull an all out Ratatouille and spit out freezer burned ""gelato"" out of my mouth in Austin because let's face it, most of the gelato here in our great city is not legit.  Enter Venezia Gelato. This great couple has been in Austin for a year straight from Venice and they serve up the most authentic gelato on this side of the Atlantic. I seriously haven't had better gelato in Seattle, LA, or Vancouver BC. So I am extremely happy we have a great spot here in Austin now.  My favorite surprise was the chocolate which was almost a frozen high quality cake frosting (the only way I know how to describe it which doesn't do it justice) which paired extremely well with my cookies and cream. Not to mention Italian true espresso to complement the ice cream and close out the day. The decor was modern and quaint and this would be the perfect spot to bring a date for lunch or after dinner. Bravo!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I tasted two of their specialty gelato flavors and found both to be very sweet - much sweeter than any I have had during my various trips to Italy. I think there is better gelato to be had in Austin.  The decor was quaint and clean in a modern-Venetian style.  Oddities: 1) Your two samples (limit) are put on the same tiny spoon, so one will affect the flavor of the other. 2) Arriving just after opening, I was surprised to sit at sticky table. 3) There are only six regular parking spaces and nowhere to park on busy Lamar Blvd. (There might be three more available after business hours at the place next door.) 4) Their website cookie policy is in Italian legalese and literally-translated English, which is unintelligible. You must agree to it to access the site, so be aware that you could be agreeing to give up something dear to you.",0
Coffee Shop 75,"First off I have NEVER posted a review before. This place is soooooooooooo amazing that I just had to. They serve authentic gelato, tiramasu and chocolate mousse. They even make donut shaped gelato pops. Mmmmmm. The dining room is so beautiful and clean. The staff was very nice and the hours are perfect. Open til 11 Tues thru Thurs and til midnight Friday and Saturday. Check this place out. You will fall in love!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,Made a special trip to try this place out after seeing such great reviews. I went for the Mr. Ring and it was delightful and decorated beautifully. The mint gelato may seem like a basic choice but I assure you it is a choice you can gladly make.  The owners described their offerings to us with such passion which really added to our great experience. Here's hoping they open a second location that I can get to more quickly!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"""I'd have to get a second job if this were closer to our house,"" said my husband after our first visit here. Every flavor more delicious than the next. Super authentic gelato. I'd say this has claimed the title of best frozen dessert in austin.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Mm they had a hazelnut nutella type gelato in summer. Coffee gelato is good. It's right next door to the tattoo shop. (I missed it driving past last time) They have delicious gelato & the man & woman who own the place are from Italy & so nice & welcoming & always having good conversation with the customers. A perfect gelato business we're lucky to have in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"BEST GELATO EVER!!!! I spent a summer in Sicily and tried a few other places in Austin that I like, but this place is hands down the best dessert you will ever eat! The owners are an adorably sweet couple and the actually remembered me and my friend a month later at our 2nd visit! It's kind of tucked away on Lamar and hard to see so I hope the word gets out. They let you try any flavor, but it's so hard to choose! Seriously you have to stop by",1
Coffee Shop 75,"After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety cannot be matched!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the owners have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Best gelato in ATX (and believe me, I've tried the all). The only bad thing is that all of the flavors are amazing and it's impossible to decide which one to get. I ultimately got the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. The nutty flavors in the pistachio and hazelnut are incredible. And the cherry is not too sweet and made with luxardo cherrys, giving it a ton of delicious depth. Only other place I've had gelato this good is Italy! Best gelato in ATX! My favorite flavors are the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. But you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"The best homemade gelato I have ever eaten. First time I would say that it wasn't as busy as it should.  Get in there now it's amazing.  The owner is super sweet too, great local business.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"I noticed this new bright light beacon in the night as I was driving through my hood down Lamar. And was pumped when I noticed it said Gelato. YES YES YES! So I tired it out last night. When we walked in, I was in love with the decor, the open air of the place, and the super friendly owners and their family that was there. They said they just opened and seemed so excited to show us their products. I've NEVER seen Gelato like this. I think that means all the other ""gelato"" places in Austin, most likely aren't the real deal. My gf and I tried pretty much all the flavors. They were amazing. I don't know how I picked just two! I can't wait to go back and see more new flavors each week. This is great, so close to my house, and so yummy! A WIN FOR '04!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"We just discovered this place and we are very excited. The gelato is so yummy, and the have donut shaped gelato. My kids loved it. They can even put your kids name on them if you order some for a party! Unlike other nearby by ice cream places, there are lots of tables to sit at. The owners are so welcoming and friendly too! This place is definitely one of our weekly outings. It feels like your in Italy! See all photos from Linda T. for Venezia Italian Gelato",1
Coffee Shop 75,The best gelato! Super friendly owners! Great collection of insanely delicious vegan gelatos as well. Passion Fruit Gelato! Must try!!!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"As someone lucky enough to have lived in Italy for more than a year and eaten my way from village to little village being sustained sometimes only on gelato, I consider myself qualified to give review of this new gelateria. And it is truly divine. Does not leave you feeling heavy. Just leaves you feeling high on the taste of natural handmade gelato. I see a lot of gelato in my future!!! The proprietor is the real deal. You can tell he loves his gelato. Gelato heaven at Venezia",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This is real Gelato, you can taste it. It is made with high quality ingredients. The owners are super nice and they know their craft. The pecan gelato is beyond belief and the cheesecake was creamy but not greasy at all, honestly, really good!! Main Entrance",1
Coffee Shop 75,Words cannot describe the love that is put into this gelato. The owners are so incredibly friendly. They want you to try every flavor. It's soooo good!!  Best gelato in ATX. Get the Antonella. It's like Nutella but gelatotized.,1
Coffee Shop 75,Wow wow wow. Amazing gelato and 100% authentic and natural ingredients. Owner is simply awesome. Must thry the Venice chocolate. Best Italian gelato in town and I have tried several great ones!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Hands down, the best gelato I've ever had. In fact, I'm not sure I can even say I've had proper gelato after having had theirs.  There's so much flavor packed into each scoop and their flavors are phenomenal. My personal favorites are the chocolate hazelnut (imagine Nutella but 1000% better) and passion fruit.  The owners are so friendly and kind which only adds to it all.   My Italian friend says this is as close as it gets to what you find in Italy and I'll believe her.  Plenty of parking and places to sit and enjoy this little gem of a place. It's quiet now because they just opened but it's not going to be long before they're packed out.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"The very BEST GELATO in Austin TX! Beautiful location, great service and incredibly good gelato, the same flavor as in Italy, I'm Italian so I know ;) They also have cakes which I will be ordering for my son's birthday!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place is amazing! We were looking for coffee the other day and found it. They saw us waiting outside and opened early for us. The owners are so sweet and the coffee is unlike anything i've ever had before. They gave us a taste of the gelato and I will DEFINITELY be back. It was so creamy, smooth, and delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Authentic, top notch place. From the gelato itself, to the interior design - loved everything about it.",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Its the best Gelato in the town. Awesome tastes. So many flavors, and I was confused which one I should take. I took pistachios, spanish cream and passion fruits flavors, and my wife took coffee, yogurt. Also took cappuchino. I dont know how to express the awesome flavors. It rocks! Cappuchino",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Came here one evening as I was in the mood for a late night treat. The owners were super friendly and their gelato did not disappoint!  I tried a couple of different flavors (the Venezia was amazing!) and all were incredibly rich, smooth, and delicious. I ultimately got a cherry, pomegranate, and passion fruit combination which was to die for. The fruit flavors all came together perfectly.  I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area and looking for a tasty treat!!",1
Coffee Shop 75,This place is a must if you want authentic Gelato!! Try the cherry gelato. The gentleman helping us explained that the cherries are shipped from Italy. I have never had cherries that delicious. And they combine it with the gelato! Winning!! I can't wait until our next trip.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place deserves nothing short of 5 stars. I ordered a medium (3 flavors) with passion fruit, hazelnut and Texas pecan. These guys know what they are doing! I couldn't resist the temptation and ordered two more scoops of straciatella and the Venezia. Venezia is the best flavor I have tasted in gelato. It tastes a lot like the inside of a ferrerro rocher. This is now my weekly dessert spot!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Amazing, amazing, amazing. Beyond the delicious and authentic gelato, the owners of this establishment are beautifully educated immigrants from Italy who completely embody the American Spirit. Their dedication to their craft of exquisite Italian desserts is an amazing addition to the Austin community. Clean, sleek and modern environment and a friendly staff. Thank you and we will return next time we are in town!",1
Coffee Shop 75,A two sample limit that comes across as insulting. The gelato is good but seems airy and cheap in a way. Not my favorite and there are better places close by that let you sample until you find something like.  Hahahahahahaha. You have to read this owners response!,0
Coffee Shop 75,"If you do one thing during Texas' neverending summer, treat yourself to this authentic and creamy gelato! You won't be sorry since it has 65% less fat than traditional ice cream so you can come back frequently and taste their 400 flavors! It totally took me back to my favorite gelato shop in Rome, and it even has colorful gelato on a stick for all the kids and kids at heart! Alice and Nicola are true Italians with Texas hospitality so check out their business the next time you are on South Lamar, not too far from Barton Springs or Lady Bird Lake. Divine!",1
Coffee Shop 75,So thankful for a quality gelato shop in the hood.  Love the local feel and the husband and wife owners are so charming and hospitable!,1
Coffee Shop 75,"The hazelnut and pistachio flavours are absolutely delicious!! Will be back soon ;) but the lime was only meh, and I am not a huge fan of the black and white decor- seems a little harsh",1
Coffee Shop 75,Yum!! And the owners are from Italy!!!! Cute shop and super friendly! The gelato pop was amazing! And the hazelnut and pistachio gelato to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 75,The real deal Italian gelato. Home made on premise. Owners are from Venice are super nice. The salted caramel was divine and the cappuccino was like frozen tiramasu. The black cherry was off the hook and the cherries are sourced from Italy. If you're on south Lamar this is a must stop for an afternoon treat or an after dinner dessert.,1
Coffee Shop 75,I fell in love with the gelato!!!! They have so many good flavors and treats. I would recommend this to everyone but keep in mind that if you have a peanut allergy you can't eat here ! The staff was very friendly,1
Coffee Shop 75,"This is the best gelato I have had in Austin, TX for the past 5 years that I have lived and visited this town. My favorite flavors are the Venezia and hazelnut, but you can absolutely taste the quality of fresh ingredients and care that the owners put into all of their gelato. The gelato itself is so rich, creamy, with flavors that really stand out.  I actually met the owner when I went in the shop today and he is genuinely kind which helped make this my new favorite gelato spot here in Austin. Venezia can promise an authentically made gelato because the owners are actually from Italy and have a really cool family history of being in this business so you can be sure they'll do things right.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Authentic Italian gelato-Great variety of flavors and natural ingredients. Awesome place to come and relax with some gelato & a beautiful coffee. Decor is on point ! A little taste of italy. Yum !,1
Coffee Shop 75,"On a hot July night in Austin, this was absolutely the perfect remedy. The authentic feel of the place complimented with the French speaking girl dipping made this a fantastic experience. Got the black biscuit and cannot wait to come back for more!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"The best gelato in America. The passion fruit gelato is incredible. Great customer service, very friendly. A husband and wife team from Italy who make gelato with skills straight from Italy.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Have been here a few times now. Some of the best Gelato I have ever experienced(including Italy). Taste is so fresh! My wife likes the vegan options and has not been disappointed.,1
Coffee Shop 75,I had heard about Venezia back in June so when the opportunity came to check it out I was pleasantly surprised. Great gelato and afterwards we had espresso which hit the spot. LOVE this place.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Great service and prices. Its the REAL DEAL. They are from Italy ad it was nice to have that taste once again. I have missed REAL gelato from Italy since Ive been there before. Nice gem. Clean, great owners and practiced my few words of italian. They have all italian products. Really awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"Tried this place for the first time tonight, it was great! The hazelnut gelato is some f the best I've ever had! The cherry is absolutely delicious too. My husband got the cherry and pistachio and said it was great. The husband and wife owners are very sweet, will totally be going back!",1
Coffee Shop 75,"This place is incredibly inconspicuous but absolutely delicious! The flavors are incredible, especially the cheesecake gelato. The owner is incredibly friendly and the environment is relaxing.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Great addition to the South Lamar neighborhood.  REALLY NICE true Italian gelato.....,1
Coffee Shop 75,What a fabulously authentic Gelato spot! Flavors are delicious and the atmosphere a little Italian and a little Austin rolled into one modern space. Definitely a place to come to for a deliciously cool treat on a hot day.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"In short, it's the real deal.  The creamy gelattos are incredibly rich and have great texture.  The fruit gelattos aren't oversweet, and have strong natural flavors.  The dark chocolate was perfect, and the hazelnut was just as strong.  They also have a number of vegan options.  Venezia compares favorably to the best that you might find in Italy, and now sets the bar for Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 75,SUPPORT THIS PLACE. It warrants all caps. The husband and wife team from Italy put their hart and soul into what they make and it shows. They will make you feel welcome.,1
Coffee Shop 75,Delicious. Totally authentic Italian gelato. The pomegranate was so fresh and the Venezia chocolate-amazing.,1
Coffee Shop 75,"Great gelato. I'm Italian and visiting this place felt like stepping into an actual Italian gelato place, in the middle of Texas.",1
Coffee Shop 75,Just tried the hazelnut and cheesecake gelato. Husband had the Ferrero and coffee. So delicious and authentic. Our favorite was the hazelnut. Some of the best gelato I've had.,1
Coffee Shop 65,"Updated review 6 check-ins This place is home. It's home enough to make me want to drive from northeast Austin to south Austin to have a couple beers and listen to some live music.  Great selection of local beers, good coffee, good Philly cheesesteak stand, music most nights of the week. Buzz Mill is where I go when there's nowhere else to go.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Definitely not a place for coffee or chai latte. It took forever to be ready, I stepped outside to check on my bike, headed back in and was told "" chai was sitting outside for 15 minutes ""...not to my knowledge or eyesight!! I was never announced for 15 minutes while standing inside and worst when made the point it was cold - just as a feedback- got an attitude from the coffee staff. Chai also tasted awfully diluted. How can you mess up with chai? It comes as a mix!!!! A $5 rip off (mistakenly tipped as paid).  Very sad since it should be about customer service. Will never come back and would not recommend anyone to come here for coffee or tea:( My lukewarm diluted Chai latte.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"3 check-ins Ok, the coffee is excellent, the music is great and the staff were incredibly friendly.  Love this place.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"This place gets a 5 star for simply having the best bloody mary.  We went for brunch and I planned on just having a tea.  Of course, my husband looked at me in disgust and said ""what do you mean just a tea?'  (we were on vacation and it was odd for me not to get alcohol with every meal) so I snapped out of it and said you're right make that a bloody mary and I am so thankful I did. They have a homemade pickle infused vodka, which I must say I was iffy about, but it was AMAZING.  To make the bloody mary even better they have a bloody mary bar where you can add any garnish you wish...and boy did I add everything offered!  As far as brunch goes, the food was great and the atmosphere was nice (don't let the front of the building deter you).  Definitely give this place a try! Bloody Mary with pickle infused vodka Bloody Mary bar! Bloody Mary bar!",1
Coffee Shop 65,Coffee and beer? That is one question you need to ask yourself here. The night I was here the Answer was beer and booze. I had a beer but my husband had the pecan whiskey. Wow! What a nice smooth drink.  I like the fact you can hang outdoors or indoors. You also have an option to grab a bite at the food trailer 1776 cheesesteak company. I highly recommend and I reviewed it if you wanna know what to order.  We stopped here before heading across the street to Emo's. A perfect pre game stop. Enjoy! An old rusty fan Delicious food trailer See all photos from Amanda K. for The Buzz Mill,1
Coffee Shop 65,San Matcos location It's gooood.  Burger is juicy. People are hot and laid back. Drinks are strong.  Looking forward to the future,1
Coffee Shop 65,"I met a coworker here after a LONG day at work and tried a citrus beer that they had on tap. After i had my drink I realized they have a lot of house made alcohol which I regretted not trying. But, it is a great spot to drink, people watch and catch those Austin vibes. Places like this remind me why I made the big move and service was great. In my drinking, I came back in time to catch some tunes from a local band who had the whole outside area jamming to their cover songs as well as their own original tunes. I'm always a fan of good live music and they delivered. Big time. I can't wait to get back to try their brunch and mimosas. If you know me, I'm a lover of those. I am eager to try their coffee as well, as I hear it is quite good. That's my other vice, good coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Listed in 2016 Yelp 100+ Austin Texas The Live Music Capitol of the World, My Favorite 4 Star Places I met with a group for a cupcake contest for the Halloween month. This is not my typical cup of tea but with such a great group I just had to do it, even though I did not have any opportunity to bake. That is fortunate for others as my concept was simple yet brilliant. So here I go to a place for the first time. This is definitely a dive, but a friendly one, with a great mixture of ages and backgrounds. Hey, if I was running for office in Austin, this would be my campaign headquarters! I really wanted a Bloody Mary, or 5, but I could  not have any alcohol, so a sweet and generous lady of the group figured out a sparkling water and OJ combination. Perfect! Parking is on two sides. The vibe here is excellent. Old style Austin with a mix of generations. A lot could be learned by blood sucking politicians in just listening and watching. What a great time! I actually lived only a few blocks away at one time and knew the old area well. It was good to be back. Carrot Sexting a cupcake See all photos from Larry E. for The Buzz Mill",1
Coffee Shop 65,"This is a cool spot- good beers, infused liquids, food trucks, and live music. I've never had their coffee or food- definitely more of a bar spot for me, weird to think of it as someone's morning cup of joe haha :)",1
Coffee Shop 65,"When I first came here I could have sworn I was transported back to Brooklyn. The people (in some ways), cocktails, food...but then again, it looks like an old time saloon...so gets you back in TX.  Very chill outdoor setting and I was fortunate to come at times when a country-ish style band was playing which added to the vibe.  Oh, and they have a fire pit.  On one occasion, came here at brunch time on Sunday.  Had the ""range grits"" which is venison and antelope on top of grits.  It was excellent but smallish portion relative to the price.    The coffee is good.  For those of you that like to work out of cafés,  this could serve the purpose.  However - the wifi was not great one of the times I went...worked out fine next time though.  Friendly, helpful and efficient service. Venison on grits Fire pit raging",1
Coffee Shop 65,63 check-ins some of the tastiest coffee in Austin ! Get the iced carmel latte with almond milk or a cold brew for $2! Super friendly baristas and good breakfast tacos,1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins Tuesday - live music that was chill, bluesy but not too overpowering so conversation was possible in tables away from the stage and inside. Decently full for a week day.  Dranks: There is a bloody mary bar that is pretty fabulous (on the weekends? don't quote me on that) but it offers a variety of coffee beverages, beer, and coffee spiking options so meeting a buddy for drinks can include the alcoholic variety or not.  Food: I've tried a vegan quiche? or some other vegan item I was unimpressed with and ended up feeding to a hungry ridgeback (his eyes asked politely) and the inside furniture is not the most comfortable, but I might just be nitpicking. The food trailers run out of food sometimes (like the bbq trailer) so get it while it's hot, but the options are pretty good for a coffee shop.  Parking: There are lots on both sides of the coffee shop, so don't let your maps app confuse you and use the back parking if the front is out of space.  Space: The ample seating outside with picnic tables and benches are good for groups small and large to sit together and move around comfortably. Overall worth the buzz. Hah. I used a pun.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Wow, this place just exudes the Austin vibe! It also has amazing cheesesteaks, great espresso, and the friendliest staff in Austin. Buzz Mill is also extremely pet friendly (cheesesteaks are served from a food truck) and the best for last, GREAT beer selection at affordable prices - *Tip* PBR is always just $2 if you're really on a budget and remember to put the Whiz on your cheesesteak, it's simply not the same without it.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List I've been here a few times now at all given hours of the evening/late night and I am still not sure what to make of this place.  They seem to have an everchanging revolving door of food trucks, parking always seems to be a hot mess, and the baristas are either the most pretentious or nicest people you will ever meet.  if you are a somewhat discerning beer drinker (like myself) where the only time you drink a plastic cup of PBR is when you're playing Flippy Cup, trying to figure out what they have on tap is like a draught version of Wheel of Fortune and getting side-eye and all kinds of Austin hipster shade because you dare ask what the Karbach they are currently serving is when there are 8 people behind you in line is not my idea of a fun evening. Seriously, print a damn beer menu or put it on a chalkboard somewehre?!  The crowd here is also a weird eclectic mix of the entire Austin population.  I did enjoy a recent local artists art show in the little back corner of their patio. This place definitely has its regulars and is attractive to certain demographics, but alas, I am not one of them.",0
Coffee Shop 65,One of my favorite spots to go to study off campus because it's out of the way and not as packed with college students. There's plenty of outdoors seating and is connected to some food trucks if you get hungry!,1
Coffee Shop 65,"I have no idea what their drinks are like, but I do know how their service is like. Beyond the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. I went to Buzz Mill to enjoy my night with my deaf community and it was my first time trying this place out. I heard that they have incredibly delicious mixed drinks and the environment was nice. You could either sit indoor or outdoor. Dog-friendly too which was a bonus!  I was about to order a drink for myself and my friend, but we and the rest of the deaf community were refused to be served. Apparently, the manager had one sour experience with a deaf customer and had decided to stop serving rest of the deaf community. What in the...? We all were enjoying our night away with great energy and positive vibes.  To make things worse, the manager started to yell and cuss at us when we tried to reason with him. I was baffled at how he treated everybody. It was completely unnecessary and inappropriate for the deaf community to experience this audism from the manager of Buzz Mill. I definitely won't be visiting this place again.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"Staff is remarkably ignorant of Deaf people and how to interact with Deaf people. Yelling at a group of Deaf people accomplishes nothing. They apparently have never heard of pen and paper, which is even more atrocious when you consider this place is in AUSTIN-where so many Deaf people reside.  Where every single staff member at other businesses has shown sensivity and understanding.  And even worse, yelling at a group of Deaf people and getting mad when they don't ""listen"" (d'oh) at Deaf Night Out, when you had the potential to have 100+ new customers..  you LOST 100+ customers.  Way to go.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"So.............kind of a throwback beer garden. New age hippies, hipsters and young folks. I'm surprised no woman was nursing a baby. This place has a funky vibe and I love the music stage because it's just the right size for small bands. They also have a cool variety of beers on tap and in bottles. Go by and warm up by the fire, grab a cold beer and you just might hear 1977 in the background. What? No nursing baby?!?!?",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Some nice beer and a good sized venue.  All spoiled last night as bar staff unfairly cut off service to a large crowd of Deaf people enjoying a social night out. Apparently one or two had caused a problem, but for one bartender this meant all the Deaf people were in his words 'guilty by association' and around 80 people were forced to close out tabs and refused further service.  Other than the alleged incident - that seldom few in the garden area even knew had taken place - nobody else was even close to causing any kind of trouble; it had been a very chilled evening until this point and our experience was soured by this blatant act of discrimination. Many of my friends were left shell-shocked and any attempt to explain or placate the situation was shrugged off by the bartender, who became more verbally abusive than any patron I had seen, visibly flipping off customers.  To their credit, other staff members apologized for this situation as they came to collect glasses, but this experience really soured my time in Austin and I will not be returning to this bar.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"Updated review Stopped in for brunch. Very inefficient system involving a server running back and forth to a food truck in the background. Waited forever for food to come out. Eggs were undercooked (I'm talking runny whites, not runny yolk). Besides undercooked eggs food was ok but not standout.  I won't be back for food I don't think.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"Love this coffee shop/bar so much. One of the best things we like about Austin. It's laid back, services great coffee and beer plus tons of cool infused vodka and other liquor concoctions. Plus an outdoor stage for live music and food trailers to the back for BBQ and tacos. The perfect combination all around. Also love that they have a quiet room where you can work in peace without annoying people on the phone, talking loudly etc. oh and did I mention they're pretty much open all night?? Play a game of jenga in the awesome patio area...",1

Coffee Shop 65,"I've had the brunch biscuits and gravy and the elk hash, both were quite tasty.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Great coffee and  fun atmosphere! I loved the strong and rich flavor of the decaf americano that I ordered. I was here around 11pm on a Friday, and the place was very lively and active (especially outside). They have an open outdoor area with many tables and its own small bar. Inside there was  a quiet side study nook, which I will definitely be back to utilize! I liked the unique decor and music as well. The only reason I'm going with 4 stars is because it wasn't super clean. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"3 check-ins Ambiance: Pile on the plaid, but leave the axe at home. This is as Appalachian as it gets in Austin. The cozy inside resembles a lumberjacks cabin adorned with a raw wood bar, bear decor, and rustic, intimate tables. The outside it vast and open with community seating for large parties or social butterflies. They also have smaller tables for parties of 2-4. The stage often hosts musical acts, or BuzzKill comedy every Wednesday, but you can escape the noise if you want a quiet night on the side of the building or past the back bar. Hip bulb lights and a fire pit light up the space and allow clear visibility even on the darkest night.    Cuisine: There are, how I see it, four options to eat at Buzzmill. All are good options. 1. There is a randomly opened food truck that serves mostly burgers, but also Sunday Brunch. 2. There is 1776 Cheesesteak that I should write a separate review about, since it's so good and authentic. 3. There is a small selection of sandwiches and healthier items in a cooler inside. 4. There is tons of beer for those on a liquid grain diet.  Service: The line to the bar can get a bit long, but I believe the new bar system and the addition of the outside bar will alleviate this issue on even the busiest nights. I am a repeat customer, so I get treated well at Buzzmill. Overall the staff is great. Especially the coffee guy, Hey Thor!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Filthy restrooms-not gender specific which means, ladies get ready for a urine drenched yucko toilet. Blech. After using the restroom and holding my nose because the bathroom stunk of urine, I slunk out. Also servers were completely absorbed in their own private conversation so they didn't even see me come in.  So technically I did not even try their coffee. I figured if you are cool with filthy restrooms, then best not to drink your coffee.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"I visited on New Year's Day and absolutely intend to return. The staff were manly and agreeable, and the space was rustic and simple. Quite simply,  it's a good place for a 1990s esque coffee break. This place gets a bonus because I love that there's a boozy bar conjoined to the coffee bar for Irish coffees, and that the cost of a whiskey coffee runs $6. Also, amig@s, check in on yelp and get a dollar off!  It's peaceful and quiet inside, particularly in the back room where I was able to begin and finish Gillian Flynn's new short story.  I'd be interested in seeing standing catered food options from regional classics like Taco Deli and Swedish Hill;  when I went the food truck out back was closed and so I went without. Boys,  feed me AND give me a quiet place to read over my boozy coffee, and I'm all yours.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Love the concept of this place: want to study? They've got coffee, free wifi and a ""quiet hall."" Want to meet up with colleagues or friends? They've got indoor and outdoor seating, beers on tap, and original infused liquors like pecan whiskey and grapefruit gin for cocktails. Want to soak up the rays with your favorite furry friend? Dogs are allowed in the outdoor areas. Hungry? Buzzmill's own Ironwood BBQ is cooking from 11 to 11, and numerous other food trucks frequent this place. Prices for coffee ($2-3), beers (there are 5 dollar drafts and $3 PBR), and food ($7-11) are all reasonable. Plus, check in on yelp and you get $1 off a coffee drink!  Whether you're looking to wake up or wind down, this open-24-hours coffee shop and bar is a good choice. PS, try the lemongrass rose gin--it's phenom. Cucumber melon rum, pineapple blueberry rum, strawberry basil mint vodka, spicy mango tequila, and many more.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins I just love this place so much. Just SO MUCH. I study here, I get drunk here ... I love it. $2 PBR pints for when I'm feeling cheap. A $5 craft beer when I'm feeling fancy. Maybe some crazy infused whiskey. Or cold-brewed ice coffee if I don't fee like alcohol (hardly ever).  I mostly order ""The Bear Hug"" tho. It's $5 for a shot of whisky and a pbr.  **food trucks have changed in recent months. It's now Ironwood BBQ and a Cheesesteak place that offers a vegan option!  Always entertained by the live music or comedy. Except holy crap when a band is playing you literally CANNOT have a conversation. They blast the music so damn loud. So if it's a date don't go sit outside expecting to get to know each other during the nights/times there's a band. Unless of course you think it could be an awkward date... in that case DEFINITELY go so y'all don't have to talk to each other. Whatever.  They have outlets some areas outside for lap tops so that's good to know in case no space inside. You can grab Apples to Apples, Battleship, Connect 4, etc. from the shelves in ""The Quiet Hall"" (literally exactly what it sounds like). AND IF YOU'RE STUDYING IN THE QUIET HALL DON'T BE A DICK AND TALK ON YOUR CELLPHONE. some ppl... mannnn....  AND OF COURSE MY FAVORITE PART... THE STAFF! Everyone is so damn nice. Which you may not get that first impression probably just cuz they're super busy a lot but since i've been going there often you get to know everyone and they are all super fucking rad. Alan, Santiago, Mike, Rocky, Seth, Desiree, Esteban, Travis, everyone else I'm forgetting... LOVE YOU GUYS! Chillllllllen with a $2 PBR",1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins It doesn't matter if it's day or night, the Buzzmill's open and waiting to pour you a beverage. This lumber-clad cafe/bar is open 24/7 and makes about a dozen house-infused liquors as well as a strong cold brew coffee. Why not combine the two into a cup?  The large courtyard has a firepit and a lot of picnic and high-top tables to chill with your friends. There's always people around, even at 2AM on a Sunday night (ok, technically Monday morning). Free wifi, food, and the aforementioned beverages make this a great spot I visited several times during my long weekend stay in Austin!

Coffee Shop 65,4 check-ins The coffee is good. Place is not bad to get too. There are many choices of drinks to choose from depending on what time of day you go to. The staff is very friendly. Worth checking out.,1
Coffee Shop 65,"This has been my favorite bar in Austin ever since I hit legal drinking age. Not only is it a bar, but they offer caffeine fixes 24/7 for all my studying needs. I've spent countless nights studying my ass off here.  Plenty of seating (they constantly add more tables/chairs), food trucks out back, Voodoo donuts, board games, infused alcohol, the best/nicest bar staff in the city (most of the time)...I could go on and on but this is just a place to experience for yourself. A good mix of people for people-watching as well. Every time I go, they have some kind of new addition. I hope this means they are doing AWESOME and will stick around for years to come. Love y'all, Buzzmill!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"3 check-ins Okay...can we say east side chill? It's pretty much my local hangout. Log cabin interior, resident stuffed bear, and infused whiskey makes this place wicked bad! Add to that the food trucks out back and the free wifi and its a great place to hangout after work, before bed, or on the weekend.  The AC isn't that key inside and inside there's some limited seating out front. There's a bunch of searing outside, but in this heat even in the shade it's oppressive. Great in the winter time.  Also...I hear the coffee is good. I'm no coffee drinker, so I can't attest. But, what I can say is that I did get a cup of coffee from buzzmill one night when I was making a red velvet cake for my boyfriend's birthday and this cup made the recipe outstanding!!!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"I don't care about plaid I just want my drink......  I have been going to Buzz Mill for about 2 years now. I keep giving it another chance, but I am done. The outside setting is awesome and there are some cool comedy and open mic nights there. However, their main attractions, beer and coffee call up a bad experience for me 2 out of 3 times.  Their draft beer is frequently flat. For a year the beer out of the coolers was warm. I think they have the temperature taken care of now, but flat beer is pretty inexcusable.  Lastly, their coffee. The only way to spoil a good tasting coffee for me is a bad attitude. Some times at Buzz Mill I get a server who is  just plain rude, sometimes the server is doesn't even look up or hand me my change, instead just putting it down on the counter and turns away. This time I was told my 2 lattes would take 10 minutes. I stepped outside for 5 min. When I returned my coffees were set to the side un marked and mixed up. When I asked about it the server said ""They were sitting there for a long time so I moved them. I'm not sure which one is which.""  This kind of service isn't ""cool"" or ""hipster"" its just bad. It keeps me from spending money there. That sounds like a bad business to me. I'm bummed it didn't work out.  P.S. The AC is rarely ever working. Studying there is a bit frustrating because of slamming doors and spotty wifi.",0
Coffee Shop 65,We went there for brunch on Sunday with a big crowd and That place is awesome!! The manager was super nice and would stop by our table some and see how everything was.  The staff was equally friendly. And I like the music that was playing. It's fun it like frontier land.  I had the Elk Chili Hash with two fried eggs!! OMG so good!!  The outside patio is a great place to bring your pooch - but please keep it in on a leash. And part of the tables are covered - it's very relaxing out back!! Even with some people smoking it was not bothersome.,1
Coffee Shop 65,"Overall, I don't get the hype. Came on a wet weather weekend to get some work done.  Pros: -Tons of seating, both inside and outside -serves both coffee and alcoholic drinks so it can be a study spot or a social spot -staff were friendly and easygoing -they are really hardcore about their themed decor. Kind of cool, not my taste. I think a lot of people could appreciate the change from the usual coffee shop  Cons: -I'm no coffee expert, but this was NOT a good cappuccino. It was so sour that I couldn't finish the drink. Maybe the barista was new, but I was not a fan -the ""quiet hall"" was dripping rainwater, and you could clearly hear staff conversation and loud music. It sounds like a good idea, but it just didn't pan out for me -not a fan of the seating in the quiet hall; it's a lot of one seater pews with little tables. Good for isolating yourself for work, but not the most comfortable",0
Coffee Shop 65,"Place is awesome. Good coffee, good atmosphere, good beers, good cocktails featuring a bunch of infusions bla bla bla. Would have given it 5 stars but the bartenders are your run of the mill Austin dooshery that think they are way cooler than everybody and give you the classic attitude and the whole cliche bit. Good news is there really isn't any seating at the bar so you don't have to listen to them talk to each other for all that long. All that being said it's a great spot and I'm sure they are fine people, at some point",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Not the worlds greatest coffee, but the infused liqueurs are a welcome change to the standard bottle options at other bars and the outside area is as laid back as you can get. A lot of people bring their dogs around which I love and staff for the most part is friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"awesome place for comedy on Wednesday nights. Beer is decently priced and they have an amazing fire, if you can find a spot. I kinda forced my group to have a spot near the fire. Such a cozy spot to listen to FREE comedy on a Wednesday night and enjoy a beer and laughs. Keep it up Buzzmill",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Stopped in here really quickly to grab a hot tea and hot chocolate for the road trip home. The staff were friendly and the ambiance was very warm and inviting. I can't say much else because I was only there for 5 minutes, but I would definitely stop by again.",1

Coffee Shop 65,11 check-ins My favorite neighborhood coffee spot. Good coffee and the guys who work there are really great too. The art all over the inside makes it a fun spot to work for awhile or just relax with a cup of coffee. I've heard it's fun at night when it turns to a bar but haven't been at night yet.,1
Coffee Shop 65,"once was enough and that sums it up. I'm certain i'm not hipster enough for this joint. Though I can see why ppl flock here. Coffee, booze, outside (shareable tables), infused liquors, looked like some local snack (tacos and more tacos) a mini fridge with light bites, and live music. Thought the evening i was there i wouldn't call what i was hearing music by any means-to each their own. I would do a drive through and grab a quick drink. Not a hang out spot for myself,",0

Coffee Shop 65,"4 check-ins Listed in 365 in 2014:DONE!, Dive right in! Buzz Mill is a really unique, cool spot in east Austin. Drive up, see the massive sign, park, get out and look around...and suddenly you realize you've stepped back in time to the Old West or as others have stated ""Lumber Jack Land!"" Greeted by a huge stuffed bear at the entrance and then to the wood carved coffee/bar counter...watch out for that beaver sticking his head out! Buzz Mill is certainly themed; however, not overly done (a.k.a. cheesy). Divey, yet somehow a tad trendy at the same time.  Vast coffee assortment. Local roasts available. I don't indulge in the caffeinated stuff, but my husband ordered a cup of simple drip ($2; $1 after getting a $1 off Yelp check-in offer!) and he said it was great. Smelled good! I was also thrilled he wasn't buying from overpriced Starbucks (yup, I am a hater of the corp!). Buzz Mill apparently offers great coffee and the prices on the board are certainly appealing. Great java for ya dolla!  This ""coffee house"" also has a full service bar. A few beers on tap, some in bottles, and an inviting assortment of over two dozen house-made infused liquors (""elixirs"") such as Apple Cinnamon Whiskey, Blackberry Sage Tequila, and Pineapple Rum. Having had a ""pickle shot"" before and really enjoyed it (I know!), I opted for the Spicy Dill Pickle Vodka. Umm...very very strange. Not very dilly, and ""spicy"" = nutmeg and cinnamon spicy - not chile', hot pepper ""spicy."" None for me again thank you. Also had a $2 Hamms - cheap beer for cheap price- call me happy cheap person.  Next, into the ""backyard."" More wood ""fort-like"" stuffs about. Large space with plenty of tables, dog water bowls everywhere (super pet friendly - yay!), a small stage, and two food trucks! - BBQ (Blue OX) and Vegan Tacos (The Vegan Nom). If you're hungry, which we were, oddly different choices but both great......yes, we sampled a bit (ok, large samples) from both trucks. Couldn't resist.  So visit Riverside, grab a drink of your choice, head out to the patio and enjoy some meat and/or tofu, hang out with cool people and even cooler dogs...and...just enjoy!  TIPS: The Buzz Mill coffee bar is open 24 hours; both food trucks stay open late, even on Sundays.

Coffee Shop 65,"The service is often slow, but it's a great atmosphere and they had a good choice of coffee and infused liquor. I really enjoyed the pecan whiskey and DrPepper. They have had good live music the last few times I've been here too, so it's nice to have a choice to sit inside and chat or sit outside and take it all in! It's well worth the visit. Be prepared, there isn't much parking here.",1

Coffee Shop 65,"ROTD How have I never heard of this place until now?!  Thanks to a great tip from Do512 my buddies and I headed over to try their $7 bottomless flapjacks. It's tucked away in a super sketchy area of E Riverside but is SUPER cool on the inside. Awesome woodsy decor, friendly staff, nice large outdoor seating area. Lots of games on hand if you're hanging out.  The flapjack breakfast was great. Comes with bottomless flapjacks, 1 slice of bacon and scrambled eggs for $7. You have to purchase $1 tickets for extra bacon or eggs. Bloody Mary's are $4 in pint glasses with an awesome assembly bar set up. Kick ass!  Coffee is cheap and tasty. AND it's 24 hours!

Coffee Shop 65,"10 check-ins I first found this place to experience their version of Oktoberfest.  I am so glad my friend dragged me here, as this is not a typical place I would have stepped into on my own by just driving by, and boy would I have missed out on a treasure.  This place is so unique and eclectic, and truly has something for everyone.  Not everyone could make such a diverse place work, but this place hits all the right notes for a 24 hr. spot.  I truly hope that with all the urban trendy construction going on around this place that this logger lovers haven doesn't get engulfed or over run.    Buzz mill is a wooden shack with a large fenced in outdoor wooden fort like paradise complete with one of the best BBQ food trucks - Blue Ox.  There is a wooden stage, covered eating area, and some tables out in the open.  You will even find a large wooden Jenga game to play with.  Inside you will find some seating, board games, and free wifi.  If BBQ isn't your style, there may be something to eat inside.  You can get some vegan breakfast related items brought in from outside vendors, or select from a menu of smores for dessert and roast your own marshmallows at your table.  For beverages you have quite a few options, draft beers, infused wiskey/vodka, and quality espresso coffee drinks.  I am picky with coffee, and the espresso here is great.  I haven't yet had a chance to try the infused drinks.    They also partner with Blue Ox for a Sunday Brunch.  They host a Bloody Mary bar for $4, and $2 Mimosas.  All of which are yummy.  A unique community gathering spot which hosts it's own lumber society, sword making nights, and other unique events.  Definitely not to be missed.

Coffee Shop 65,"5 check-ins 24 hour coffee shops in Austin are often overshadowed by Epoch and Bennu. I have been guilty of this myself until I discovered The Buzz Mill!  Don't be intimidated by the bear logo sign at the front; it's actually quite a welcoming place. If you can get past the lumberjack feel, then you will appreciate:  1) It's a 24 hour coffee shop WITH BBQ! Whaaaaa? That's right, who needs baked goods and stale bagels for a late night snack when you can get some meaty, fatty BBQ. For clarification, The Buzz Mill is a stand alone coffee shop, they just have a food truck called The Blue Ox that serves BBQ. They operate in conjunction, but The Blue Ox stops serving at 2 am, or until they sell out. I'll write a separate review just for the BBQ. 2) The atmosphere is a little bit of everything. When you first walk in there are big tables for group study. Then walk past the ordering bar and you'll see a strip full of cubbies for 1, 2 or 3. This part was my favorite ^_^ There's also an outdoor campfire area where the occasional band will put on a show. Andddd, THERE'S A HUGE JENGA SET! Life is complete when you have a huge jenga set. Oh, this is also where the BBQ food truck is.  Some things you might not appreciate:  1) The tables in the cubbies are kind of small, especially the ones for 2 people. It's definitely going to be a squeeze for your stuff so you might want to reconsider bringing your 50 pound Intermediate Accounting book. 2) If you're a coffee fanatic, bad news. There's a very limited coffee selection. Not really a problem for me, but I know it bothered the friends I came with.  I came here twice in a span of 4 days and I'm positive I'll be back again. This is the new and improved Epoch/Bennu. Cubby area Cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 65,"The amount of blind dates I've seen here is startling. Maybe because it's got a huge outdoor patio with food, music, a fire pit, and 2 food trucks..so there's plenty of distraction if things don't go as planned. They're open 24/7 which is rad, they have about 8 different infused liquors like berry lemonade vodka and grapefruit gin, as well as coffee drinks and beers on draft. The food does seem to shut down pretty early, as well as the live music, but it's still a chill, Texas feelin kinda place. I go here to study/work a lot too, they have a secret quiet room with some booths that are good to spread out and get some work done on. I've been here 3x in one day, no shame. Riverside needs more places like this, show some support and skip Starbucks! Came here with this little babe",1
Coffee Shop 65,"I am an Uber driver so I like frequenting coffee shops. This particular establishment offers Uber drivers discounts on the coffee drinks, so I thought I would try it.  The first time I dropped in, a large man named ""Shannon"" I believe was his name, was there as the barista. He has a big beard, tats, and usually wears a hat. Anyway, he had the REM song ""Everybody Hurts"" blasting and seemed very annoyed that I was there ordering. I almost wanted to apologize for interrupting his state of melancholy and disenchantment. I left and rung that one up as an employee going through a break up or something along those lines.  The second and most recent time, as of Saturday, the same employee was in fact very rude and inappropriate with me but also my wife. She asked him if they had iced tea. His reply, ""We have tea."" My wife, ""What kind of teas do you have?"" Employee, ""We have tea."" I then went to order a coffee and told the newer employee, a young woman, that I was an Uber driver. She asked him how to enter the discount, and IN FRONT of me, this guy says ""Uber drivers never tip."" I actually always tip baristas anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar. I even tipped a dollar this time, said to him I tipped, and he replied ""You're one of the few that do."" NOT EVEN A ""THANK YOU"" OR ""I'M SORRY!""  I gave a one-star review because the service is absolutely terrible. So next time beware of the large man with a beard, tats, and the ball cap.  Even though I live within walking distance, I guess I'll be headed to Starbucks where the coffee definitely tastes better and the service is above and beyond what Buzzkill, err Buzzmill offers.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"Best coffee anywhere; period which includes Hawaii, Mexico and all of Europe. They have large jars of fruit infused top shelf liquors-ummm; great cocktails. Dog friendly patio, cool vibe. Excellent breakfasts!  Best place to take visiting guests. Very friendly helpful staff. Bring back the brisket please!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Very chill environment and sometimes you get lucky, like tonight and get some live music! The Irish coffees are what we come for....add a little of their specialty infused whiskey in it and you'll keep coming back to! By far one of my favorite places to drink and catch up with friends.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins More like Buzz Kill... Came in for the 1st time, not knowing what to expect, but hoping for a Good Time... Unfortunately thats not what I got though. After bar hopping we stopped in here based on a friend's recommendation, but Yikes...the 2 bartenders inside were Dicks to put it lightly. Before ordering, we requested to taste a couple IPAs & asked basic questions, the bartenders basically rolled their eyes as if we were wasting their time. Our group were the only people standing at the bar, and after a drink, we rolled out. Not gonna waste money in a place that treats customers like dirt.  Service: WORST....Sucked!  Beer Selection: Great craft beer selection  The place was pretty cool looking inside, and offered an outdoor patio area towards the side of the building, as well as a food truck out there.  I seldomly ever write bad reviews but this place wasn't at all the cool place my friend had described in the past. Customer service...probably the worst ever in Austin.",0
Coffee Shop 65,Not sure what the big deal is about this place.  I've only been served by one employee who was friendly.  The female bartender is the only one I've had a decent exchange with.    The last time we went here I was with a friend who doesn't order coffee drinks very often and didn't realize that she needed to specify whether she wanted her chai tea iced or not.  It was about 95 degrees outside so she just assumed that it would come chilled.  I told her to ask them to exchange it for a chilled glass.. No big deal right? Wrong.  They made a huge deal about how she should be more specific and in the end refused to swap it out for her.    She's a sweet girl and non confrontational.  I ended up having to go inside and talk to the cashier to at least give her a glass of ice so she didn't have to drink a hot beverage on an already sweltering Texas night.  After some back and forth with the staff justifying their position I was able to get the glass of ice.  Nicely done fellas.. get a life.,0
Coffee Shop 65,"This place was def a gem I was not expecting. The atmosphere is great. The little treats are interesting. I went to get some studying done and was told this place was great for it. There is a small area that's ideal for hitting the books, if it wasn't so crowded. I went in the afternoon and people were already ordering shots of vodka, that should tell you how I fared with my studying. No complaints seeing as how it is a cafe/bar but I think the majority of the noise came from the staff. ;p That being said the treats are interesting. I've always wanted to try a maple bacon donut and had it been filled with something like a custard it would've been perfect. Limited coffee menu which made it easy to pick out the chai as my choice of drink. I've had better. Will definitely come again if not for the log cabin feel or lumberjack men behind the bar.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins Austin surprisingly has a dearth of 24 hour places. For a city that's a buzzin all the time, you'd think we'd have a plethora of spots that cater to the night owl crew. Not so! Enter Buzz Mill -- with something for everyone.  A bar: Delicious cocktails, infusions, specials and craft beers? Yes please! Their bar has a hearty selection of just about anything you want and more. I had an house infused vodka rocks the other day that was downright dessertlike.  A coffee shop: Are you a coffee snob? Come on over, friends! Their coffee is outrageous (and outrageously strong.) Not only that, but you can buy growlers of their cold brew!  A restaurant: Or more accurately, a food stand. The pork loin and brisket at Blue Ox are some of the best I've had. And I've eaten some meat y'all. They've got the OG Franklin smoker and they are doing great work with it.  Put on your plaid flannel and head on out to Buzz Mill. It's kind of hard to find (look for the DQ sign) but it's one of those special Austin places that Riverside is going to grow up around. See all photos from Kelly S. for The Buzz Mill",1
Coffee Shop 65,The food tasted great. I got the brisket and my friend got the ribs.  The only thing I didn't like is the very small portion of meat and the fact they only have small bottles of Mexican coke for $2 I was expecting more for the price.,1
Coffee Shop 65,It would be more aptly named Buzzkill. New to Austin and no rookie when it comes to coffee or business.  Wanted to give the local coffee joint our business over the Starbucks next door. So-so on the joe and fail on the personality and service. Look people. We get it. It's early in the morning and maybe you've had a rough night.  Suggestion: Stay home.  Starting the day with good coffee...a must!  Having it handed to you by an engaging barista who appears to want your business...definite bonus if want return customers.  Suggestion--Acquiesce.  Go to Starbucks and continue searching.,0
Coffee Shop 65,"Beer and coffee. Tis' is all. Oh, and bbq!  Excellent place, walking distance from my apt. Live music is also a plus.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"9 check-ins I'm almost a regular here...just need another week in Austin.  They don't seem to close. There's a whole area in the back to work with outlets. They have a cache of board games to play, and a huge outdoor patio with food trucks.  They serve up the usual coffee shop drinks and teas. They also have a full bar with a dozen liquor infusions, and a decent selection of beers on draft. I'll see if I can rent an apartment upstairs from this place.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"I REALLY like the vibe at this place. Really wooden, rustic, communal, homey. They had a fire going, chairs everywhere, pecan pumpkin whiskey and live music. I can definitely see myself hanging out here more often! The BBQ my friends got looked really good too!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"First off, a great neighborhood bar that I love getting food, inhouse infused booze, and dirty chais from. Beyond that, I really dig having a 24 hour cafe to walk to during my insomniac writing hours. My favorite spot after working crazy late hours for the service industry. I've come to love this patio.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"When you want a slightly dirty little coffee bar with a dirt floor seating area outside, a few good beers on draft, and a little stage from which you can hear some great country or blues, you probably want the BuzzMill.  I've always found the drip coffee to be a bit lacking (it always tastes a day old), but their barista's make a good shot of espresso and get their americano's just right. They don't have many beers, but the ones they do have are rotated regularly and are always great.  Ample parking, and lots of bike parking. Very dog friendly as well (thanks to the outdoor seating area).  Food wise there are two food trucks outside, and they often have tamale's inside (which are excellent).",1
Coffee Shop 65,"20 check-ins Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge in 365 days, Rise and Shine for Breakfast Finally!!! Somewhere awesome close to me. I didn't know this place existed. I found out about it until I went to Walgreens before I went to work. It's the feeling of looking for a treasure without really looking for it.  It was hot and humid. Instead of going straight home to the comfort of my AC and watching TV, I decide to go ahead and check out The Buzz Mill. I loved it. I decided to get some coffee.  It's small and dark on the inside. If there's no room then you go to their patio which is pretty awesome as it reminds me of one of the bars on Rainey Street. Patio has various games such as a homemade skeeball called a Skoo Ball. Brilliant piece of homemade DIY wood work if you ask me. Then there was giant zenga, cornhole, card games and other games.  The cool thing also...it is open 24 hours and it's close by! Score! So beautiful in the early morning hours. That's right fools....SKOO BALL!!! It's on!!!! Patio full of board games, cornhole, skoo ball, giant jenga.",1
Coffee Shop 65,4 check-ins Butchest place ever and dog friendly. Very cool coffee/beer place and it has a great outdoor space. I came here for stand up comedy (which you should totally check out). Would recommend during nice weather or if you absolutely need to be in walking distance to lots of tacos.,1
Coffee Shop 65,"Live music, outside, dogs, drinks,  food with great staff... what more could you ask for?  Maybe an amazing beer selection? Yup, got that.   Incredible infused vodka options?  Yup, that, too!  The bartenders and staff were super friendly and helpful when I was undecided.  Super attentive.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Kind of has it all. Pretty good draft beer selection as well as lots of coffees. They have a more ""quiet"" room for studying/reading or soft conversation and it stays fairly quiet in my experience. Sometimes their main room area gets a little loud, but there's always the cool outdoor area too. Firepit, games on the tables, food trucks, and sometimes live music. I've been there to meet friends I haven't seen in a while on many occasions and its always easy to talk and catch up, or play the games outside like apples to apples. I've also been there for morning coffee or to work in their quiet area.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"I love this place. The consistently have outdoor music, cool people, and delicious infused liquors. The food trucks are also wonderful!!!  You can bring your pup and chill outside our go in their quiet hallway for studying. I have yet to have tier coffee,  but I plan on coming super late at night to do just that.  Oh,  they are open 24 hours.    ***you need to have the dill vodka all the time. I'm addicted.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Listed in Local Coffee: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Another fun cafe/bar hybrid, but what sets BuzzMill apart is their selection of infused liquors that they make in house. Rustic vibe, with seating that encourages socializing and viking tables and fun games. In the winter time they even have little fire pits. An added bonus? Bitchin' food trucks in the outdoor patio area.  10/10 would dine again.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Vibes, good. Dust-punk kinda vibes.  There's really great coffee and infused liquors. Food out back is dope (vegan & meat options y'all). Staff is awesome. They have great games. I always run into people I like there. A+++",1
Coffee Shop 65,Okay so today was the first time visiting the Buzz Mill....and the last time...  My needs are simple coffee and maybe a breakfast taco or something of that nature. My friend and I went in there after our workout looking forward to trying something new on Riverside. There was one person at the counter three people behind the counter. No one said good morning and the one question we had which was so have anything else besides danishes was answered by a annoyed looking person wearing a Buzz Mill T-shirt. I'm a pretty easy-going guy am pretty friendly and very nice to restaurant folk and my experience here was terrible.  It's right to bed because the place looks cool I like the idea of something like that in Riverside but the attitude of the staff and the lack of food options made this a miss.,0
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins Listed in Crafty Cocktails!!, Best part of waking up How have I lived in Austin for so long and not been here?! (I've since been back two more times in 7 days).  House-made infused liquors ftw: Grapefruit gin. Pecan bourbon. Cucumber rose gin. Vanilla orange vodka. and more.  They don't have a cocktail menu. You drink that shit with soda and you like it.  As if it couldn't get better than that: They serve beer. Good beer. It's open 24/7. There is a giant grizzly inside. There is lots of wood. It's kinda grungy, but it works. Big patio. Dog-friendly. Live music at times. Mini skee ball games. A BBQ trailer. Some kind of all-you-can-eat pancake thing on the weekends.  Oh, ya, it's called Buzz Mill, I hear they also serve coffee here.  I want to move in.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"I mostly like the fact that this place is always open and it's across the street from my apartment. The coffee is a little bitter for me, but with much doctoring, I can adjust it to my liking. The homemade teas, however, are great, and I will suaully opt for the tea :) I have yet to experience the BBQ out back, but it is definitely on my short list of things to do.  I must mention though, if you want to come here to do work, and think that you can do so in their ""quiet area"" reserved for non-talkers.... you are sorrily mistaken. Unfortunately, people do not know how to  read signs, so more often than not there will be some chatty Kathys back here.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"10 check-ins Favorite coffee bar in austin. I would never have found this gem had it not been for WAKA dodgeball. What an awesome place. Like uncle toms cabin with a full bar. And the uber friendly staff is at its core. Very cool people. Only had one bad experience but that was due to a patron. He was playing skeeball and i asked a question, turns out Dave Navarro does have a FUGLY white twin. Other than that, ask for a columbian neck tie, or a BuzzMill (black maker, chilled with a splash of soda water).  Then venture out to the patio and sit by the fire on cold nights, listen to live music from the stage, or order a heaping plate of BBQ from the Blue Ox truck.  This place is bound to be a good time. Checking in here also gets you $1 of a coffee. New ox",1
Coffee Shop 65,Great place to go for brunch with pups. The burger is greasy but delicious. Elk has a mexican food flavor and great! Mimosas are a bonus!!!,1
Coffee Shop 65,"This is a unique 24 hour coffee / adult drinks bar.  The evening seems populated by couples and the live music has to stop at 10 pm. due to the local noise ordinance.  However, the coffee and custom vodka's are excellent.  A great hangout and morning stop.",1
Coffee Shop 65,Love this place. Super chill atmosphere. They always have a good selection of beer on tap.,1
Coffee Shop 65,"4 check-ins Not gonna lie, I honestly thought I was going to be murdered by a man wearing bear skins and toting an axe in his overalls when I first stumbled upon this place at midnight. It's not in the greatest part of town and the outside display isn't exactly screaming rainbows and puppies (pretty sure it's an angry bear or something). Stepping in, I was clearly wrong. It's a pretty chill place. It's good for a casual night out with the lads and even better (in my opinion) for a late night of studying if you get sick of campus and/or your apartment.  Things they done right:  1) 24 HOUR COFFEESHOP?! Wish I had discovered this way sooner in my college career so I could have studied in cooler places. Cuz honestly, as a senior now, what the hell is studying? 2) Booth area. Very quaint and cute. Basically begging for me to sit there all night to ""study"". Also, they have outlets at every single booth thing. Gotta be able to juice up, y'all. Very crucial to any study session. That and electricity for your power guzzling laptop. Read that again slowly. 3) BONFIRE FIRE PIT THING OUTSIDE. Y'all. Fire is cool. 4) Pretty decent selection of beers on tap like the 512 PECAN PORTER. Guys, I love this beer. 5) Apparently, there's a BBQ trailer in the back where the fire pit is. Guyyyyyys.  Things they done less right:  1) Booth-cubby-things are made for two people and are reallllllly tight. I imagine it's more for the free spirited student types who sit there with their notepad, pencil, a plate of BBQ, a shot of espresso, and a beer to chase. Not super conducive to an engineering student's needs. Or anyone who likes to put their elbows somewhere besides jammed next to their ribs. 2) I think they only have 4 coffees to choose from on the menu. Don't get me wrong, I could ride a 512 Pecan Porter all night every night. But shockingly, alcohol doesn't help you study, nor does it keep you awake, so sometimes, a cup of Joe is needed to do the trick. And honestly, they really only have the bare bones for coffee there. Don't expect some fancy French stuff or whatever. 3) God awful heavy metal screamo stuff they put on every once in a while at the 2 o'clock hour. Then again, if you're stuck with the night shift at a 24-hour joint, play whatever the hell you want, am I right?  Don't worry about how it looks on the outside, y'all. It's what's on the inside that counts. And the inside holds BBQ, beer, and coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Single best find since I've moved here. The atmosphere is great. The music is great. The servers are great.  It's craczy to think that I would be studying at a coffee/bar place, but I am. I love love love this place ,and will be back to study again.  Study: There's inside seating and outside bench sitting. Inside may be a bit loud, but it's warmer now that fall is here. Outside is cool and have plenty of benches to study at. There is a nice fireplace if youre reading. I would recommend bringing headphone. Once i plugged mine in, I am ready to study.I will say that it gets louder later into the night since plenty of people come here to hang out. Wifi is great. I was able to stream class video and listen to spotify without any issue  Music: They have live music everyday except for Wed and Sun. They have live comedian on Wed. Today was my first visit, and I LOVED the live music. I actually took off my earphones to study to live music. Now, this is a true Austin experience.  Drinks: They have many things on tap. Happy Hour is 5-8pm. I ordered the tea, and the server graciously allowed me to refill my hot water a couple of time.  Food: They sell food here. I didn't get any so I dont know much about it beyond that it smelled good.  Cost: For $2.5 I was about to study, listen to live music and enjoy not being in my room. I can take that.  Parking: There's not that much parking, but you can park on the streets. So there.  Only con: the bathroom is tiny and there are plenty of people here who need it from all the alcohol, so it may not be the nicest bathroom I have ever been.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"Went here to see a band I like. The sound system is always great and they have good engineers and good taste in bands, at least the couple of times I've been here. Unfortunately it seems like some of the over-the-top hipster bartenders should keep their dickish opinions about people's drink orders to themselves. Maybe these two tatted and bearded wonders fancied themselves a comedy duo, but the mock-""Tool Time"" routine about my beer being ""what Patrick Swayze would drink in Roadhouse"" was a bit much. It was a coffee porter. Sorry my BF didn't want one of your 27 choices of IPA and opted for one of about 3 other choices available.  I was a bartender for 7 years. I don't care how cool you think you are. Don't be a d-bag when you work for tips.",0
Coffee Shop 65,"4 check-ins Listed in Pup Friendly Places, Life is like a cup of coffee There are lots of coffee shops that also serve decent coffee, bagels and local taps. The Buzz Mill however stands out in several ways. They had 4 people working on a busy Sunday afternoon. All were friendly and working with a purpose. So despite a constant flow of customers there was practically no wait. I liked the lumberjack theme and found the mason jar lights pretty unique. I am not sure what it is like here other days days of the week but it was family friendly when I went. Kids and adults a like were enjoying pancakes from Blue OX and they have a table with modern day link and logs to keep the kids busy. The outside is also dog friendly and apparently tea cup pig friendly. There is a cinder block fire pit with wooden benches for those chilly nights.  I ordered a cold brewed coffee black and it is amongst the best ones I have had. No bitter after taste and served up in a pint glass. They sell kits to make your own cold brewed coffee too. I was also pleased they serve Topo Chico to wash down the BBQ and Bloody Mary I had later. Speaking of the Bloody Mary they run $4 for house vodka and $5 for the habanero infused. Warning, the habanero infused is not for pussies. Admittedly I did half house and half infused. It was pretty spicy and didn't require many ingredients from the bloody Mary bar to make it tasty.  Oh and an extra star for staying open 24/7 and smelling like fresh saw dust...I love that smell. Make your own bloody with habanero infused vodka and a side of Topo Chico",1
Coffee Shop 65,"I moved to Austin from Portland in November 2013 and was happy to find the Buzzmill. One of my first experiences was going there on Thanksgiving. I have no family in the area, but they made me feel like family with the best free Thanksgiving dinner. The theme of the place is logging, which actually happened at one time in Portland, but it's funny to see in Austin. I think the owner of the Buzzmill is from Portland and owns a few places there. The Buzzmill is open 24 hours and does have a happy hour for good cheap microbrew drafts. There is also coffee and hard alcohol, but no food, other than coffee shop type food. There are a couple food carts out back, including a decent BBQ place called the Blue Ox. They have a great backyard area and there are events there: standup comedy shows, bands, and more. People who aren't ""hip"" might call the Buzzmill elitist, but I don't think this is true. The Buzzmill attracts a young hip crowd, but that's because it's a cool place to hang out! So don't be a hater. Just enjoy it. Unless you're a conservative Republican type, but there are a lot of other places you could hang out at.  There's free wifi and a sort of separate room with electrical outlets for all the tables if you need a private place to study or write. It can get crowded and hard to find a spot at certain times though.",1
Coffee Shop 65,"4 check-ins There I was, minding my own business trying to find a cool bar for the WAKA dodgeball crew to hang out at after our ducking, dodging, and diving!! I saw the Buzz Mill in all its glory. I thought, ""Mr. Smidgens needs a coffee!!"".  I found a parking spot in front and strolled on in. There was Mitchell and the coffee/full bar in all their glory!!!! Shut your face!!! No, really!! Coffee, beer, and liquor!!! Woooooooooo!!!!!  Mr. Smidgens felt right at home with his new facial hair. I ordered up a chai and almond milk on ice and breathed in the Buzz Mill. As I looked around I saw that there were a few other of my favorite Yelpers hanging outside in the sunny courtyard.  We caught up on all the skinny and decided to order some BBQ from Chase and his Blue Ox trailer. I decided to go a half pound of lean brisket and a quarter pound of pulled pork. With free pickles and a delightful bbq sauce I was ready to give my taste buds a treat!!  I tried the brisket and it was flavorful but not mind blowing. With the sauce it was quite delicious though. Now the pulled pork did things to my taste buds that would make Keri B blush!! I loved it!! I washed it all down with a Topo Chico mineral water.  After one of the blonde beauties I was hanging with left we took the show inside. This is when I decided to get the vanilla latte that they use their own house made vanilla syrup in! I decided to get an extra shot of espresso, but I was informed they come in two. So, two shots deep I went for two more. It was the most mind blowing vanilla latte I have ever had the pleasure of drinking and enjoying for the rest of the day!! That 3 miles I ran seemed to fly by! Woooooooo!!!  The atmosphere is awesome sauce, the libations are the best around, and the food is nommolicious!!  Come one come all to the Buzz Mill / Blue Ox!! Buzz is open 24/7 and Blue Ox is Open Thursday to Sunday until they run out!!",1
Coffee Shop 65,"2 check-ins Unlike other self-billed ""versatile"" establishments, The Buzz Mill actually is able to pull off its many facets without destroying the experience.  The Buzz Mill is a 24/7 coffee shop/lounge/bar with food trucks. Whoa, really? All of those? Any one of those things could be a successful, self-sustaining business in this town. But Buzz Mill does them all, and does them all well.  The secret to The Buzz Mill's success? Probably its spaciousness. It's not a huge place, but each one of its three sections has the right size and feel. The sections are the outdoors, the indoors, and a long, thin room.  The outdoor section is The Buzz Mill's largest and most social section. It has a two food trucks, a stage with some benches, plenty of tables and seating, and even games to play (big jenga and skeeball--you know that one game you always played to get tickets at Chuckee Cheese's). You won't feel crowded outdoors--even on the weekend nights, which is when they have live music and things get a little hoppin'. The Buzz Mill is not a typical bar scene on the weekend, though--it's a lot more chill; it's a place you would go with your friends to get a drink and chill. It's not a place to dance or to get cray-z.  The indoors is a lot more intimate, and it's a little less social. Some people study inside and some people chat. They have a long bar with a surprising amount of variety. They have a ton of different coffee drinks and a ton of different alcoholic drinks. Their specialty is infused-liquor drinks. They have a ton of interesting combinations that will pique your curiosity.  They also have this long, thin room that seemed a little secluded. I got the impression this was a kind of dedicated study spot. People come with their laptops and books to study here; presumably they're trying to get work done. Even though it has a bustling social scene not more than a few feet away, you wouldn't have a problem feeling comfortable enough to get work done here.  The Buzz Mill is a place for all seasons. Highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Good coffee, pastries, and plenty of seating!  They have a patio out back with more seating, surrounded by an abundance of plant-life for a relaxing environment for studying or work. The bathrooms are nice and large, and even have full-body mirrors! It isn't too loud or crowded on a normal day so no complaints there. There is also a good amount of outlets for your devices.  The espresso here was surprisingly good; I haven't heard or seen much about Once Over so I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised! I also tried a muffin - the carrot bran, and it was very tasty.  Overall a good study spot, especially if you want a place without the distractions of having perfect aesthetics or fancy seating or service. Just a good ol' standard coffee shop with some really good coffee. Cap & carrot bran muffin! How you are greeted at the door LOL",1
Coffee Shop 49,"I swung through here on Saturday as I was in the area and had a GREAT iced mocha.  I know that drink doesn't give me much street cred, but the heart wants what it wants right?  It was really good, one size $5 I wish I had cash for the lil discount.  I will remember if I come back.  It was quiet, people were talking some, a few people were reading.  I usually have my kids, and I would not bring them in here, it's much more of a grown up place - you may be thinking, well duh you asshole, it's a coffee place - but some places are ok to bring a kid to, I would not put this place on this list, but for when I escape from them, I'd come here :-)",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Such a perfect no-frills, get sh*t done kind of place. It was exactly what I was looking for on this particular day after trying to find anywhere to get a coffee on a busy weekend. The crowd was there to work and I was lucky to grab an open table. The interior was dark and this day they had excellent music taste. I easily passed a few hours there without realizing where the time had gone.  There are so many things to appreciate about Once Over that it is just so necessary to for me to list them off to you: CASH discount on top of reasonable prices Wild Gift coffee and Rockstar Bagels at a fair price Dope patio overlooking the creek if that is your scene They let bring in your own food Sassy baristas that tell you to leave if you're just trying to hop on the wifi without making a purchase (makes for a good show)  I highly recommend Once Over for all your coffee needs. I will definitely be back to enjoy this location as soon as I am hankering for some focus.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Listed in Keep Austin Delicious Had a good iced latte here just to pass the time after eating tacos at El Primo and before I was to head to the airport for my flight. They have all sorts of newspapers for you to read or to fill in the crossword/Sudoko/jumble. They play good music (not too loudly), and there's just the standard clicking and clacking of young people on their laptops. Lots of seating as well as booze available. Not much more you could ask for.  Also, 10% off if you pay with cash! In case you've never used a hand dryer before... #bathroomshot #bathroomshot",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Meh. I drink a lot of espresso and the two we had here (post-taco espresso time) both were hyper-bitter-burnt. Hopefully burnt is not the style their going for. I'm sure this is a nice place and we may have just had a grumpy coffee guy (he was grumpy). Interior has a bit sparse, drab, and honestly, kind of depressing vibe.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"Good coffee, and a nice little quiet spot. Had the iced coffee with a shot, and it was perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"As far as coffee shops go, this one did not meet my expectations. Pros: Plenty of seating The patio looked beautiful Cons: The guy who served me didn't seem happy to be there, and I felt uncomfortable ordering The iced coffee wasn't great. I prefer the cold brew method where it's made with a bit of foresight. Whereas they brew it on the spot and put it over ice. My iced latte was just that, coffee over ice with milk poured in. It tasted more like a very mildly coffee flavored chocolate milk without the chocolate. With that said, I have not tried any of the hot coffees which could possibly change my mind. If I find myself there again, I'll update my review. Beautiful patio area overlooking a creek Iced latte Counter (featuring Jackie)",0
Coffee Shop 49,"OOCB stays true to the laid back, ""78704"" vibe that is South Austin. The barista on call was very friendly, and the iced coffee I ordered was great.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"I use to frequent this establishment quite a bit. However ever single time I came here the employees attitudes make me regret my decision.  They seem to judge anything you order that is outside of espresso shots. In addition they tend to be annoyed when you ask them any questions.  I'm typically a decent tipper ($1 per coffee), but their attitude left me not tipping them except for my change (cash gives you a 10% discount). When I did this the guy sarcastically said ""thanks for the tip""...  This establishment is now on my banned list.  The only pros are that their seems to be seating (probably due to their attitude pushing people out) and the cash discount on drinks.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"I didn't try any of their coffee, so this review may be unhelpful, but MY GOD IS THEIR JUICELAND SELECTION TO DIE FOR.

Cool Ambiance -- makes you feel like you could write a whole novel inside. Amazing Customer Service -- everyone was so nice and friendly!",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Listed in Best of Austin Cool coffee shop on South First!  Delicious hot, iced, and frozen coffees!

Coffee Shop 49,"My brother in law took us to this coffee shop on a Saturday afternoon. It was such a perfect place to have a before dinner pick me up and enjoy the lovely weather. The Patio is probably the best part, it is in a high traffic area, but the back patio feels secluded and relaxing. My Husband had the regular black coffee, I had a Chai latte and  my brother in law had a cappuccino. All three drinks were different and delicious!  I really wish they had more snacks, but honestly the coffee was enough to keep me coming back! Plus, the location was a huge win. All the food trucks nearby was a lovely surprise.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Been here a few times now. Hands down, best place to have a cup of Joe and get some work done",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Parking is skimp, but luckily there are some side streets surrounding the coffee bar that you can park for free at.  The staff is really friendly. They seemed to enjoy their job and each other which is always refreshing vs the standard coffee house grind.  I grabbed a iced chai to combat the heat that Texas forgot to get rid of. It was spicy as a good chai should be.  They have some small amount of seating inside of the cafe, a few table options out front but the back deck is where it is at. If you sit with your back to the cafe you can watch the slowly babbling water stream of Bouldin Creek that rolls behind the deck in the wooded area. It was relaxing and comforting.  All in all I was impressed by this little gem hidden away on South 1st. Next time you need your caffeine fixing consider Once Over Coffee Bar.",1
Coffee Shop 49,A friend of mine who used to live in the SoCo area frequented this place regularly and said I had to try it. I am by no means a coffee/tea connoisseur but I thought I would check it out one morning.  I ordered an iced chai tea and oh boy was it delicious! I often see a lot of people there on their laptops studying/working and the back patio is a hidden little gem.  Very quiet and peaceful back there! Stop in and check it out!,1
Coffee Shop 49,"Having become a bit of coffee snob as of late, I was eager to try out some local coffee joints while on a roadtrip. This place fit the bill while in Austin.  A good, lowkey place to grab your morning fix with an awesome back porch. My friend and I each had an iced coffee which was good enough to drink black.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"The service was okay, not as friendly as other coffee shops I've gone to. My friend ordered the iced latte, which I didn't get to try, and I got the iced mocha.  I'm notorious for liking my coffee too sweet (8 bags of sugar into black coffee...) and ALWAYS adding cream and sugar. I thought I'd have to add a little more sugar to the iced mocha, that there'd be some residual bitterness the mocha wouldn't mask, but nope. Flavor was perfect. Perfectly sweet for me.",1
Coffee Shop 49,This coffee shop has excellent coffee and atmosphere! The only thing that was a struggle was parking... Took me forever to find somewhere to park. Besides that though this little coffee shop is worth trying out!,1
Coffee Shop 49,"Great little coffee shop; they have gluten free snack options to go with the coffee, too. They also give a discount if you pay cash.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"This was our first time here, and we came for lunch. It's a convenient location with plenty of outdoor seating. Plus, it's got a taco truck as a neighbor. The ambiance is cool, and the drinks are pretty good too. They also offer alcohol and some snacks, like breads and such. But, we wanted the tacos outside and just got two Iced Chais. They were a little on the sweet side, but should go well with spicy tacos. The guys behind the counter were nice and quick, so no complaints. If you're in the area looking for coffee, this is a great choice, especially on a beautiful day.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Very cozy place with a nice coffee. I like the atmosphere, although they need to add cookies and some more stuff to their menu",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Once Over employees have always been EQUAL OPPORTUNITY JERKS.  Their owner seems to be somewhat swell, but his staff treat all who walk in, save a select few, as if they are intruding ignoramuses.  Their ability to pull a shot lured me for a couple of months, but their intense navel-gazing self-righteous disrespect of people just turns that coffee to mud.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"The coffee is always spot-on and I can usually find a place to sit.  The baristas are friendly even when I bring my little 3 year old nephew in.  Granted, he's a pretty quiet sweet little guy so we're not tearing up the place, but still it's nice.  He likes the bagels.",1
Coffee Shop 49,They give you a discount if you pay cash.  I think that might be the only good thing I have to say about this place.  I guess that isn't a complement but its not a compliant.

Coffee Shop 49,"2 check-ins I stop in here every time I go to el Primo. I'm always greeted with a smile and leave with a warm heart. The baristas are so friendly and they know what they are doing.  This morning I ordered an iced chai latte for $3.50 and I was in and out in less than 3 minutes. My drink was cold and refreshing; everything I needed for this hot Austin morning.  I would come here more often if parking wasn't so tight. There are multiple spaces, but the parking lot is cramped and commonly full. Iced chai latte while I waited for my breakfast tacos from El primo.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Visited this shop per the recommendation of a local, since it's my first visit to Austin. I must have been super tired and the iced blended vanilla latte sounded good, so that's what I had. If you like sweet, you might enjoy this. It was a little too much for me, so I can't say I'd recommend it.  Should have tried one of their ice lattes (my usual) instead.  They do have the smallest dog park around though! Very cute. Store front Punny! Ice blended vanilla latte",0
Coffee Shop 49,"3 check-ins Cute spot with a nice laid back feel. We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in by two lovely baristas. I ordered the cappuccino and my friend the latte, all were nice and strong. Once Over offers a peaceful place to study and a beautiful patio area to chill with your friends. I felt very welcomed here and will return if I'm in the area.  One thing that I found annoying was the parking notice on their door, a certain portion is supposed to be blocked off for the business next door and encouraged street parking. I parked there anyways, the business they are referring to appeared vacant. They should definitely consider marked parking spots so that a nice coffee goer doesn't get towed...not all people read notes. Cappuccino...so good! Latte Pumpkin treats",1
Coffee Shop 49,They made good iced lattes. I always forget that they don't have caramel flavor for the latte. They have good choice of beers :),1
Coffee Shop 49,"I love this place!  The coffee is good. The baristas are friendly, and the atmosphere is excellent.  Once Over Coffee is located in a great spot on S. First. Parking is a little limited, but I always find a spot on neighboring streets.  When you first step inside, the space looks at little small, but don't be fooled, there's an enchanting patio space out back with excellent views.",1

Coffee Shop 49,"Terrible! I ordered the iced chai and I couldn't drink it (that's how bad it was). My boyfriend had the iced mocha, and no no no! I don't know a lot about coffee, but I've tried better ones.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"Delicious coffee and a beautiful outdoor patio in the back overlooking the creek. So tranquil and beautiful. The baristas know the regulars there and it feels like a bar type setting. I was kind of jealous and wanting to be part of the gang! I still need to compare the taste to my favorite coffee, Houndstooth to see if it is a tie, or a happy second, but it wins in regards to the relaxing environment out back. It is also a fun place to people watch and listen to all the conversations if you are there with your laptop. The baristas are nice enough; not as friendly as Houndstooth or some of my other coffee stops, but I totally love the way they know their locals. I think this is one of the best places to go for a date or with a friend on a cool Autumn or Spring day and sit out back. Another plus; plenty of outlets for the laptop.",1
Coffee Shop 49,I visit this place every time I come to Austin. Their chai latte is by far one of the best I have had.,1
Coffee Shop 49,"Our favorite coffee shop in Austin by a long shot. Being Houstonians, we have a few spots in Houston we like better, but this one gets pretty close. Iced lattes are our favorite. Very rich, the espresso they use almost had a chocolatey flavor. I also like that they shake the espresso and milk in a Boston shaker before pouring on ice so that it's all thoroughly mixed and cooled.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"My favorite coffee bar to go to in Austin.  Love to sit out on the back patio, have a nice warm cup of coffee, and work on my laptop or read a good book. Wonderful service and cool music always await you.",1

Coffee Shop 49,"This place is horrible! The whole idea that ""you aren't cool enough, or not a regular"" isn't a reason to treat your customers like shit. This Ill-mannered establishment is just a place for a bunch of stuck up egotistical pricks who's only function is to brew crappy coffee. These precocious tarts are completely devoid of any human qualities and I refuse to even acknowledge this place as a coffee bar. The barista was snarky and impolite the entire time and acted as our presence was such a burden to her existence that she spent eight minuets just sitting down not even acknowledging my partner and I. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"Really good, and cheap coffee. Frozen mocha is tasty, and the iced coffee is refreshing. $1 and some change refills on the iced coffee. Friendly baristas too.  Pay with cash and get 10%.",1

Patio is nice, though. Five stars. My friend C. brought me here.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Listed in Coffee Shops I spend a lot of time in coffee shops--this one is down the street from me and a great spot if I need a quiet space to work from. The music isn't overwhelming and there usually isn't the noisy clatter that makes other coffee shops (hello Summermoon) less desirable if you're actually trying to get work done. Same goes to the people who work there. I interpreted the vibe as respectful, though it could have been because I was a girl on a mission.  Oh, and the coffee's good, too.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"""If you're not a regular, I don't give a shit about you, I'll never see you again.""  Heard that the first and last time I was in Once Over.

Once Over, where the attitude matches the coffee in bitterness and ability to scald.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"I'm going to get shit for this, but I'm a Starbucks person and this place had some ratchet nasty drinks. Staff was really sweet and the venue is cute but the coffee was undrinkable. I ordered an iced latte with vanilla (way too much syrup) and an frozen mocha (flavor was just completely off). Tried to support the local Austin coffee scene and not just go to Starbucks but this place was a miss for me.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"You don't go to Once Over for the service. This is not a feel-good coffee shop where baristas offer meaningless over-the-counter compliments to cover up the fact that you're about to consume black tar water infused with caffeine.  Depending on which camp you're in, you're stepping deep behind enemy lines when you walk inside. There's hipsters almost everywhere - snapping photos on their vintage Hasselblad's and pondering Nietzsche. There's a bizarre blend of post-rock, twee and dub reggae espousing in the background. You'll probably wait a while before getting acknowledged...and you might feel inclined to automatically apologize when they ask you what you want.  This place serves amazing coffee, espresso and cappuccinos 100% on their terms. If you want a crew that actually knows and cares about the craft of brewing or the specific flavor profiles of various coffee beans - look no further. In many ways, Once Over is the counter culture of Austin. It's where quality surpasses experience (you New Yorkers will appreciate this).  Personally, I love this place. I visit here about four days a week because I know what I'm getting every time: damn. good. coffee.  I also love the baristas - they really are quite lovely once you show your face a few times. And if you ever get the chance, chat with the owner Rob. He's taken a stab at coffeepreneurship in California and North Carolina before realizing Austin is the perfect home for Once Over.  Tip: don't look like you work for the man and you'll easily strike a great conversation with one of their baristas or patrons.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Similar to other reviewers, I say DO NOT GO HERE! Again, it is highly rated bc of its coffee, but it's coffee you can get almost anywhere in Austin. I frequent coffee shops for the atmosphere and for the service--this place is lacking in both aspects.  First of all, the place feels like a garage that has been converted into a small study space (i guess this is desirable for hipsters?).  Secondly, (and most importantly) the service is horrendous. The barista was not only incredibly rude and condescending, but he also seemed to be throwing a little baby temper tantrum because he was visibly angry and he was throwing around the mugs from the dishwasher as if he were trying to break every last one of them. That was completely distracting and immensely annoying.  BOTTOM LINE: do yourself a favor and don't waste your hard-earned money nor your valuable time here.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"Immediately upon entering I felt small and apologetic. My demeanor was not hipster enough to be allowed in. Clearly I had entered a top secret cool club where fat strangers were prohibited (must have missed the sign on the door ). At most coffee joints you can order an iced coffee with a few pumps of your choice flavoring . I made the grave mistake of ordering my husband's usual at our local shops: an iced coffee with mocha. The barista condescended back ""you want an iced coffee .....with chocolate, then?"" I apologetically explained it was for my husband. In an effort  to not be shamed again I blurted out the first thing I saw that was chilled and refreshing-iced green tea...(just get me out of here).  We foolishly were in the neighborhood and saw there was outdoor seating (we had our dog with us) and thought we could grab some coffee and sit outside for a while.  Wrong. We would never ever be so bold as to bother that poor barista again with our plebian orders or money.  To top it off the to go cups were microscopic and as we high tailed it out with our 12oz/$6 worth of drinks my husband's ""chocolate coffee"" spilled not only on me but three times more on him. For that price you'd think they could track down functioning lids, in between sulks.  I wish I could retrieve the $2 I obligatorily stuffed in the tip jar.  Don't go unless you're already on a first name basis with the staff.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"I agree with many of the other posters here that this coffee bar is far overrated. It took the barista 5 minutes to so much as acknowledge my existence as he was busily chatting away with a friend of his as I stood a few inches away. When he finally deigned to take my order, he couldn't be bothered to make small talk, instead continuing his conversation with this friend as if I wasn't even there. The cappuccino I ordered was about as good as the service.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. It's just another joint suffering from too much of a cool vibe to provide adequate customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"The best alternative to the junk coffee that is Starbucks. This place is lined with funky photos framed in what look like metal electrical outlet covers, strung by clear fishing lines. And the folks banging away on their laptops who have emigrated over from Starbucks and other cafes, presumably.  I had the iced chai latte, one of the best I've ever had, to be honest. My friend had the espresso and was buzzing (literally) about it for hours. This place is definitely legit if you are a coffee / tea lover or just want a drink in a place with a chill, Austin vibe.",1
Coffee Shop 49,Awesome staff and great coffee. Go local!,1
Coffee Shop 49,"Listed in Austin: Future Visits Guaranteed, Austin: Coffeeshop Adventures There are two types of ""Austin-y:"" the made-up cute (e.g. Vintage Heart Coffee) and the grungy weird (e.g. Bennu). Once Over falls somewhere between the two, probably closer to the grungy side. Good ambiance for chill work time. It's a small place, but there are a good number of small tables that line the wall. My friend and I sat at one of these, right under a, er, lovely painting of a naked lady. Awkward start to the morning? Check.  My thoughts: Chai latte - Very light flavor, almost tasted like drinking hot milk. Glad that it was still pretty creamy tasting and not watery like other crappy chais I've had, also wasn't overloaded with milk foam. Not a fan though--would stick to espresso drinks next time. Cappuccino - Yummy! Would get again. I was able to ask for it with one shot rather than two. Apricot and white chocolate scone - Yum! Pumpkin bread - Moist and flavorful, but I would pick a different pastry next time (maybe the cinnamon roll)",1

Honestly, take a look at their t-shirts on the wall. I picked up the purple one - soft, comfy, deep-plunge V, it doesn't scream the establishment's name and I'll honestly end up wearing it a lot and get the satisfaction that purchases like these really support local business.  I haven't explored their menu fully, but I will have plenty of time to do that. While the South First stretch between Oltorf and Riverside is the breakfast leg of my morning commute, I still have a few more places to visit... but I really think this may be my regular spot on the way to work.  First time I came in here they had $3.00 beer advertised... not as a special. I could be wrong about that - Wrote it in a tip. Regardless, I like the little back patio as it offers a starkly different view and atmosphere from the front - foliage, soft glowy lights. I really look forward to having a casual drink out here one evening.  So I'm a really big fan of this place and I hope they let me come back if I promise not to actually bite the baristas.

Coffee Shop 49,"What would you do?  I was sitting at my favorite coffee spot, Summermoon, when friends called and wanted to get coffee.  Great I say, I was already at a coffee joint.  But they suggested Once Over, so some of us could get beer and others coffee.  Okay!  So I scooted over there (literally a few doors down) with my moon coffee and grabbed us a big table.  Once I was done with my coffee I would get a beer with my friends.  I was the first one there, so I whipped out my laptop and was surfing the web waiting for them.  Well, I was asked twice to leave - all within ten minutes.  The first time someone came to my table and asked me if I wanted something. I said ""No, not right now but I'll be getting something when my friends arrive.""  He looked angry and left.  About three minutes later, another person arrives at my table and says ""Our tables are reserved for paying customers only, and you must buy something or leave.""  I said I was surely going to buy something and I was waiting on a group of friends to arrive before I did.  He then said ""Well, we don't allow outside drinks in here.""  I was so upset.  I've never been treated that way before.  I guess I understand they want to reserve tables for paying customers only but I was about to have six people come and we were all going to buy drinks.  And the place was completely empty.  Well, I did what any other smarted person would do - I turned my ""outside drink"" upside down on the table so it spilled all over - and I left.  My friends and I are now at Stouthaus Coffee Pub as I write this.  I think I did the right thing.  I won't be going back to Once Over ever, again.",0

Coffee Shop 49,"DON'T GO HERE! Please, for your own sake, don't go here. You'll thank me later. People give this place a high rating because the coffee is generally good, and the porch view is pretty, but honestly the awful service just isn't worth it. The barista is rude, standoffish, and just not a nice person. A few examples should demonstrate why this man is an anthropomorphic douche nozzle hipster bag of dicks, and not someone you want to give your money to. My friend, who we'll call Suzy, went here the other day and overheard the man saying rude things about customers after they left, about their physical appearance among other things. Another friend, who we'll call Greg, told me the same story independently about what he heard there. I was here with three friends once, and two of us ordered drinks and sat down. We were only in the place for a few minutes, with my two other friends still sitting and deciding what to order, when the barista approached and told them to ""get out"" since they hadn't ordered. There was no need for seats at the time, the place was mostly empty. And we were certainly causing no disruption, we were talking VERY quietly. It was the rudest thing I have EVER had happen to me at any coffee shop, and while I can't recall what he said verbatim, suffice to say it was sassy and snarky enough to make the cruelest playground bully proud. This is really not a nice or friendly man, and certainly not someone who you would want to give your patronage. Reading other reviews I've heard similar reports about the employee's rudeness, for example he has said he only cares about his regulars, and doesn't care about you if you're passing through. Wow. This man ADMITS he doesn't care about his customers. Makes you really want to go right? Personally I might have become a regular, if not for the dick hipster who works there. I hope I've saved others from going at all. There's a million coffee shops in Austin (so 999,999 better than this one), you can find another to regular. The regulars here are mostly a collection of cliquish contrarian hipsters anyway. There is not a human being on earth that can't do better than this place, don't go here. Save yourself while you still can.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"First time to visit this coffeehouse & I would say the back porch is the best thing about it.  Surrounding the back porch is vegetation that gives a bit of serenity.  And, the porch is large enough to be able to sit with your party & visit without the neighbors in on the conversation.  My Mocha coffee was cool; not hot; not warm; not cold....cool.  bleh  And, as for pricing..... maybe I don't frequent coffeehouses enough, but I thought paying almost $10.00 for a regular coffee cup size & a banana nut muffin was a bit expensive.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"Terrible experience. Staff are extremely self important, loudly talking about themselves with inane stories, creating a very disruptive environment. Was not served for over 5 minutes while the barista talked about weekend  plans with a friend. The space is unimaginative and smells bad ('smells like douche' according to my friend). This could be forgiven if the coffee was decent, but it is horrible. I usually order two cups of coffee, but I couldn't bring myself to order another cup of their toilet water. We got out of there as soon as possible, with no acknowledgement from the staff of course. I highly recommend never going here.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"Once Over is my happy place in coffee shop form. I don't take people here unless they are one of my favorite people. I'd hate to run the risk of running into an aquantaince in such a small space. Selfish? Yes. But I want this place all to myself. And only share it with the oddballs that frequent here.  I didn't always feel this way about Once Over. It's a bit odd at first, but you have to trust their methods. They know what they're doing. They take your order like a bar does. Drink first, then payment. It may be confusing the first time, but the emphasis is on the coffee, the service, and the experience of getting a perfect cup of coffee.  Also, I suggest ordering your coffee ""for here"" instead of ""to go""- it's an entirely different experience.The latte takes on a much deeper flavor in the porcelain cups. Slow down and enjoy the people around you. Talk to the regulars. There's a lot of them. And ask the owners about coffee beans. It's no accident the stuff tastes amazing. They know way more about coffee than you would ever imagine.",1

It wasn't the best I've had but it was certainly decent, for this reason the 4 stars and not 5.  Overall, great for groups of 4 or less. Quiet but not dead, conducive to both working/studying and chatting. Also, 5% discount for using cash is always welcomed.

Nobody else was being served, and there I stood, waiting for the barista to ask what I wanted. I literally watched him stir ice into a jug - obviously a high importance task for the customers who aren't ordering anything. Not once did he say ""I'll be with you in a moment."" Instead, he chose to tell a group if girls (who, by the way, were well paying customers) to go outside because they were taking up too much space.  After my friend came back, we stood for a bit longer before just leaving. This place has terrible service. No comment on the coffee because they didn't even try to get me any.  Don't go here.

Coffee Shop 49,"2 check-ins Listed in Coffee + Wi-Fi near S. 1st Lately, I've been taking my own little tour of coffee shops in the neighborhood, soaking up the free wi-fi, working, snacking, and enjoying a nice cup of coffee, while my daughter is in preschool up the street . Once Over is wonderful. Usually the most critical aspect is the music and Once Over nailed it. I recall one short stint of hip hop, The Replacements, Gillian Welch, and Lloyd Cole. Mmm...just right for my  Goldilocks preferences.  Despite the small size and tiny parking lot, I found parking around the corner and a table, with my very own outlet, in the gauntlet of Macs The outlet is pretty critical for my 2 solid hours of work time and is pretty difficult to find at other shops.  The coffee was decent, though, I wish they had some sort of vanilla or something at the creamer bar to add to it. They do offer simple syrup, for those who like the straight shot of sweetness.  The chocolate croissant is was packed with chocolate. Almost unbelievably so, and it was pretty good.  The service was very friendly and quick.  I'll be back to hope to enjoy the gorgeous patio out back when it warms up.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"I didn't want to write a review for this place for a long time, because, frankly, I didn't want too many people to know about it.  But the cat's been out of the bag for a while now, so I'll do a quick, overdue, well-warranted review:  Best coffee in Austin.  Probably all of Texas.  One of the only places outside of Portland that has reminded me of Stumptown.  That's really all that needs to be said.  Oh, and the prices include tax, and they give a 10% discount if you pay cash, so it comes out to even numbers.  Very cool move, and the way I wish more businesses were run.  Thanks, guys.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Great little coffee shop.  The espresso is good and it has all the essentials: Chill music that isn't loud Local art on the walls The murmur of a diverse crowd WiFi Power outlets An open table Parking* For here cups Environmentally conscientious vibe  * The small parking lot out front was full, however there was plenty of neighborhood parking within a block.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"I think this place makes the best espresso drinks in Austin. Beans are not over roasted and baristas are very helpful. they take their time manually making the drinks, right amount at the right pressure, every time. Result is feast of flavors at each sip Even the brewed coffee is great, very pleasnt texture and flavor.",1
Coffee Shop 49,Stopped in for some cafe. We picked a spot outside in their dog friendly establishment. I drank a latte. I'm not a big coffee drinker but it sure was good. Also liked that it didn't come out scalding hot. Nice place and the staff seemed friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 49,"Very low key coffee house, I liked feeling walking in, very quiet and good for getting some work done. Now, the coffee... It was okay actually there was a strange taste in the coffee not sure how to explain it but not worth getting it again specially when there are so many options... Also the coffee it self was not strong.",0
Coffee Shop 49,Listed in Coffee Shops in Austin Wasn't a fan of the music. Coffee was mediocre. Chairs are wooden. Lighting wasn't the best.  Overall impression: meh.,0
Coffee Shop 49,"I'm very much a ""don't mess with my black coffee or I'll slap you"" kind of person, so it doesn't usually take much to please me, coffee wise.    This place has a great atmosphere, friendly baristas, my black coffee was inexpensive, and I loved the outdoor seating.  Boom.  Thank you for a wonderful experience, Once Over.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Delicious cold brew coffee, gluten-free pastries, and friendly baristas. Great neighborhood coffeehouse.  Very limited parking, so walk or ride your bike over if you can.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Once Over knows how coffee should taste! Their Mocha is a perfect blend of velvety chocolate and coffee; their Latte's are just the right balance of coffee and milk (and flavor if you wish to add it). Silly as it sounds the temperature of the drinks is spot-on, no scalding or having to wait 15minutes til your drink cools down. The service is great...they definitely take the time to get to know their regulars! Ample seating inside, patio outside, decent parking available, wifi, and a nice soundtrack usually playing inside. Can't beat the cash discount and bring-your-own-cup discount either! By far my favourite coffee place in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 49,"Updated review OMFG!  The espresso here is mindblowingly good, best I've had in town!  I wanted an iced latte and was disappointed they don' t have any sugar free syrups.  I'm not one of those supertaster types and I quite oftencan't pick flavors out of things.  I've frequently been out with friends at other places while they exclaim over how good the coffee is and I'm thinking, ""eh, not so great..""  But this latte was super delectable.  It was tasty enough without any flavored syrup.   It is generally a pleasant and quiet atmosphere with friendly service.  Minus one star for not staying open past 9 pm, no sugar free syrups and a very limited food selection.",1
Coffee Shop 49,"One star because I'm addicted to the pumpkin bread (I'd go straight to russell's bakery if it were closer) and the bf likes the coffee. There is a reason this place never pops up on lists next to Medici or Houndstooth Coffee though. It's sub-par and the service is shit. Hide on the patio, or get in and get out (and go to EL PRIMO right out front for the best breakfast tacos ever).",0
Coffee Shop 49,"To the general public- My experience at Once Over this morning was both appalling and disappointing. While waiting for my beverage I heard a barista make (with another patron) anti-gay and homophobic comments. Everyone is entitle to their opinions, but to announce them at work? It was unbelievable, needless to say I will never return to Once Over.",0
Coffee Shop 49,"5 check-ins Once again, I'm late to the party, but I concur entirely with the 100-review 4.5 star average.  (In my defense, it's REALLY hard to cross over to the east side of South First Street. Have you seen the traffic there lately?)  French-press coffee is a big attraction, though making it beforehand defeats the purpose. But a wide range of beers for $3 (not happy-hour prices, but all-the-time prices) and some pretty swell jazz playing on the hi-fi make for fine spot to while away the afternoon hours.  The only complaint I have is that half of the interior smelled like the men's room--a problem I chalk up to, um, the men's room. But the stench was sidestepped with a quick relocation to the lovely patio out back.",1
Coffee Shop 49,A very small sized vanilla latte was $4.50 if you paid with cash but $5.00 if you paid with card. I paid 5.00 for a shitty latte that was not even a warm temp. Blah. It didn't even taste good.,0

Coffee Shop 29,"I was craving smores all day and finally decided to come here with my boyfriend before we began an entire night of studying.  The atmosphere is a great place for a date as it has a very cozy and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The smores were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are paying for the experience. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and snacks. Fast wifi was also a plus here for us.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in ATX The vibe in here is good, but  a place that still sells cigarettes deserves a couple of stars knocked off, but my lower star review isn't just for that reason.  I visited at 7 pm on a Saturday night and we waited at the bar for five minutes while bartenders just ignored us despite not being busy. The seating is comfortable and appreciated, but either people are supposed to bus their own tables but there's no signage around that, or the staff who again, wasn't busy, didn't bother to bus them and everyone instead had to sit down with other people's trash on the tables.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"This is based on experiencing multiple sides of Halcyon, the coffee and the cigar experiences.  The coffee was a decent experience, but still underwhelming when compared to other options close by. I tried both a macchiato and an americano. The macchiato would be more accurately described as a dry cappuccino. I should have known I was in for a lackluster experience when I asked for a ceramic demitasse and was told I would get it in a to go cup. The quality of the espresso extraction was also lacking with an off flavor that makes me think it was pulled a little on the short side and they tried to cover it up with extra foam. The Americano suffered a similar issue as the macchiato with the espresso flavors. It was drinkable, but definitely not something to order again. If I end up here again, I'll definitely avoid espresso based drinks.  The cigar experience was probably the biggest letdown. The humidor was adequate although quite small with a very limited selection but it was a decent selection so nothing wrong there. My complaint comes from their pricing ($13 for an Arturo Fuente Short Story) coupled with their solution for lighting the cigars - paper matchbooks. I'm glad I carry a cigar punch on my keychain because I'm a little worried how the stick would have been cut otherwise. I'm guessing that cigars definitely aren't a big part of their business, but at least having 1 proper butane lighter available should be a necessity for anyone trying to sell cigars so that matches can be avoided. If I'm expected to bring my own lighter, I might as well just bring my own cigar as well.  In general I definitely wasn't impressed by any part of my visit. I may give them another try at some point in the future, but it definitely won't include another trip to the humidor.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Heard good things about Halcyon, so I was glad I was able to stop in for some coffee one morning last week. The Thai iced coffee caught my eye so I ordered it. It was delicious! Very rich flavor and extremely satisfying, especially on a scorching hot day. I only wish Halcyon were closer to me so that I could have the Thai iced coffee whenever I want. The coffee shop also has an interesting, and very comfortable, atmosphere.  Taste | 5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4.5",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 4 check-ins So, I popped out of the relationship I was in when I first wrote my review. And since that delegation have been back to Halcyon numerous times.  Pleased to report that my love of this place was not tainted by the rose colored glasses of my former relationship.  Yes, seating here is going to suck. It's hit or miss when you come in. But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.  Love this place. The employees are awesome, the bathrooms are clean, and just remember....be aggressive when you see a seat free up!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Consistently disappointing. I'm speaking about the service, not the food or the quality of coffee (though both are rather mediocre). I can think of very few instances where a barista or bartender or server has been outright cruel to my face. Sadly, the tall dark-haired male behind the bar tonight was really truly... a jerk.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Nice bright, modern bar and cafe located in downtown Austin.  I came for breakfast and ordered the Overnight French Toast with a Cappuccino. I was a bit confused that despite being ""eat in"" my cappuccino was made as to-go. But it was alright. The french toast isn't your traditional french toast, it's actually pretty dense...more like a bread pudding construction. But it was still very good, I actually enjoyed the more dense, cakey texture.  All in all, it was a good breakfast. There's no rush on the tables and the atmosphere is just fun and lively! French toast Panoramic",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The food here was delicious. They have a beautiful selection and the location is open and comfortable. I arrived for breakfast and got a cream cheese bagel with salmon! Yum! The coffee was A-OK and... Jeez... What a beautiful selection of drinks and food. Such variety! This is a great place to come during your morning work routine, or for a date, or for a reunion with an old friend! Yay!  Why didn't I give it five stars!? They were filming a movie! And, no, it wasn't cool. It was bothersome and it seemed to make the service... Less attentive. I know this may seem like a grumpy review, like, darn you kids and your fancy Polaroid cameras!!! But it really was annoying. The cashier wasn't the most polite guy. I didn't know you were supposed to order up front first (you order up front first!). And he kinda treated me like I was an idiot. It was not welcoming... It was more like, ""oh you DON'T come here all the time?! Well allow me to make you feel like a lesser person."" Yuck. If I wanted judgment I'd go to Burger King and order a pizza. Filming a movie! Set in a restaurant?! I bet it's thrilling!!! (Sarcasm) Yum!!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins Halcyon is like that sweet spot coffee joint, you know?  Like you have to go when you're in the area even if you don't want coffee at the time.  And if you don't want coffee you can have adult beverages, (there's a nice long bar), buy cigarettes ( I don't smoke but they have a huge wall of packs) buy cigars, (they have a humidor room!!!)and even delicious desserts. Like the smores- which is a must, they give you a little gas flame thing and you can melt your own marshmallows. Great Austin-y joint if you want to take your out of town friends...great place to chat and even to work. inside and outside seating. Parking is...well, whatever you can find! Vanilla latte Humidor room.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Ordered a $4 egg panini and a $2.50 cup of coffee. When I checked my credit card statement, they had charged me $9.74. No idea what happened there.  Brusque service at the counter. Not many food options.  Coffee was good. Egg panini was ok, but needed more sauce of some kind on it. Interior space was very Austinish with a variety of places to sit.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Weird service and one of the guys had really off social queues for customer service. When you approach a counter you expect the person serving to ask how they can help, or what they can get for you, or how it's going, etc - But he just kinda stared at me waiting for me to say something. Seems like a lot of kids come to hang out here. The s'mores seem like a cool deal but in the end you get basically two s'mores sandwiches if you're sharing and it's nothing special, the novelty of making your own s'mores in a coffee shop wears off quickly. They forgot two of our drinks because one of their bartenders basically just walked away so I had to ask for it. Didn't really eat anything else, but I'm sure they have other cool stuff to eat. I'm okay with modern coffee shops and it seemed pretty Austin-y but this place just didn't vibe with me that well.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"I have tried Halcyon a few times and have consistently had a good experience. The s'mores (what they are known for) are fun but a little overpriced for what you get. During my most recent stop here, the graham crackers were slightly stale. I also wish the marshmallows were a little bigger!  Now for the good. This place has an incredibly mellow/relaxing vibe. It is great for people watching or just stopping in for a drink/coffee. I have not tried their alcoholic drinks, but their coffee is delicious! The customer service here is solid, and it usually isn't too crowded to find seating.",1
Coffee Shop 29,I loved how friendly the staff were here! And it's awesome for people watching and chilling out. The prosciutto Flatbread was delicious! Funky wall at art at Halcyon,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Came for some Sunday s'mores and coffee. I got the Guatemala pour over which was strong, and delicious. Nice seating areas. There were lots of younger couples/students here. Not a problem, just an observation. The s'mores were a fun experience. Definitely worth bringing a friend here if they are visiting to have a cup of coffee and a catch up chat before going about your day. 4 stars though because other chocolate options would have been appreciated. I know Hershey's are original, but the choice would have been nice.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Pretty neat spot for late night coffee/beer/dessert downtown. I came on a Monday night and they were still hopping in the late night at around 11pm. It was world music night and about 10 different people came to jam out on an array of different instruments, playing music from India, the Middle East, Spain, etc. Everyone together. They were great and people in the audience started dancing. Totally unexpected and totally an element of why Austin is so amazing to create spaces for this to happen and in such unexpected places.  Had a great time. Nice folks at the bar.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"This spot is literally perfection - smack dab in otherwise dirty downtown. A modern interior with tons of intimate couch seating, or traditional bar type seating if you prefer. This place is the perfect pitstop. We arrived here on Friday night and ordered drinks and 'smores. I love the coffee meets dessert meets drinks aspect here, it's refreshing compared to the rest of the dirty 6.  The only thing that's a bit gross is the fact that their restaurant is open to the public and we saw the most random people walk in and use their bathroom which kinda marred the vibe a bit.  Otherwise, I love everything about this place - I'm sure it makes for the perfect daytime brunch and coffee spot as well! A must-visit if you're in Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"What a cute place!  I heard so many good things about their s'mores, and I was in such a s'mores kick so I had to try it out.  I can't say it worked perfectly, and made my marshmallows nice and crisp and gooey on the inside, but It tasted fine!    Their coffee is also very delicious.  I love Austin coffee anyways.  Their beans are so aromatically wonderful.  Great place to go to with a group, or even alone!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Great place - definitely hand pour coffee - if you don't like black you must try this one black no sugar no creamer etc. was a fun chic place to hang out at.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"A friend recommended that I try Halcyon while I was in Austin and I'm so glad I did! My barista was actually from the same town I am, which was absolutely insane to me because it's over 500 miles away! This coffee shop is in a great location and not too far from anything! I ordered an iced latte and my husband got a chocolate frappe and both were excellent! Halcyon has a full bar, so you can add a shot to any drink you purchase. The ambience is awesome, and there is a ton of comfy seating. Their art is mostly from local artists and right now they have huge glitter paintings of celebrities and I almost emptied out my savings account for one of them, but you can't exactly fit a 40x50 canvas in a carry-on bag.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List This is my go to when I am late night raving on 4th.  It can be a bit packed, the baristas a bit pretentious, and the wait time a bit too long...but you are in downtown ATX, kiddo and you gotta learn that this is the norm somewhere so it might as well be where they have ""DIY s'mores"" and killer Thai Iced Tea (w/a shot of espresso, it is DIVINE!) and is one of the better ""after all the bars close"" people watching perches!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"A date night place if I've ever seen one before. It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.  Well, that minor detail aside, I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire.",1
Coffee Shop 29,Very nice a clean setup. Food was very good for a light breakfast. The French toast was just as good as mother made. Great morning breakfast in Texas.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been coming to Halcyon for years, every trip I take to Austin. I've always been a fan of the cute and cozy furniture, the fact that they have alcohol, food AND coffee, and that the atmosphere was chill.  But this last visit was all kinds of disappointing. I would love to blame it on the fact that I was extremely hungover, but I was the only one that was and everyone else was pretty bummed out by the time we left.  We walked in as a group of 6 girls. We ordered individually, food and drinks. It took 20 minutes for the first girl's food to come out. It was just a sandwich. Then another 20 for the next plate. By that time the first girl had finished eating. 10 minutes later, two other plates came out. Followed by two more, another 10 minutes later. It was a ridiculous amount of time for extremely easy food to prepare.  On top of that, the food was inconsistent. My side salad didn't have a dressing, but two other girls' did. Two people ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, but they looked different. One was missing what looked like a sundried tomatoe type of sauce. The food tasted mediocre, at best. At least it was something in our stomachs. But the most laughable thing was the egg panini with sausage. I posted a picture. Literally one sausage patty cut in half, for the entire sandwich. We were so done with the whole experience that we just laughed it off.  There are so many other local coffee shops in Austin that likely won't be returning to Halcyon for a while.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is a really nice place if you're looking for an edgier place to chill with some friends on a late night for coffee or dessert.  It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit pricey here, but I do like the environment here, and the fact that it's open quite late.  The chocolate cake is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of snacks. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For people just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get dessert, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go. But if you're already downtown, or live in Austin, definitely check it out.",1

What really makes Halcyon great though is their wonderful staff. Just a great bunch of people that are super friendly and make everyone feel welcome. Caffeine junkies should ask for the Quad Latte. Also, the breakfast tacos are fantastic. Excellent place to day drink as well for those so inclined.  Great place for tourists to get their bearings on a visit since you're in the warehouse district and close to Congress and Sixth. My personal favorite of the many downtown coffee shops.",1

Based on those experiences, service and the price of our cocktails was quite reasonable. Absurdly reasonable.  Nepotism aside, I really enjoy the environment at Halcyon and the enormous selection of drinks they offer. It's hard to beat sitting outside on a pleasant fall day and people watching. I've never gotten the S'Mores before, but it definitely looks like quite a fun thing to do and would be perfect for a date.",1

Although the espresso martini was tempting me.  The soy latte was very nice. My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For lunch, I had the walnut apple salad. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with bacon, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for lunch. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"". I need to come back and try one of these espresso drinks. A soy vanilla latte The apple walnut salad - very yummy! See all photos from Suann G. for Halcyon",1
Coffee Shop 29,"This place was good, but not great. The positive was the location, they had a lot of seating and the outdoor seating is great for watching people and traffic. I ordered the turkey Brie sandwhich. The salad was good, the greens were very fresh. The sandwich was good...but not great. I am a huge Brie fan and I couldn't even taste it. But for a lunch sandwich, it was good. Make sure you have time to wait though, it was about 20 minutes!!!! The place was extremely busy starting around noon. We didn't try the coffee, we went around the corner to caffe Medici!!",1

Coffee Shop 29,"PERFECT DATE PLACE!  This is my go-to place for a date and I definitely recommend. We always order the s'mores and it is so much fun. They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows, hershey bars, and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The atmosphere is super chill. I've been when they've had a live musician. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and tables and tallboys. It's across from all the gay bars and next door to Cedar Street Courtyard which are both fun spots to check out after you enjoy your s'mores.",1
Coffee Shop 29,Not sure why I made such a big mistake by not ordering the s'mores but I think I need to come back and try it.  Came here to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was decently packed but nothing to crazy.  I ordered the Iced Latte and sat down for a couple hours to do some work.  The wifi was nothing to crazy but it did the job.  The overall environment in Halcyon was really nice.  Not too loud but not library silent.  I would highly recommend this place for a ice quite place to work or talk to some friends.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"19 check-ins Ahhh Halcyon. This place is a classic and is definitely a place I'd recommend you checking out, especially if you're visiting Austin. Whether it's during the day or at night post-club/post-bar, this place never disappoints.  The s'mores and drinks are amazing here. I highly recommend you try the espresso martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available. Of course if you come at night, especially during the weekend, it may be a tad difficult to find seating. Fortunately, there's also seating outdoors. S'mores and espresso martinis.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The wife and I stopped in late night after dinner. I needed a little caffeine before the drive back to our hotel. We stumbled upon Halcyon and it had a great vibe going on. We lucked out and got a little corner area to sit and take in all the action as we had a view of the whole place. Now this review is mainly for the cold brew coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores dessert that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few tables. I'm sure that they have some other food options, but we really didn't take a look at the menu other than for coffees and teas. We would definitely return and hang out at Halcyon whenever we find ourselves in downtown Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"We got breakfast here to kick off a day in Austin - it was pretty great. Good selection of all the coffee beverages you'd want. Iced coffee was a good - not too bitter, just the way I like it. We also got the Migas breakfast tacos with avocado cream. They were really good, but beware the red salsa - it is extremely spicy. Also enjoyed the overnight French toast. Service was friendly and the place was very quiet and peaceful on a Sunday morning.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange lighting, live music (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous people on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very cozy and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your table? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My cappuccino came in a giant cozy mug. My friend's latte came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The baristas were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate atmosphere for whoever you choose to come with. Open late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an americano and peppermint latte in the background",1
Coffee Shop 29,I had the cosmonaut and it was pretty darn good! The vibe is chill and their music playlist was bomb(in a good way). We also ordered the s'mores and it was really fun and tasty too! Too bad we aren't from Austin because Id probably be here all the time if we lived here! Smores!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"Cool place that has Austin written all over it.  Good food, polite service, and excellent coffee.   They even offer their own brand of coffee for sale.   Would certainly recommend this place to a friend.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"What are you in the mood for? Coffee?, wine? Mimosa? Or a cigar? This place seems to have it all...what they don't have is table service, so be prepared to order at the register! Food menu is limited. Bar at halycon.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"OVERALL: great place for a quick bite for dessert on a date!  AMBIENCE: perfect little place to go for a date with mild lighting and couches for you to sit. These couches have very comfortable pillows to make you feel like you're in your own home. There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live music playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.  TASTE: we had the smores for 2 people which was about $7. It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but pay at the counter and they bring it to you. They don't really check up on you until you are on your way out. Staff is nice though! Basic smores for 2 with moist towelettes for the mess! Date night with the private corner of pillows! Super comfy, I thought I could fall asleep there.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Really needed some coffee around midnight since we flew in on a Friday and were tired from the traveling.  We were really surprised how there was a cafe right in the middle of downtown where the party was happening!  Got an iced latte and it was good.  Very nice espresso with whole milk.  Tried a bit of the soy chai latte and typically I'm not a huge chai fan, but it was some tasty brew!  Didn't try the food, but plenty of people had drinks from the bar also on a Friday night.  The atmosphere is definitely on the cool side.  Outdoor area is great for people watching.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"After a stroll on town lake with a friend in from California, we wanted to grab a cup of coffee and be able to chill out to people watch. I had my dog Nymeria with me as well so I suggest Halcyon because of the seating outside and I've heard people rave about this place. This was a chill day after New years winter day in Austin so the weather was perfect. We parked nearby and my friend waited outside with the dog so I went in to order. The line was about 5 people deep and the inside place was pretty full. One thing that I thought Halcyon did well is the different flavors of hot chocolate. I ordered their special of the day which was Mocha La'orange (mocha with an orange zest) and my friend got their Mayan hot chocolate (spices and cinnamon). I asked about how long the drinks would be so I know about what time to come back inside to grab them, the barista said 5-7 minutes. Usually I wouldn't care but we also had a parking meter ticking for 30 minutes. I came back outside and I loved where we sat because there was heat lamps above to keep us warm. I did notice however where we were were the only place with heat lamps, no where else on the patio. After about 7-10 minutes I went inside and was hoping my drinks would be on the counter. No one acknowledged me and I looked around to see if the people that were ahead of me got their drinks already, not yet either. About 2-3 more mintes pass by and the couple that was infront of me in line finally got their drinks called so I figured ours would be up soon. Turns out I end up waiting another 10 minutes for our drinks. End of the story, took us 20+ minutes to get the coffee drinks, not much people watching was done on my part because I spent all that time inside, my dog got lots of praises for being cute, and we were just a few minutes late back to the truck after the meter ran out.  Dont get me wrong, our drinks were pretty good, but I would not come back here again when there are so many much better service at other coffee shops in town that also serve a good cup of joe.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is a perfect stop for an afternoon coffee or late-night drinks with friends. The vibes, staff and patrons are friendly - a refreshing change of pace from those other manic, packed downtown ATX venues. Grab a local beer with some friends and enjoy this unique venue. True, authentic Austin charm.",1

Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in The Attraction of Austin When I checked in here, Yelp asked me, ""Is this place Hipster?""  The answer is DOUBLE YES.  I almost caught myself on fire walking past the mini-grills, as everyone made s'mores on their tables.  Regardless of your feelings toward the Hipster...movement...Halcyon is a fun place.  They have eight different kinds of hot Toddy's!  Eight!  The Buttery Rum is absolutely delicious.  A friend ordered coffee with Bailey's and was happy as a clam.  Their signs were funny - ""Are you hungry? We'll get you drunk. Are you thirsty? We'll get you drunk. Are you lonely? We'll get you drunk.""  The drinks took quite a while to make, so come by if you've time to chill out and aren't rushing somewhere. ""Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, all the vices in one place.""",1

I like working on my laptop here but fundamentally believe I shouldn't be forced to buy TWC Wifi because Halycons connection is so bad. Reconsidering my default work spot.  Update: Internet connection seems to be much better! Owner also contacted me on Yelp to apologize. Yay!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Coffee was fine. But I waited 45 minutes for my flatbread order even though it wasn't really busy. After 30 minutes of waiting I asked them if it was almost ready and apparently they totally missed my order.,0
Coffee Shop 29,"We love this place. It's all kinds of coffee, liquor, and food goodness wrapped up in the best vibe ever.  The service is warm and friendly. You are in the South, you know.  The atmosphere is chic and casual. Noise levels are completely perfect for intimate conversation and they have outdoor seating.  We visited multiple times on our last visit to Austin and mostly did coffee and breakfast. Both very tasty. We did come for a cocktail in the late afternoon and the bartender made a concoction that was delectable. The Bees Knees, I believe.  This is a place I recommend frequently to friends visiting Austin. You should go.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Disappointed that they ran out of french toast when we went, but their panini was very delicious - a must have! Egg panini w sausage and cheese - amazing",1
Coffee Shop 29,Came in for coffee on our way out of Austin.  We all decided to get Vietnamese coffees.  They were so delicious! Even the non coffee-lover we had with us enjoyed it.  Perfect on temperature and sweetness. Vietnamese Coffee,1
Coffee Shop 29,The coffee was great the atmosphere was comfortable. A great spot to be if you want to be downtown and not in a bar or club.,1
Coffee Shop 29,"This place is a cool hang out. The decor in this place is awesome, with great lion artwork on each wall. They have a pretty extensive liquor selection, and they have a pretty wide variety of beers. The only thing not great about this place is they do not have a tap for beers or cold brew coffee. If this place had that I would give it 5 stars. Still a cool place though. All the art in the shop is lion themed Beer and liquor selection",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Cool vibe, great art on the walls and music. There is a full bar, coffee and snacks. Plenty of room to chill and get some work done.  If you think of what has happened to Cecil the lion, then all the pictures of Lions will get another meaning. Like a reminder for us people, that we owe to the Animal kingdom.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"7 check-ins MUST TRY!! Absolutely adore the iced mocha. The iced vanilla latte was also good compared to other places I have tried. For both iced drinks it was $10.28 so it was a bit pricey, but I don't think that will deter me (my poor wallet lol). I didn't really investigate for stamp cards, but I will next time.  The inside was very cozy and had great Austin flare. A good amount of seating ranging from couches, to tables to little pillow bed-ish couches in the corners. I think it's a great place to study or come from brunch. They do have a food menu but the times which breakfast and such are served is limited. I came in for a waffle that I saw on yelp but I came in too late. Coffee barely lasted until the end of the review",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins Fun atmosphere and vibe. I ordered a coconut mocha drink that was too sweet until it watered down a bit. A friend ordered a coffee that was just slightly above room temp, while another friend ordered hot tea that felt like it was heated on the surface of the sun. There was little to supplement the hang out experience. Their wifi was abysmal even though the place was relatively empty at the time (I have seen it much more congested). The board games had missing pieces and the restroom door did not lock properly nor was it very clean. Considering the hype for this place, the experience fell short.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"bleh.  A cool concept, cramming a lot of different things (coffee shop, bar, restaurant, patio, etc.) into a very small space. What I've tried (mostly coffee) has been pretty good but the low rating is due to the smoke. You can't get through or even around the place while trying to walk by without breathing in smoke, it's horrible. The ""15 foot"" law is completely and utterly ignored.",0
Coffee Shop 29,"I love going here on a random night out. They have a great selection of coffee and tea! Warning: their drinks are extra hot (as they should be). Not lukewarm like some places. They even have s'mores. I mean, need I say more? It's a great place to take your friends from out of town or a coffee date. My favorite is the earl grey tea there. S'mores!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Listed in Favorite Coffee Shops This place was so neat! I've heard so many things about this ""smores bar"" place and it didn't disappoint! We had a party if 4 and order the big platter of smores and 2 glasses of wine! The wait staff was super friendly! We were from out of town and they recommend a few other places to try!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Friendly service, fun atmosphere and free music. Everything an evening spot should have. They also have outdoor seating and a walk-in humidor! Awesome Ginger toddy. Delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"The two things I ordered at Halcyon both involved chocolate.  1) S'mores This is an ingenious idea that I wish more coffee shops did. It was freezing (for Austin) standards and I had a lot of fun torching marshmallows (and watching my girlfriend light a few on fire) before squashing them in between some Graham crackers and chocolate. Love it.  2) Some sort of chocolate martini thing. I don't really know what it was because I was drunk, but it sure was yummy when I had it! You should be able to figure it out when you get there.  Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seats for its location downtown. You seat yourself, and I think most people have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having. There aren't many electrical outlets handy, so that certainly helps keep the stereotypical buy-one-coffee-and-stay-all-day-on-your-laptop customers away.  I highly recommend it as a good meet up spot and date location! The bar",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been coming here for years, like 7 years. I did come a lot to day drink because the bar opens at 7am! Well today I'm here for coffee and avocado smash toast, which is toast with avocado and salmon. There's only 3 people in this entire establishment and this toast is taking over 32 minutes. Man this place sucks",0
Coffee Shop 29,"It was super crowded however, I loved the atmosphere. Amazing coffee. S'mores were amazing! I will go back during day time hours. 9:00 on a Friday evening is a little intense.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"2 check-ins This place rocks!  I'm from Chicago with a Starbucks on every corner. I love visiting independently owned coffee houses. But most don't have such an awesome food menu. On a short trip to get out of the cold weather, I stopped here twice. Customer service is beyond expectational!  Both times, I asked if menu items could be tweaked or combined to reflect my low-carb way of eating. Not only did they help me figure out the best meal, the food was awesome and beyond what I anticipated!  And most importantly they didn't act like I was putting them out. It has a great porch, clean restrooms and the ambience is really nice!  The coffee is delicious too! Specially made salad.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Very cozy, eclectic coffee shop with a hip vibe.  Located right on the corner, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.    Had the Nutella/Banana Belgian Waffles, Egg/Bacon/Cheddar panini, and slow pour coffee.  The food is fresh and very well prepared, but most importantly, it was delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 29,Great coffee and breakfast spot! On the more quiet side of town. Egg panini was fantastic!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"This is a great breakfast place! I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a breakfast sandwich comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy breakfast at this low key joint. The sandwich itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of caffeine, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the barista actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local artists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have cozy places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The baristas are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the wifi is free! As a business traveler, it was nice to get on quickly without having to login or see any ads. This was definitely a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place to travelers, and I hope it's a hit with the locals too! Lox bagel and Thai iced coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Popped into Halcyon 10:30pm on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed but we managed to find a nice seat. The employee taking our order wasn't pleasant and had a very fast paced attitude. We went with the s'mores for two, a mudslide, and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!  They had this dreamboat guy singing indie music, he had such a wonderful voice, we clapped with all our hearts after each tune and we received death stares from people reading their books...sheesh!  FUN FUN times at Halcyon! S'more fun!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Three of my favorite things in life: coffee, cocktails, and dessert. Great location too. Visited a few times so far, first time had lunch, other times had drinks, coffee, and s'mores on the last date. Only comes with one or two servings so would have been down for a double order. Because of the night time buzz people seem very social even in the day time for a cafe when you want to just be working with wifi. Not the silent-whisper to your friend kind of cafe. Good times.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Good place for coffee. Espresso was a bit watered down, though their La Marzocco machine is nice and I suspect it was just a poorly dialed in shot (but they obliged to give me a pull of a single origin). Iced toddy brew and cappuccino were solid. Good seating inside and out.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Updated review 2 check-ins Went here one night with my little sis to catch up since I moved to Houston, and what a great place to do so! We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores snack/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The cashier up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The atmosphere is really chill. A nice cafe to go to when you don't wanna be dealing with 6th street drunkards. I do gotta say though claim your seats swiftly and quickly! Dem seats are in demand.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"A very relaxing cool atmosphere. My bestfriend who visits Austin often comes here during the day to get coffee and do her art. She loves this place and told us to come by!  I ordered what my friend usually gets which is a hazelnut frappaccino. It was so delicious not too sweet and had so much flavor! It is a bit on the really creamy side especially when you're down to the bottom of the frap it gets really foamy but eh, I don't mind that!  I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone seems to be to themselves but very friendly. A great place to study not too loud and pretty relaxing music. It's way better than Starbucks and if you're visiting in town like me I would definitely suggest this coffee place as a must stop by!",1
Coffee Shop 29,If you only have time for one bar or coffee shop in Austin.... Go here. Best mojito I've had in Austin. Also the amazing coffee goes great with the smores!,1
Coffee Shop 29,"I love chocolate. I also love ice cream. And tea. And hot chocolate. Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet caramel. I really love caramel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about. The seating is sectioned off, there's pillows everywhere...",1
Coffee Shop 29,"I've been here multiple times, and I normally would give it five stars, except that parking is always insane, because this is on the corner of such a busy area!  Their food is great, and the drinks to me are just okay. What makes this place so cool is the atmosphere and the type of people that frequent here. You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of people all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea latte.  So, I always give special props and good reviews to those that have great service! The menu",1

Coffee Shop 29,"6 check-ins Used to come here frequently in the summer to read and hang out while waiting for my bf to get off of work downtown. Definitely a cool place to chill if you can find the space. Seating is pretty limited and the place is normally filled with other people working. (which is probably a good sign otherwise) Always a lot of cool art on the walls. I normally would order the hazelnut frappe but have tried the different iced teas, thai iced tea and have gotten a salmon salad that was one of their specials and have tried other things off their menu. Food is always pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try drinks from the bar but in terms of my other drinks I've had slightly sloppy drinks made here and really really good ones depending on the barista. Tipping definitely will go a long way here..",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Halcyon is the perfect spot for so many things: Great coffee, great food, great live music and GREAT breakfast tacos!!  Every Friday I pick up breakfast tacos for my office as an end-of-week treat and when I found out Halcyon was starting to serve breakfast tacos, I had to try them for myself. DELICIOUS! My office had a taste test with various vendors in downtown and Halcyon won, hands down.  As an added bonus, everyone at Halcyon is friendly and goes out of their way to make sure I'm happy. Mari and Jules are especially great and always greet me with a smile, making me feel like I'm entering into a friend's kitchen.  If I could give more than five stars, I would!",1
Coffee Shop 29,"Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I've hated on Halcyon for a while. It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go downtown, but couldn't actually go downtown (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au lait's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon.",1
Coffee Shop 29,"We were looking forward to a good happy hour vibe. However, drinks were mediocre and our bartender was grouchy, repeatedly yawning and laying her head on the bar, complaining about everything from the music to being at work. We probably won't return.",0

Coffee Shop 72,"I don't know where to begin in describing this place.  All I know is that I want something similar in LA. The closest spots I can think of right now are The Alcove in Los Feliz for the outside seating and Marie Et Cie in Valley Village for having the unique set-up of selling something else on top of the food and drinks.  Austin has a big passion for outdoor seating, this place takes the cake on having the biggest outdoor area for being a coffee shop. Although the space is huge, there are only a few seats available so you can still get some privacy away from the other patrons.  Just like a lot of the restos/cafes in Austin, their building is a very old house, when you walk, the floors creak. But it has a very rustic charm. It's like your grandma's house, full of charm and you'd feel the comfort and warmth brought by the whole ambiance.  Before going in, we didn't know that this is also a shoe and eyeglass store so imagine our surprise when we saw the other wing of the house full of shoes and eyewear display. It was the coolest thing!  My favorite part of this place was the 2 front porch wooden swings. It was like summer vacation from school all over again. Oh, and the coffee was good, too. huge outdoor area such a cute cafe where they also sell shoes/boots",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I really like the rustic charm of this coffee shop. It was warm and cozy on the inside, but the backyard was equally inviting, so we chose to have our coffee there instead.

Coffee Shop 72,"Great place!  I love the service here. These folks really like being here, it's easy to see. They sell shoes and glasses in addition to coffee, and all the merchandise is buy one, give one - just like TOMS anywhere.  The coffee is pretty good, but $4 for a black drip coffee seems a bit extreme. But hey, it helps get water to underdeveloped countries!  Wifi works really well, but  I can see the lack of work tables being a problem. There's lots of outside seating, though!  Will it be my go-to work spot? Probably not.  But I'll most definitely be back here regularly.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Half shoe store, half coffee shop. Tom's roasting room is a pretty sweet place. They have a bunch of sustainably sourced and organic coffee beans which they use to make all your basic coffee drinks. I got a drip coffee made from Guatemalan beans which was pretty good, not spectacular - but then again it's a shoe store.    The place has a pretty chill beach-club-house vibe with lot's of wood, rope, and unfinished looking materials. It's a nice place, and they're constantly reminding you that everything you buy is helping out people across the world, which is cool I guess if you're into morals and all that. Drip coffee. Backyard patio. Table.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"4 check-ins I'm going to have to say this place is really up it's own behind.   Very much the coffee shop that is convenient, has interesting places to sit, chat work etc, but the coffee is just yucky.  I think they mean well with the giving back type stuff, but at the expense of attention to taste detail? I dinno...I'm kinda over giving it chances. sigh* Vanilla coriander latte. I should stick to my chai. Working her magic",0
Coffee Shop 72,"Super cute spot!  I don't think this is a place I will come when I am craving a good coffee. The vanilla latte was a bit too sweet, and no coffee flavor lingered at all - a minus in my book. The regular latte was decent and good quality, but didn't blow me away.  I will say, however, that this shop is very unique - there is a small arrangement of TOMS sunglasses and shoes you can purchase in addition to the espresso bar, and plenty of seating inside and out. The outdoor seating is a carriage house out back with a giant chalkboard to decorate.  I love the personality this place has - there are numerous decorations and unique seating and murals all over the place - seriously, endless picture options, and I love their philanthropic approach to their business.  I think TOMS is a good location for hanging out with friends or grabbing a drink before wandering around South Congress, or even a place to bring your kids. They also show movies if I am not mistaken. But I don't think I'd come here specifically for the drinks or to study either. one of the tables! inside the carriage out back 2-shot latte See all photos from Hanna J. for TOMS",1
Coffee Shop 72,"2 check-ins As a total Toms addict, I was a little disappointed in the retail selection here -- there wasn't enough stuff for me to buy! I think the focus is really on the coffeehouse portion and they figured, ""Well, we have to at least make an effort to sell a few shoes here.""  Good news is, the drinks were awesome! We went twice. I had tea day one and cold brew coffee day two. Both were very refreshing.  If I lived in Austin this would be my go-to spot to hang out, work remotely, have casual business meetings, etc. Their inside space is pretty big and well decorated. Their outdoor space is equally inviting.",1

My six friends and I were waiting for a brunch table at Cafe No Se, so we came here for a cup of coffee. We did enjoy the outside seating (and my cappuccino was pretty good), but it's just such an odd place..with a lot of weirdly used space. I don't know - it's a fine place to wait for your brunch table, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to try it. But...in the spirit of full disclosure - I don't own a single pair of TOMS or any other TOMS merchandise. Maybe it's for  brand loyalists! I certainly think that someone who is into TOMS would get a kick out of it!",0

If you're spending the day on South Congress, you must stop in here. The house has lots of character, complete with a lovely backyard where you can sip and hang out. Great coffee for a great cause, and a fantastic selection of styles for shopping. Sure, you can buy Toms online, but if you're in the area, this can't be missed!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Cute store front, I had no idea it was a coffee shop at first glance. Great selection of Tom's Shoes. I loved getting to try on all the newest styles, never realized there was such a large variety! Coffee & drinks were a little over priced, especially in relation to the size of the cup. I went with family & tried everyone's drinks.. They were great regardless of the tiny portion",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I love the concept of TOMS. This is a cute little coffee shop combined with shopping (eyewear, shoes, blankets, etc). It's pricey but $$ goes towards a good cause + they have cute shoes.    I wasn't a huge fan of the latte I ordered. It was OK, not as sweet as I wanted it to be (-1 star). I did receive amazing service. Shoutout to all of the kind employees who work here, y'all rock! :-)",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in Touristy Things in Austin If you're a TOMS fan and/or you're a hipster, you should come here! My friend, Michelle, loves TOMS and I'm a hipster, so obviously, we had to swing by this TOMS coffeehouse during our recent visit to Austin. I was looking up teahouses in the area and had to do a double take when I saw TOMS on the list of search results, but yes, it's true: it's TOMS, the shoes company! They roast their own beans and sell them by the pound, as well as in the form of handcrafted beverages you can enjoy while perusing the store. There are a few tables inside the cozy coffeehouse (literally, it looks like someone's house), as well as a few outdoor picnic tables in the back. It's a great place to catch up with friends and/or to do some work.  Unfortunately, the coffee is not that great. It's not terrible, but I'm spoiled and my iced americano had too much acidity and not enough flavor. The store is cute, although small-ish. They have one small room dedicated to (women's, men's and children's) shoes and another room dedicated to accessories (bags and sunglasses).  Trés adorable, trés hipster. Of course, you should swing by.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Super friendly and helpful staff. This location is a house that was converted to a Tom's store! Plus they have a small coffee shop inside. They sell shoe, sandal, backpacks, sun glasses and coffees. I love to support Tom's cuz of what they represent--- for every shoe you purchase, a pair is given to the needy. And every backpack you purchase goes towards supporting a birthing kit to aide in safe births around the world. So of course, I had to purchase multiples of everything! Love this place! The 2 I bought to support! Wall of backpacks. Buy one and you support a birthing kit for a mom.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"The day I came here the espresso was phenomenal!  I want to go back just for the espresso.  I wish my coffee trader friend was here to try it.  The quality of the roasted beans was top notch, well balanced, not bitter, creamy and smooth.  It's been awhile since I have had an espresso that just blew me away.  Plus, you get to support water projects while purchasing the coffee, so you feel good also about helping out others.    It's fitting that this is called Toms Roasting Company as it is primarily a coffee community hangout spot.  They do have some food options, they serve Tacodeli daily, and have some baked items (the gluten free chocolate macaroon was delicious).  I would go here just to chill.  All the seating spaces here are great: a porch swing, cozy spacious back room, and a large outdoor patio with all types of cozy cushioned seating spaces (that offer great so co people watching views).  They also offer some great community events each month here (join the mailing list for the event deets).    The retail space for the shoes, bags, and eyeglasses is cramped in a small area.  There is little room to view and try on shoes with the amount of people jammed into the same spot.  I didn't find it pleasant and felt the need to escape vs. purchase. I would rather just buy my beloved Toms online; which I suppose you could do from a table on your computer, utilizing the WIFI while sipping your coffee. double espresso with gluten free macaroon See all photos from Mindy H. for TOMS",1
Coffee Shop 72,"The selection was quite large for such a small shop! The sales lady was helpful but not pushy. I found these sweet shoes in black leather-the adult version of a saltwater sandal! (You know what I'm talking about if you spent your childhood in the Pacific Northwest!) 1 week in and they are so comfortable, versatile and well made. Adult version of a Saltwater Sandal from childhood!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in Austin Coffee What an adorable little shop! I finally had the chance to visit and I enjoyed my time here. I ordered a cold brew and my friend got a latte, and we sipped on them while browsing through the many selections available in store. TOMS has really upgraded and become trendy over the years - a sharp contrast to the plain grey TOMS I've had in the past. The inside area was a bit small and very quiet, and the back area had a lot of light.The outside area is spacious and faces the street; I got to sit comfortably on one of their Acapulco chairs and enjoy the breezy weather that day. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will be back next time I'm in SOCO!",1
Coffee Shop 72,Loved this store/coffee shop/lounge. Serenity oozed from the moment I stepped into the courtyard.  Smiling employees greeted me and were willing to help me find what I needed. The coffee bar had great natural juice drinks also.,1
Coffee Shop 72,We had the horchatta coffee. Not bad. There's just something about a shoe company that also sells coffee. I can't really can't put my toe on it.:) Cute seating in the front. Those lounge stringy chairs were cool.,1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in Reviews of 2015, Shopping, Coffee Shops I'm not a coffee girl, but my feet love my TOMS. Who knew there was a TOMS coffee shop?! Thanks again to Yelp and my fellow Yelpers, I did.  I found myself downtown and in need of shoes. After researching the area, there is practically a shortage of stores of any kind. But I'm glad that I discovered this one. It was about a two mile walk down Congress, in the opposite direction of the Capitol. It really wasn't a bad walk at all. On the way back, once my feet were treated, I stopped in at a few on the shops along the way.  The two staff that assisted me were extremely helpful and kind, not too overly sale pitchy either. I wasn't sure which one I wanted to buy, but they were patient. I ended up going with the lacy TOMS. I was afraid that the lace like material would rub my heels, but he assured me that they give or stretch a little and they did. They basically molded to my feet. I absolutely love them... they were worth every penny. Dear God, I hope you weren't reading this review looking for a coffee recommendation.  They had a water station and I even had the barista fill my cup with ice. She was just as kind as the shoe sales team. I'm not sure why Jo's, across the street had such a long line and TOMS was basically dead. The atmosphere was way cooler here, they even have a hammock!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I am in love with this store. I want it's interior, including the shoes and apparel, to be my house.  Pros: -Located in the heart of SoCo, right next to the famous Homeslice and across Hopdoddys! -the new shoe designs are HOT. They really upped their game! -new bags are pretty sweet, and purchasing one will benefit a new charity to sponsor women and their newborns -I don't care if the ""fad"" of helping shoeless children has faded for people, or if the ulterior motive for the owners could possibly be just making money; their effort to help children around the world is noble and amazing. -The coffee shop inside, also by Toms, is pretty awesome. Percentage of sales go towards providing clean water in (so far) three countries -this is the hottest place to study or hang out. There's great lighting from the neat looking wall/windows. There are seats inside and outside with Mexican blankets hanging off the sides. -play ping pong under a sea of garden lights during your study break! -or sit by the sleek, golden fireplace while reading their beautifully designed catalog -or lay in one their hammocks outside while sipping on their cold brew. You might as well buy one of their sunglasses if you need a pair! -or do it all!  Cons: Nothing bad to say here!",1
Coffee Shop 72,I met the girlfriend here after I ordered some pizza down the street. What can I say... This place is unbelievable! I have never heard of it before but all you need to know is they GIVE as you buy! They offer many different things from coffee to sunglasses to shoes. Best part is that depending on which one you get they give back to people in need! I bought the girl a nice ring and shoe purchased some boots that she loves. It definitely feels great that our purchase helps those who need it more than us!,1
Coffee Shop 72,"My review is based on SXSW. We walk up. Super chill vibe. Some of the best music in the neighborhood. I get some drinks, and I ask, ""How much?"" She says, ""Free."" I say, ""Ha ha. No seriously. How much?"" She says, ""It's free. No joke."" I say, ""Whoa. I love TOMS.""",1
Coffee Shop 72,Free coffee? A store full of TOMS shoes and sunglasses? Nice shop workers? A good stop on South Congress. They also have some great seats (including hammocks!) outside to perch on while people watching and enjoying your coffee :),1
Coffee Shop 72,"2 check-ins Friend: Hey Gary, what'd you do this weekend? Me: Oh I was at the TOMS store reading a book. Friend: Wait you were reading at a shoe store? Me: Yea! Friend: You're weird man. Me: Thanks.  Me: They are a coffee shop too, with an outdoor patio and everything. Friend: Oh wow that's cool, how's their coffee? Me: Pretty good. They make good espresso drinks. Friend: So you like grab a coffee and sit outdoors? Me: Yea they have hammock chairs and picnic table benches outside! Friend: Sweet that sounds cool man.  Me: Yea it's pretty cool. Sometimes TOMS will have local community events here too. Like one time I saw the movie 10 Things I Hate About You here. Friend: Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were studs man. Me: Yea they were. After the movie, I played some ping pong since they have a ping pong table. The staff here are just super friendly and cool like that. Friend: Wow this place sounds amazing. I'm adding this place on my list of places to try. Me: Yes I definitely recommend trying this place out! Friend: Thanks man. You're still weird though.  Conversation Ended.",1
Coffee Shop 72,2 check-ins Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee Eek keep me away from here! I have been to Toms Roasting Co to grab a Topo Chico and check out the shoe selection. Both visits I walked out with a new pair of Toms.  Toms offers informative and fun coffee classes on their front patio. The patio has chairs sprawled out inviting customers to stay for awhile. They also have a charming porch swing facing South Congress. When you walk inside the pleasant smell of freshly roasted beans fills the air. The boutique area sells a handsome selection of glasses and some to die for shoes. I purchased a pair of their super cute wedges and a pair of black crocheted flats. Shoes! Tasting class,1
Coffee Shop 72,"For those who wear TOMS and are into buy 1 give 1, this TOMS shop is a must-visit place. The decor is simple, but very well planned, and there is absolutely adorable outside sitting area with swings. I tried their cold brew coffee, my friends had iced espresso drinks. The coffee is way too strong, so if you are used to Starbucks, TOMS will kick your taste buds. Don't hesitate and add some home made whipped cream for little extra: nice twist.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Love the feeling here, like I actually have a porch and backyard. Would love some lemonade.  Checked out the merch, grabbed a horchata cold brew (bad idea.. horchata does not mix with coffee). Try some of the new exotic drinks. People are nice, setup is sweet, would come back just to hang out.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"4 check-ins This may be my new favorite place on SoCo to stop for a coffee and take some time to relax (sorry Jo's I still love you as well but you don't have the nice outdoor seating that Toms has).    The storefront is a converted older home with a coffee bar in the front to the right, and to the left is a retail front for sunglasses/eye glasses and shoes.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  If you can't locate the shoe you want, they will look online for you and give you a free shipping code.    The iced coffee was delicious and I will order it again.  Toms will be great for year round visiting as they have ample outdoor seating- porch swings, hammocks and benches all around the property.  Inside there is a fireplace which I'm looking forward to sitting by in the winter.  And how can you go wrong with a knit-bombed tree?  You can't. Nice hammock in the back and the knit-bombed tree.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I had chai latte and the flavor really reminds me of the cinnamon Necco wafers I used to buy at the corner convenience store as a kid. Really spicy and delicious. Still not the best chai I've ever had, but definitely the spiciest. Who knew that TOMs had a coffee shop?! See all photos from Crystal M. for TOMS",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Everyone knows Toms for their buy a pair and donate a pair. They do the same for their eyewear. This cute little shop has both and more! Clothes and coffee!

Coffee Shop 72,Happy Father's Day morning coffee - ahhhh!  This is our first visit to Tom's and very happy to have made the trek from waaaay north for this deliciously roasted cup of Vanilla Coriander Latte. It's a great start to our morning!  They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating-very cozy. You can shop while you wait there's lots of fun to consider. Tiny business with far reaching influences,1
Coffee Shop 72,"3 check-ins I love to go to check shoes and bags at Toms in SoCo! the staff is really friendly and helpful. Even when I returned some shoes that were a big bigger for me, they were really nice and tried to help me to find my correct size. This is also a perfect spot to get  a nice coffee any time of the week or weekend. The best part? they are also puppy friendly and some days they have bands playing outside! check the patio out! it is very nice and comfy even during these hot days!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Very cool coffee house.  This place is one strange bird indeed -  being a fusion coffee house, eyeglasses store, shoe store and charity donation stop  with a heavy emphasis on Save the Planet! Fair Trade For All!.  The buzz is if you are in this building you are saving the world, and you probably are an artist, a philosopher and an activist too.  Hey, flattery will get you everywhere - and I ain't exempt.  The coffee is legitimately superb. (Beautfiully bitter and with very creative and interesting mixed coffee drinks. The menu is not Starbucks redux yada yada yada. They got new things to drink.)  The decorating is superlative.  (Worn wood plank tables, brass brazier with an open flame for cold weather, chalkboard maps of locations in the global south where they are making a difference etc.)  The crowd is one of the coolest of any I have seen in an Austin coffee house - and that is a formidable statement given who is sitting next to you in the top tier of Austin coffee establishments.  Are you really saving the world if you drink their coffee?  Probably not as much as you would be if you wrote a $1000 check to Oxfam, or you were working to build ecotourism, or you were fighting the good fight opposing international land grabs.  But pennies count - and the pennies here go to a good cause.  And the food and the ambience and the crowd are totally seductive.  Count me in.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"3 check-ins I do own a pair of Toms sunglasses, but I didn't buy it because I thought I was saving a kid in some poor country. For me, I prefer donating directly to the nonprofit organizations of my choice.  I was very hesitant about getting coffee here. What does a shoe company know about coffee? Well I was wrong. I had one of the best cafe au lait in recent memory here this past weekend. My husband's Malawi pourover was also excellent. The barista was friendly and I like the casual, open environment.  Go ahead, grab a cup of coffee, sit on the lawn and enjoy the people watching.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"TOMS has a plan to take over the world, but they are doing so whilst running coffee shops and dishing out shoes to third world countries.  My evidence for their ambitions to pull off a lifelong desire of Pinky and the Brain? They own a coffee shop on South Congress, post-2009 housing crash. With Austin real estate skyrocketing, this philanthropic coffee shop snatched up a prime location. They now sling out their own beans in assorted beverages--alongside TacoDeli tacos of course (another company aptly prepared to run shop on corporate Austin).  The coffee quality is decent, the space eclectic, and the service good. For anyone who desires a funky shop, deeply rooted on a feel-good foundation, this shop fulfills those itches.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Love this shoe shop/coffee shop.... really interesting/unique space with a small coffee bar, but large seating area, both indoor and out. It's an awesome converted house that embodies the TOMS brand completely.  I had the vanilla coriander latte, which sounded a bit odd, but tasted delicious. The coffee was smooth and super tasty, and I'd come back in here any time, just for a cup.They had some unique concoctions like the maple cardamom espresso (it was not for me but my partner enjoyed it a lot) as well as the good old-fashioned latte menu. I would absolutely recommend their coffee - I was hesitant when I first saw it at my local whole foods, since, you know, they make shoes... but it's a good cup.    We came this time for coffee AND shoes, and though they had good stuff (we walked away with three pairs), the selection was a little smaller than I was expecting. If you have a specific pair in mind, it would likely be better to order online. Huge selection of sunglasses and frames, though.  Tom's has the SoCo vibe down, so if you're shopping on congress, this a great place to stop and take a break - particularly to enjoy their outdoor seating on nice weather days. They also have juices and a small selection of food from greencart if you're wanting to grab a quick bite.",1
Coffee Shop 72,What a great coffee shop! The sitting area is fun  and dog friendly.  The service was exceptional and the coffee was delicious.  It was definitely made with care.  If you buy a bag of beans you are supporting a town with water for a week.  We really liked supporting a cause like this one. It's a great spot and we wished we could have hung out here longer.,1
Coffee Shop 72,I really enjoyed my tasty iced vanilla coriander latte. There was a generous dollop of vanilla and it was just sweetened right. I love the atmosphere- cozy inside and out with a lovely swing outside. If I lived here I might study here or chill. Wall with countries helped,1
Coffee Shop 72,"The coffee isn't the best and if it didn't have the name Toms on the door I wouldn't go back. But I know the company does a lot of positive things and the little coffee shop is so adorable so I continue to go back every time I'm in Austin. It's very quaint and feels a little tucked away, plus everyone is so friendly! A definite must.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Always a favorite coffee shop to hang out in.  It's got great seating, the internet works and is easy and it's Tom's!  I like their chai, it's a great mix and pretty delicious.  They have indoor and outdoor seating which is pretty awesome too.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Yes! This place is so cute and pretty much exactly what I expected. I had a meeting for work and breezed by the line snaking around the corner at the ""I love you so much"" establishment down the street, parked for free, grabbed my coffee, and hopped onto their wifi.  It was perfect weather outside and we sat out there, since there weren't any open tables inside. However, I would've preferred to have sat at a regular table, as I had a meeting sitting on a bench with the person I was with sitting on a tiny wooden chair made out of wood branches.It was pretty humorous, but not ideal.  I'll be coming back to this serene spot for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I love the environment! The outside seating area in the front is so relaxing. It's a great spot to just people watch and enjoy the beautiful weather. If you are wearing a pair of Toms, they also give you a free coffee! I had no idea, but one of the employees told me about it which was so nice! I'm not a huge fan of their lattes, but I enjoyed my ice coffee. I asked them to add hemp milk to it and they said it was not a problem. It's a really cool place to visit in Austin especially on perfect 75 degree days.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"2 check-ins At first, I thought this Toms store opened just for SXSW. But I guess it's a permanent space. The layout is half retail store and half a coffee house. Are they trying to get coffee drinkers to buy Tom shoes and sunglasses or vice versa? I don't know. It look really nice in the inside where it seems they kept some of the layout of the house. They also have a nice patio and yard for people to relax with their coffee. They also sell Organic Juices from a self serve fridge. Out on the front porch, there are a couple of swings where you can sit down and people watch. I had a cold brewed coffee which is pretty good. Food for thought. Chimney for the cold nights. The front porch in case you are in a swinging mood. See all photos from Bernadette D. for TOMS",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I'm a huge fan of the laid back atmosphere, the feeling of my purchases giving back and the community feel of TOMS. Both my pup and I enjoy our weekly visits. Plus they have hemp milk, which is a divine alternative to cow milk.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in Austin Hipster Texas Such a cute coffee shop and store!! There is an awesome porch swing out front, seating out front, out back and inside. I was in TOMS heaven with the vibe.  I tried something that seemed unique to the store - Vanilla Coriander Latte. I like that kind of earthy flavor, so I enjoyed how different it was. It wasn't overly sweet, so it was refreshing. It cost more than I would have liked, over $5 for 16 oz and the cup is flimsier plastic so the lid wasn't secure.  However I would totally go back! Vanilla Coriander Latte",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in 2014 Reviews Full disclosure: I made a special trip to the new Tom's store because they sent me a fantastic coupon. $40 off my shoes? Yes please.  The new store/ coffee house is a super cute hangout space and a nice addition to South Congress. They have a nice selection of their shoes as well as glasses and sunglasses. The employees were helpful and really friendly.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but it seems like a great place to grab a latte and have a seat outside.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"LOVEeeEEEee this place.  For starters the decor from outside to inside, from front patio to back patio, from store front to back, and even the bathroom, is über cute.  Very trendy and the attention to such detail, I really can appreciate that. *snaps for the design team* snap snap.  The coffees and teas are so yummy especially the vanilla coriander and the chai tea. Don't forget to stay a little while. Relax, embrace, and enjoy this quaint little coffee house in the soco district.  Maybe if you feel like splurging a little. Snag some Toms shoes on the way out or maybe some sun shades to block all the hater?! Idk.  #TreatYoSelf  **only complaint: we coffee addicts wouldn't mind bigger cups. Cheers.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"In my never-ending quest to visit Austin's coffee shops, I headed over to Toms this morning. I could tell just walking up to their cute little storefront house that I was going to enjoy this one. They have a decent amount of outdoor seating between the front and back, two porch swings (my personal favorite), and a few hammocks, too.  Inside, they showcase their products (shoes, sunglasses, journals) in one area of the house. It's a fun spot to peruse. Very well set up and quite a few of what I assume are their newer products.  In the back room there's a cozy seating area. A few benches and tables, as well as cushioned seats. They also offer a container of cucumber water, which is a nice touch.  Now to the coffee part: I got the cappuccino. A small comes with two shots and a large with four. Their cups are small so that's a great coffee/milk ratio, in my opinion. I hadn't heard of their coffee beans, but it was a nice flavor. The baristas were pretty friendly and they made a beautiful heart for my latte art. Gotta love the latte art!  All in all, this coffee shop has a great vibe. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a place to catch up with a friend, or just relax. I haven't been to Jo's yet, but Toms doesn't have a ridiculously long line, has better seating, and it's just up the street. I'll be back!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"3 check-ins I've gotten the iced vanilla coriander latte a few times now and it's usually great. Sometimes it's not very well mixed and I ended up swallowing a mouthful of spices. The baristas I've encountered are all friendly and engaging, which I mostly like unless I'm thoroughly exhausted or distracted by other things on my mind. Then I just want my coffee! They offer a selection of pastries and breakfast tacos, and have non-coffee options such as Kosmic Kombucha and Daily Greens. Yay!  Toms is a nice place to sit down and read a book for an hour or two, or even get a little work done. They also have a lot of cool events going on each month, like free yoga and other fitness events!  Oh, but my friend witnessed the barista ""double-tamp"" while preparing her coffee. I don't speak coffee, but she didn't seem happy about it.",1

Coffee Shop 72,"Apparently I came on the right weekend because this place hasn't even been opened for a week! The place still smells like new! (No lie)  So here's the nitty gritty: I ordered the mocha coffee and the Chai tea for a friend. Both were surprisingly very good! Initially I wanted something off of the specialty menu, but alas... everything was already sold out! (Keep in mind it was Sunday afternoon) south by southwest must have sucked this place dry! The mocha coffee was kind of sweet, but I felt like it had the right mixture of mocha and coffee which didn't make the coffee overwhelming sweet nor bitter -- but just right. The Chai tea was surprisingly very good!! It wasn't thick and it wasn't too sweet either!  The interior is very welcoming and I can definitely see myself coming back the next time I visit Austin! I especially loved how it was a mini retail store plus coffee shop. Job well done Toms!",1
Coffee Shop 72,TOMS shoes are comfortable.  We happen to be on Congress and decided to go check out the store. From outside it was very inviting. It felt more like a home and the interior was homey. I liked how helpful the employees were and my hubby and I ended up buying a matching pair of shoes. We're dorks.,1
Coffee Shop 72,"2 check-ins I finally was able to check this place out during my holiday break from work. It was the perfect cold weather for a hot and fresh chai tea latte  Loved checking out all of the merchandise. I know a lot of what you pay for gets sent back to the less fortunate, but I can never see myself spending over $100 for a pair of glasses or close to that for shoes that I will wear out to festivals and stuff. I 100% support the effort behind it, but for now will just be supporting though caffeine consumption.  Fits in perfectly on Soco, could not think of a better location for this!",1

Coffee Shop 72,"Good coffee.  Nice looking place, but a bad experience.  I've been twice and had a great experience the first time.  Second time was bad enough to make me not want to go back.  I asked for 1/2 and 1/2 for my drink.  They said they didn't have any.  I asked if she was serious, and she said yes.  They get a shipment tomorrow.  No apologies.  Simply offered me whole milk and nothing else.  They are a coffee shop.  People drink coffee with 1/2 and 1/2.  To not have it, and worse, not offer an apology for not having it is ridiculous.  There are a million places within a mile to buy 1/2 and 1/2.  No excuse.  But again, worst part if the attitude at my being incredulous that a coffee shop not have cream.  Of course, like the rest of those who serve in this city, the Austin hipsters working there don't feel they owe an apology because they are who they are.",0
Coffee Shop 72,"First time visit. It is a old house, half coffee shop half store from Tom's Co, the shoes canvas mogul. It is small and intimate inside. Has a very calm vibe. Talked  to a lady that is going with Tom to Peru and I gave her a tip. Apple Cider Vinegar to prevent stomach issues. You put some on your food or mix it with olive oil or other oil as a dressing . Don't use it if you have ulcers or gastritis.  Anyway, it has a porch with a swing like a old southern house at front . Very relaxing. They have sandwiches, homemade breads , tea, coffee and non alcoholic drinks. Good place to relax. Will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in Austin My friend and I stumbled into Tom's in SoCo sweaty, weary and thirsty.  We instantly perked up when we realized this was not only a Tom's coffee shop - this air conditioned paradise also had a Tom's store!  I scored the most adorable wedges with a black and white geometric pattern (the last pair in my size, yay)!  My friend found a groovy pair of shades and we both walked back into the Austin heat with killer iced coffees.  Bathrooms were clean and spacious (which was important because I had to put down my umpteen shopping bags).",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Im a huge fan on Toms' company's philosophy and what they do for the good of society. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised to see they had their own coffee shop.

The outting in the back is spacious and beautiful.",1
Coffee Shop 72,Love this place INSIDE and OUT! The Vanilla Coriander Iced Latte is a must try!!! And of course have it with almond milk! Great place to have a nice sit down/relax and people watch.... read a book/catch up on emails from work or just simply sit on the front porch on the swing chair like I did!,1
Coffee Shop 72,I love the environment both inside and outside of TOMS! I also like how it is a coffee shop and a shoe/glasses store of their products. From what I saw it looked like they have every Toms shoe there is in their store. They also have a wide selection of glasses/sunglasses.    I ordered a Chai Latte and it was pretty good and had a strong kick to it from the spice. I got it cold since it was super hot outside. I also tried some of my friend's capuccino and it was very strong! Free water is also provided for anyone. The water tasted delicious with the lemons they have floating in it.    The seating area was nice and cozy. Typical coffee shop set up to me. You would think they don't have any restrooms when they actually do because the restrooms doors are practically camouflaged with the walls! Outside of the shop there are hammocks and chairs so that you can enjoy your coffee while enjoying the weather.,1
Coffee Shop 72,"Do you enjoy coffee on your porch swing, patio, or hammock? Well if you're visiting Austin you don't have to leave that behind. This is probably an upgrade to what you have at home anyway. And you can do some shoe shopping while you're at it!  This house is decked out with plenty of outdoor seating. You can people watch from the coffee table along South Congress or the two 3-person porch swings. There is also plenty of seating in the backyard, along with a couple hammocks.  The coffee is on point. I recommend starting your day off here before you head anywhere else for breakfast.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Good latte and good space to sit and rest your feet from shopping.  If you are feeling super hipsterish, go to their outside sitting area!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I had to stop by here this morning on my way to work to see what it was all about.  PROS: -Open at 6 a.m. -Giving Jo's down the street some much-needed competition -Good iced coffee with alt milk selection -Mild sense of charity when purchasing a drink, which the barista tells me will buy one day of water for a person in Africa (?) -They serve tacos from Fresa's! -Shoes, eyewear and a little lounge space, plus an outdoor firepit, makes me think that could be a cute spot to visit after work  CONS: -Fuzzy explanation of charitable work - maybe the baristas need better training on this point -$3.50 for 16oz -Slightly corny Tom's ethos prevalent throughout the space - fair trade, trying too hard vibes",1
Coffee Shop 72,"So the concept for this coffee shop is as wholesome as any other Tom product and serves as a vehicle for bringing funds and awareness to really important social impact endeavors. The vibe and set up of the spot is well done, clean & showcases all Tom's products along side some locally made products. Community yoga, tastings & movie showings round out the place, and adds a lot of value to this already busy street. The coffee is also damn good! Bravo!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I can appreciate a place that encourages positivity and this is exactly it!! I was greeted across the street on Soco with ""You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great""  Totally reminds me of that one episode of Portlandia when the home owners association purposely hires somebody to post encouraging messages on the window of the house to attract visitors and raise the value of the houses in that neighborhood xD  ANYWAY.  Regardless of their intention, it uplifted my mood that morning and made me walk in! After all, it is the first TOMS store I've ever seen!  So this house is nice and cozy. I didn't try their coffee since I already got my fix at Jo's. But their TOMS shoe selection seemed to have some special collections and they also had an eyewear collection. All of these products are a part of their buy one give one program. I also like how it is a full on coffee house. There's room to sit in the back and a backyard as well! I like how they put the seating in the back where you don't constantly have to be interrupted by shoppers- good thinking there. Oh btw, the seating area is incredibly cute with their uber comfy chairs.  I'll be back when I'm in Austin :)",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Listed in Austin with kids Just moved to Austin from San Antonio, and I was looking for an iced latte to rival SA's Local Coffee. Fortunately I found Tom's! The iced latte was perfect.  They also have an amazing yard and patio area, with plenty of seating. Will definitely  return.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Walked in for a cup of coffee and left with a $60 pair of shoes.  I guess the shoes are only $30 since the soles of mine say my purchase will put new shoes on the feet of a child in need overseas.  Now I'll have to come back and buy 10 more pairs that I like, and it wasn't even the caffeine that got me.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"Cute little place on South Congress. It's a coffee shop and a shoe/glasses store in one. Had a delicious latte and other drinks. The outdoor area in back looks really relaxing. It's a corporate business, but it's got a nice ""we tried to fit into the Austin vibe"" feel. Jo's down the street does it just as well, but this was a nice change. And next time I want Tom's shoes, I'd go here first. Enjoyed our drinks.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I am a fan of fair trade. I love that it is trendy and oh so prevalent in our world today. I adore so much of Austin because there is an emphasis on awareness of one's choices  with regards to diet and exercise and values. People matter. It is tremendously exciting to have a store in Austin specifically for TOMS. The store is smack dab in the middle of South Congress, and it is darling. Little wooden porch swings and an outside hearth greet visitors as they climb up the steps and enter the store. A coffee shop is on the right hand side. I selected the Peru blend for purchase as well as in the form of a cold latte. The cold brew was TASTY- get it! The store also has eyewear as well as shoes, which I shall browse on another day:). It is a gorgeous day in Austin, and it is time well spent to sip a cold cup while swinging on a porch swing at TOMS. Do it.",1
Coffee Shop 72,The cold brew iced coffee is awesome. And on a hot summer afternoon the honey mint Palmer with black tea is my favorite. Fun vibe.,1
Coffee Shop 72,"Toms coffee is excellent! I had the Malawi pourover. The barista was friendly and we had a great conversation. The coffee was poured expertly. When I was there, they had an end of Movember event where people were getting shaved by hand with straight razors. This place is more than just a coffee shop, it's becoming a fixture within South Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"First to Review Cute space made up of a cafe, sitting area, and store.  Will stop by again for a latte once they offer decaf and flavorings. Shopping! Dig the signage The Menu See all photos from I I. for TOMS",1
Coffee Shop 72,So excited to see a Toms here.  Their coffee is perfect and the atmosphere here is very calm/relaxing and fun.  Lots of different areas to sit and just chat.,1
Coffee Shop 72,Never knew TOMS shoes have a coffee shop.  This place is such a darling little cafe shop.  I absolutely love the environment here! A one stop shop... COFFEE and SHOES! What not to love!,1
Coffee Shop 72,"Awesome outdoor space with plenty of seating. There is a small retail section inside , but the majority of the space is dedicated to community areas and the coffee shop. Excellent coffee and great indoor and outdoor spaces.",1
Coffee Shop 72,"So many awesome things tastefully collected in one place: beautiful place to browse and chill, yummy coffee drinks (and the honey mint Palmer for an iced, non-coffee treat), bags of coffee to take home (which they can also grind for you), cool shoes, fun eyewear, a sampling of other social enterprise products from the TOMS marketplace... And all of it positively impacts people around the world through sustainable business and giving. I love that there is now a physical place to access all this!",1
Coffee Shop 72,"I bought a pair of expensive sunglasses ($150+) from this place a couple of weeks ago. I was so proud of them; I showed them to everyone. Last weekend, I ended up bending the frame. I was upset, but then thought, ""These are TOMS! That awesome company will definitely replace/repair these! Even corporate-driven Sunglass Hut replaces sunglasses""  So I went into the store today and showed them my sunglasses. I was told that I needed to speak with a manager, but that she wasn't available. I said I didn't mind waiting, considering we are talking about $150+ sunglasses. After thirty minutes of standing in the corner, the same girl came up and said that her manager told her that they didn't replace sunglasses, but that I could have a free cup of coffee. A free cup of coffee?!? I couldn't believe it. So, I asked to speak with the manager myself, to which I was told no. No?!?! Why not? I just want to talk about this. This is a minor bend and they were only 10 days old. I decided that this store was not the place I thought it was and left.  I will not be buying anything from TOMS ever again. I would rather spend $300 on a pair of sunglasses and donate another $300 to the Red Cross before entrusting these guys with my money and respect.  Thanks TOMS, welcome to the neighborhood.",0
Coffee Shop 72,Was here for an event and besides the very flappy rugs in the back room that can trip you this place is awesome. Staff and their service were a ok,1
Coffee Shop 72,"Excellent pour over coffee and espressos in an old house converted to a cafe and store.  There's limited seating inside and a couple of picnic tables in the open back yard area.  They offer a selection of beans for both the pour over and the espresso.  Both were excellent, close to the best in town (No one beats Beware but this gets close enough for 5 stars).",1
Coffee Shop 72,Such a great atmosphere! Absolutely love the The Carriage House out back- plug in your music and enjoy a cup of coffee! So relaxing!,1
Coffee Shop 72,i love TOMS... and to find a cafe with TOMS store and a place to sit and chill was just the icing on the cake!,1
Coffee Shop 72,"Good iced coffee, fun atmosphere. Good cause.",1
Coffee Shop 72,LOVE this place. Good coffee and atmosphere. Super friendly employees! Can't wait until it's a little cooler out to take advantage of the back patio area.,1
Coffee Shop 28,Seriously the best Iced Chai in Austin.  I am not a coffee fan and I get tired or regular old iced tea.  Close to my house and has a loyalty program for the people that just can't get enough.  Great service too.  I have been the first person to walk in the door before and I was greeted with nothing but smiles and warm welcomes.  This is my regular place now and have introduced quite a few of my friends to it too.  They all agree.... best in town.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"Room nice.  Plain coffee meh.  They have intriguing over-the-top mochas.  However, that is not the headline story here.  *  What is the headline story?  POPCORN!  POPCORN! POPCORN! POPCORN! POPCORN! POPCORN!  Not disgusting movie popcorn.  Real deal homemade style popcorn.  * I have just received a protest email from NANWWACH.  NANWWACH is the  National Association of Nerds Who Work At Coffee Houses.  I, personally, am a charter member.  NANWWACH says that popcorn is a terrible thing to have at a coffee house,  because popcorn done right is greasy, and the grease gets on your fingers  So if you are working on a computer the grease gets on your keyboard or on your mouse.  *  Dear NANWWACH.  I don't care.  Popcorn is simply a higher spiritual calling -  and is the greatest thing to have next to you while you are working.  Sincerely yours,  Samuel C.  * So bring napkins. Bring paper towels.  Hey, bring a whole carwash if you think that is what you will need.  Genuine Joe's has its charms.  And if you like your coffee concoctions sweeter and more elaborate than plain old black -  then you might get into the coffee as well.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"The artist group I belong to had a planning meeting here for the East Studio Tour.  They were busy and had a bunch of meetings that were planned already inside the three rooms so we sat on the patio out front.  There is plenty of parking behind this old house turned coffee shop.  It appears that to reserve a room you have to have it up on the board as we were told by a guy who was a little angry we walked into the room he had reserved.  I got the iced latte and it was served in a plastic cup like you would use at home.  The vibe is pretty cool here and my latte was good.  There wasn't anything truly notable that stood out about this place but, our time here was enjoyable all the same.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I came here because it was the highest rated coffee shop near me at the time, and I'm very happy I did!  There's quite a bit of parking behind the seemingly-small coffee shop, so I parked behind the shop and walked in. The inside is colorful and full of character with a short but sweet menu above the register area. There were quite a few people there working or reading scattered across the mismatched couches and various tables and chairs.  After perusing the menu, I chose to go with an iced soy dirty chai tea latte because of the clever sign they had up (I don't exactly remember it, but I recall it played on the ""dirty"" part of the order). They charge an extra eighty cents for soy milk, which is the most I've ever had to pay for it, but it was alright because I really enjoyed my drink! It came in a long tall glass and was mixed well, although I would've hoped for a bit more of the chai flavor.  They have two other rooms besides the main one where you place your order, similarly decorated. There's a single-stall bathroom that was very clean, which I appreciated!  I'm happy I stopped by, I'd definitely come here agian! My adorable small iced soy dirty chai tea latte!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin. The vibe is perfect, the varied seating is a nice choice. I like that you can reserve rooms for meetings and pay via drink purchases. The Dirty Chai is excellent!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Nice cozy coffee shop somewhat closer to where we live. Wifi worked really well, staff were friendly, and the sofa I napped on was comfortable. Husband is able to get his work done here so we will for sure come back to this location. There are plenty of parking spaces, recommend to those who live in the area.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Eh. I found this randomly while trying to find a place to work from for a few hours.  The wifi is slow. It was very crowded (1 person per table, people had the same idea I did). So that might be why.  I sat outside and it was very noisy and smelly. It's off of Anderson Ln. and next to a Mex restaurant. But there was also scents of dog poo and trash.  Parking lot has spaces though so that was nice.  I will try and find another place in the future to work from...",0
Coffee Shop 28,"4 check-ins Best everything!!!  I love the ppl that work here. I love the drinks they whip up here. I love the Austin vibe here. They totally support local artists, and they are very much worth a visit in!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Having been in recent need of somewhere to do some thinkin' and tea-drinkin', Joe gets the 4 stars. However, as I don't drink coffee anymore, this review may be a little misplaced. Again: I don't drink coffee. Theirs could be great. It could suck. I do not know. It smells pretty good. Mainly I drink tea and eat their gf/vegan stuff.  GJ is open a healthy chunk of the time. They have ok wifi. Their tea selection is ok. They will give you free hot water refills on your tea of choice. They've got 'all fruit' smoothies, sodas, water, some of the flavored syrups. They have a nice bunch of gf/vegan pastries, as well as some premade sandwiches and salads in a cold case. The barista service has always been cordial, if slow when the line gets busy. I don't blame 'em - if the mgmt knows they only need X baristas to sling my tea, I am not complaining.  The crowd at GJ is mellow, and the music (often of a song-driven nature) is usually at a respectable volume such that you can get work done here if working-at-coffee-shop is your thing. There are almost always people here toiling away on their notebook computers; the regulars here are beginning to look like barflys to me, except they stare into computer screens and eat biscotti instead of liquoring and staring at televisions. I did see one guy leave after a few hours and then come back and eat half a pizza in here the other day, so somebody respects their regulars.  In summer the a/c is adequate, cozy in the fall/winter. They have two meeting rooms where you can pay to have your group gather for a variety of things. The rooms, like the rest of the place, are fairly funky Austin / ramshackle decor, so when I say ""meeting rooms"", do not expect perfectly climate-controlled spaces with motorized drop down screens for your powerpoint presentations. Seating comfort is hit or miss, depending on the chair needs of your rear. There's a small patio out front by Anderson Lane without much shade. There are a couple of mini bars with barstools where you can change up your sitting or standing technique, if you are computing, and lucky enough to score one, which is nice.  Don't be misled by parking in front, where there's only 3 spaces + a handicapped space - you can park in the back lot. I've never been here when it was so full that I'd have to park on a side street, but you could probably do that if you needed to.... for now.  I thank you, GJ, for being my go-to coffee joint in the area. (Others may suggests Monkeynest, which does several of the consumable things better, has sorbet! and is open 24/7 - but their a/c is crap, they are often maxed out in seating due to the burgeoning population of the Burnetty area, and have live music 3-4 days a week, which I find is not so good for the concentrating).",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Way laid back coffee shop with a subversive edge.  I was recommended this place by a gay friend, who said friends of his opened the place years ago and this was his favorite place to go when he lived in Austin. I didn't notice much in the way of gay pride though. This mostly just looks like a very lived-in, cozy coffee shop with worn and comfortable chairs.  The menu isn't huge, but the house coffee rotates and what I had (something from Guatemala) was flavorful. They have a few food items like muffins, breakfast tacos, and sandwiches. My cranberry muffin was a-okay.  Snarky notes here and there might be off-putting to some, while giving others a chuckle. The punk in me loves the huge sign in the parking lot facing their neighbors warning customers that ""our neighbors tow!"". The former business owner in me thinks, we there goes any business you might've gotten from them and their customers.  Loved the smooth bossa nova playing quietly in the background and the almost library-quiet pervading the place. It made an excellent spot to get some work done. It's not a big place, but there's a good amount of seating options and almost always an available electrical outlet.",1
Coffee Shop 28,Love this place. Every time we visit family in Austin we hit Joe's. Great coffee and the breakfast burritos are fantastic. Very friendly and cozy.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"2 check-ins I absolutely love authentic Austin joints like this.  Starbucks is great for convenience and rewards, but Genuine Joe's is, well, genuine.  It is decorated in a way that never leaves you bored. If you're offended easily, I still recommend you go there for the damned good coffee.  I had the Honeynut and he had the Three Way. Amazing. They also have Casa Chapala breakfast tacos. I was very happy for that on a Saturday morning.  My mentor program was able to reserve the large room off to the side for a meeting, with min $25 purchase (for the whole group!). That was a steal of a deal. Spinach taco, bacon taco and Honey Nut Latte. Delish.",1
Coffee Shop 28,The wife came here and I like the decor and ambiance of it and our coffees were good as well. The barista was friendly and overall this seems like a cool spot to chill out at.,1
Coffee Shop 28,Had a bit of time this morning to get some work done so I was looking for a great place to have a coffee. I am so glad that I found this spot. The Costa Rican coffee of the day was amazing. I was able to get my work done in a very cozy space. Highly recommend!,1
Coffee Shop 28,"I'm a huge fan of the grungy, hipster coffee shop. However, to pull off grungy, hipster coffee shop, the place has to be secretly very clean and serve a mean cup of coffee.  Genuine Joe falls short of both requirements.  There were multiple flies buzzing around inside the cafe, and the bathroom seemed to double as a storage unit.  My latte looked and tasted like drip coffee microwaved with half a cup of milk but with the price tag of a well-made latte topped with latte art.  For people who just want a place to get some work done or to experience the don't-care, hip Austin vibe without going downtown, this place can fulfill both goals. There is plentiful indoor and outdoor seating with mismatched chairs, and the clientele isn't the loud chatterbox type. Latte",0
Coffee Shop 28,"I am sitting in GJ right now drinking the worst Americano I've ever had in my life. It tastes of water and brown. I didn't know that brown was a flavor, but I know this flavor now. I am tasting it. I long for ignorance of it.  Thanks Genuine Joe.  Love and Kisses,  Another Joe",0
Coffee Shop 28,"Pretty neat little place, has a ""hole in the wall"" vibe that I enjoy. Had the Toffee Nut Latte and was pretty impressed :) The staff was very nice, also. I'm sure I'll be back.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I like coffee shops, and this one makes me feel right at home. This place makes me feel like I'm back in Cali, and I like that. I think a guy was even working on his screen play. Austin is a pretty cool place, even for us liberals.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Got the three way mocha everyone keeps raving about on here, and after choking down half, gave up and pitched it.  It was way too sweet.  Couldn't even tell if there was coffee in it, just tasted like straight syrup.  It was not good.    Décor wise, the place is trying way to hard to look Austin-y and hip.  I found it obnoxious.  Staff was unpleasant.  I don't have any desire to give them another try.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"Its a coffeeshop. Good, but not outstanding. Decent service, decent coffee, a patio, soft couches, fast wifi, and the bathrooms were clean. I would definitely recommend it,  but I wouldnt drive across town to get here, thats for sure.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"12 check-ins Listed in Thanks a latte! This place won me over with their Honey Nut Latte. The perfect fall beverage for those who don't always appreciate the pumpkin spice (although they have that as well) and it is great hot or cold. Although it is a popular establishment, they have ample parking in the back and the line moves quickly. Their coffee is a bit on the pricey side but I have found all my drinks to be worth it. Don't expect a lot of smiles and fluff from the staff. But if you any sort of competence and sense of humor, you will find the staff is far from rude.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! This spot is situated at the edge of the  Crestview neighborhood, though there were as many cars in the lot as people, so I can't be sure that it's a local haunt, especially being off a major thoroughfare (Anderson Ln), and not at all friendly to walk-ups or bike commuters. When it got to the fifth minute of looking for a place to lock up, I almost left, feeling pretty awkward having explored the entire perimeter of the building before entering. There was no one on the patio, so I stealthily parked there, not that there's signage saying otherwise, but I did feel defensive, which is why I ended up sitting outside. I probably would have made this choice regardless, as it's eerily quiet inside despite the bold decor, and dim, but I liked the variety of seating options: couch, high table, low table, stool ponied up to the window...and a private room that can be reserved for meet ups. That's a special feature you won't find elsewhere. I knocked off a star because my drink was actually pretty bad, but the baristas were flustered from needing to make a bank run, so I helped them out by paying in exact change, and not mentioning that my latte required 2 sugars and cinnamon to taste like more than almond water. What redeemed the visit fully was that someone asked to join my table, it being the only dry one outside, which left the impression that the clientele feels really comfortable around each other, and with themselves, enough to talk to ""strangers!""",1
Coffee Shop 28,2 check-ins This is a great little Austin coffee shop. Small and intimate setting. Great coffee. I live in the neighborhood so I come here all the time. They have the nicest workers. Very cool people. Very hip place.,1
Coffee Shop 28,I love this cafe! They have great iced coffee and the atmosphere is cozy and unique. It's a great place to read and you can reserve/rent either of their 2 side rooms for meetings or meet-up groups!,1
Coffee Shop 28,"I have enjoyed there coffee for years. Good coffee, great people and it has the Austin vibe.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Listed in Austin This is a great place to be lazy! I came here after lunch with my friend. It was such a gloomy day and we wanted some coffee and just a place to hangout. I actually opted for some of the local Buddah's Brew Kombucha and my friend a Chai Tea with espresso. The place was busy but we were able to snag a seat in the smaller room. We hung out there for a bit and then noticed there was some space open in the bigger room. We moved out there and flipped through the Austin Chronicle.  They have wi-fi so they it would be a good place to work, school work or catch up on stuff. There's tables or couches whatever fits your fancy. Grab a cup of fresh brew and hang out.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I love it here. The atmosphere is perfect to work in, and there is plenty of comfortable seating.  The coffee is good, and the pastry selection is good. It can get a big cold in the winter, and the wifi can drag. When that happens, I have to pick up and go. But Gen Joe's is usually my first choice these days.",1
Coffee Shop 28,I'll give it 3-4 stars since has meeting space .. but coffee/food .. barely 1 star.  Coffee isn't all that + stopped buying pastries when I saw flies flying (and dead) in the case.  Haven't been in a few years.,0
Coffee Shop 28,Pretty cool place to have coffee and chill. This place has both inside and outside seating area with WIFI connection.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"Grungy, very slow service from bored girl. Quiet and still inside. The half-and-half was just kind of unceremoniously open on the counter and I had no idea how long it had been there in its box from the grocery store. Pretty decent iced coffee. I felt sad in there.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"Stopped by before heading up to Dallas and got the 3 way mocha. A little on the hot side to where the caramel wasn't as flavorful as I normally like, but a good and unique mocha!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"This has been my neighborhood coffee shop since it moved in. Yay for living down the street. And here I thought it was a well kept secret! Of course anything near Sunrise, and Enchilada Y Mas is sure to get a ton of foot traffic.  Firstly, I'm a dirty heathen and don't actually drink coffee often. I LOVE my tea, though, and they have Guayaki Yerba Mate which is so good, along with two coolers of other goodies.  The decor to me works. It's inviting and feels comfy. I think Epoch has set a standard for stand alone coffee shops, and while this is similar in it's approach it's still unique enough to where it stands out to me. The music is always subtle but keeps up with the feel of the place, and never overwhelmingly loud to where it's distracting. I don't know how often the art is changed out but it's all local artists and is usually pretty badass! I don't know if they cater to a theme but it's always pretty cool.  The baristas are some of my favorite and combine the right amount of snark and sass. This obviously is personal preference but it feels right to me. I like some sass with my tea. Hah.  It's probably cause I'm from Austin but I appreciate the myriad of non-chain coffee spots. I feel like, again, Epoch set the standard, but all the one's I've been to seem to have their own self identifying features. If I ever dip into a Starbucks - I've probably got some invasion of the body snatchers going on with me.  Sass and Tea really, though. :)",1
Coffee Shop 28,A quality coffee shop. Their tea selection could be better. This place really shines in comfortable seating.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"I tried to get some late night coffee last weekend while visiting Austin.  Yelp had this place with 4 stars, so I was excited to check it out.  My g/f and I show up about 30 mins prior to closing.  The side door was already locked, so we enter through the patio, where only 2 people were there (using the wifi).  So we go in and the lights are already dimmed and the cashier is coating the cash drawer.  She informs us that we can't but anything because she's already closed out her drawer.  So apparently this place doesn't care about posted times.    From the looks of other bad reviews, this is an issue.  What's going on at this place?  I guess the product is good whenever the staff decided to be open and serve.  So we went to Epoch Coffee - Circa 13.  Place was packed with students and the barista was super nice and laid-back.  Answered all our questions and my g/f believes she might have had the best cappuccino she's ever had.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"19 check-ins Listed in I'm pretty much a coffee shop expert. This is a review that I should have written a long time ago.  I love this place.  The baristas here never seem to be having a bad day, and when they do, they kinda make fun of themselves about it.  I appreciate that from baristas, who, in my experience, ALWAYS HAVE DRAMA GOING ON THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE.  Not so here at Genuine Joes.  They have the best selection of snacks from vegan bakeries in town and I have NEVER had a bad coffee there.   The wifi is also always functioning at a decent speed and I really appreciate the warm atmosphere.  If you're up on Anderson and feel the need for coffee, it would be a mistake to not go to Genuine Joes. Facts from a picture inside Genuine Joe. A great night to be outside on the front patio here.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I've been to Genuine Joe a few times and have had a wonderful experience each time.  The staff is always helpful, efficient and kind.  The Chai is the best I have ever had - I go out of my way to get it because it's so wonderful!  They also have a selection of gluten free cookies and treats, which is great as I don't eat gluten.  And the atmosphere is very Austin - laid back and funky.  I think it's a terrific coffee shop.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Some places make you feel at home right when you walk in. Genuine Joe's did that to me. No one knows my name or my regular order, and the baristas are standard Austin baristas (too cool for school on the surface, actually cool and friendly underneath), but it's such a welcoming environment that I don't care.  I work down the street, and I make the trek over over once a week to read the latest edition of the Chronicle and drink some tea on the patio. Sometimes I choose from their vast selection of Buddha's Brew. Sometimes I try whatever loose tea they've made into an ice version. Sometimes I go crazy and get a chai.  I've never had their coffee because that ain't my jam, but their tea is always good. Baked goods from Russell's, so you know it's legit. No day-old discount basket for the stale ones, but they'll switch it out for a fresh one if you point it out. (Let's get with the times and offer day-olds, guys.)  Check yourself before you wreck yourself in the daycare parking spots. Who knew daycare parking could be so predatory? They'll tow your ass in a flash if you park on their side.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Plenty of open space to work, read, or just lounge around. Whether you prefer a table tucked away in a quiet corner or a big couch to lounge on, you'll find it here. The fact that I don't need to fight for a seat at Genuine Joe will keep me coming back.  I ordered a breve latte, and the foam wasn't as stiff as I prefer, but it was still a fine latte, so I won't hold it against the barista.  There's plenty of parking in the lot behind the store.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I really like this place. Its got the run down coffee shop feel with a wide variety of old chairs and tables. You'll also find several armchairs and sofas to lounge on.  It isn't too crowded whenever I have gone  I really like studying here and there are plenty of outlets against the wall. The volume level is medium to high I would say but of course depends on the time and crowd. There are two rooms that can be reserved for groups at 15 bucks an hour in the form of purchases . When not reserved, people are welcomed to use the area. Because of the rooms there aren't many tables to choose from during busy hours.  I like the staff too. Josh is a good guy and told me about the dirty Chai, espresso and chai, which anyone that likes chai should try.  There is also a nice big parking lot. Be careful not to park in the designated spots for the business next door or your car might get towed.  Overall a good coffee shop in my book.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"2 check-ins This is my third time here, and my friend's favorite place to get some works done. I was told it's usually quiet enough to get works done, and the coffee prices are fair enough for me to come here several times a week.  I like how the table lamp are set up on the bar and plenty of seating, both indoor and outdoor, for you to choose from. If you want even more personal space, there are two separate rooms for you to hide out.  I'm not giving five star because one In s while, you will get groups meet ups, and the rooms will not be available for you. Barstias are usually friendly, but just some happen I met one that's quiet loud for my expectations. In general, one of my favorite places to hang out and get some works done if I'm not in the office.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"72 check-ins Oh man!  Guess where I will be *way* too often!  Fortunately for me they don't open before 7 a.m. so I can't come here before work, but since they are a mere few blocks from my house, I do plan on walking here on the weekends.  Very awesome indoors. Comfy and funky, someone said and  I will agree. Plenty of seating inside and out.  The staff was really friendly and quick. We had muffins and chai tea.  The pumpkin muffin was out of this world fresh and soft, full of pumpkin spices. The chai tasted like the icing of a cinnamon roll, though not quite that sweet, but in other words PERFECT. I like a strong, spicy chai!  Lots of vegan options. They have smoothies too. I'll be coming back and often!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Unfortunately for me, I no longer work near this coffee shop. When I did, I was there every morning preparing for the day with filthy chai.  Staff is awesome, super cool, easygoing and often freaking hilarious.  There's always a great mix of people in and out throughout the day.  I love to support this joint. Anytime I'm in the area and could use a double shot of esp, I swing by and stick for a bit.  Go there. Soy chai with three shots of espresso. Watch out people, I'm driving with this.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Long overdue review. Two words: Best Chai in town! Seriously, the best I've found and I have tried lats and lats everywhere (native accent used for emphasis)....  Central Market makes a good one too but something about the Genuine Joe's version makes me really really happy. Oh, and no, it's not the sugar making me happy - I can't stand much sugar and honestly sometimes will dilute it a bit but it's good all the same. This Chai goes very well with Ben Harper, Franti, Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, or even some Celtic or Reggae music.  Okay, besides the awesome Chai, the decor is neat too (think shaggy vintage) and they change up the mounted art work from time to time and have funky cool music playing. Staff is very diverse and not too hip to be courteous as you sometimes get in Austin. Make sure to check out the mini library too. I'll usually thumb through the Dinosaur or Global Geography book while waiting for my drink :-)  Nice joint! Will definitely recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Call me shortsighted, or gack a social justice warrior but serving Fair Trade - or Equal Exchange or other similar non-exploitative coffee - is something I think an ""genuine"" coffee shop should be invested in.  Does using such beans add to the overall cost, yes and I estimate it at ~$.20.  For anything other than a drip pour this is a small increase of less than 10%.  The same is true of Organic beans.  If you don't care where your beans come from and you put ""genuine"" in your name then why not call yourself Genuinely Evil Coffee.  I think the name would actually garner far more attention than an overly used up punny name, but that's just my take.  Also a coffee house that only stays open until 10pm?  What other businesses are there other than bars, and music venues than coffee shops that still thankfully stay open into the night when temporarily or chronic insomniacs can enjoy themselves?  Having restrictive, and I know there are other coffee shops with even more restrictive, hours isn't good for the community.  The same can be said for the time it opens.  Sometimes I want to get on my bicycle at 5am and I enjoy the idea of being able to not too much after that have a cup of joe, but that isn't what this coffee house is all about.    The coffee house is about the regular Joe that isn't inspired to do much past 10pm, who might take their kids to music or dance lessons but has no artistic, or creative drive of their own, and it's a shame because the aesthetic external shell is indeed as others have commented one of artistic interest.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"Well, I usually like this place but today I went to enjoy a coffee only to take a sip and literally pour it on the sidewalk. Man, I guess it wasn't their day.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!  The coffee  is always perfect. The treats are amazing. The people are so pleasant and so helpful .. The vibe is very relaxed, friendly and it attracts a very nice group of people. I've often managed to get quite a bit of work done, yet I've met three of four very interesting new acquaintances there. I have five different types of coffee drinks I like to order and they are consistently wonderful.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I have to say that this coffee shop is not for everyone.  It's definitely quirky.  However, our group met in their meeting rooms for months, and they were so accepting of us and easy to work with.  Their meeting rooms are great; one of the best options we found for the price.  It is cool because your group members' food and beverages go towards the price of the room!  I loved their huge three way mocha...so fun!  I look back fondly on when our group met there!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Great vibe!! Plenty of room for studying, reading, or whatever suits your fancy! We should all try to support all local coffee shops as opposed to Starbucks. The dirty chai I had at Joe's was the best I've had in awhile. I will definitely be back!!!",1
Coffee Shop 28,Updated review 5 check-ins Very expensive to get a room here. It is fifteen dollars for room or 5 dollars a person. The banana bread is good and the hot cocoa with toffee nut was great. The sandwiches are okay here as well .had to update my review bec they let us use the room for one hour for free.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"As I sit here, enjoying a dirty iced chai latte, it's hard to believe I've never reviewed Genuine Joe (GJ's as my family likes to call it) because I come here all the time. Maybe because I like the fact that it's a chill, non-pretentious place that I don't want to get over-popular. Alas, it has become quite popular, often standing-room only on the weekends. There's nothing particularly special or fancy about GJ's. They make good brewed coffee, espresso drinks, chai's and all the usual coffee shop drinks. They have a nice selection of pastries that I think comes from Russell's. At least, I know their cinnamon rolls come from Russell's because they're awesome. They have breakfast tacos that I think they get from Chapala, though that may have changed. They're fine, pretty fresh if you get them first thing in the morning. The staff are generally very friendly. GJ's is in an old house that is very casual and comfortable. They've put in more tables and chairs, I'm sure due to more people coming in with computers to work. They have plenty of parking. Just don't park at the day care that shares a lot with them because they tow. They have a couple of meeting room areas available for group reservations. GJs is just a nice, comfortable coffee house. My favorite in the area, for sure.",1
Coffee Shop 28,This little coffee shop is super cute! My husband and I stumbled upon it as he was looking for coffee at 8:30pm and all other places were closed. I got a hot chocolate and it was some of the best I've had! I would have loved to try the coffee but will have to wait until next time! He got an americano and said it was pretty good. Service was great. Baked goods looked yummy but didn't try them.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"Came here to study and got an iced americano. I'm not a huge coffee snob, but the drink was very satisfactory and the service was quick. I also had a gluten-free cookie, which was delicious. The wifi connection is solid and easy to access. The music wasn't blaring, which I've noticed is a problem for me in some coffee shops. People weren't super loud and there are plenty of spots to sit inside and out. I'll definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"One of my favorite spots in Austin. Great atmosphere and fantastic coffee. They also have wifi, cozy couches, boardgames, and 2 separate private meeting spaces off the main area.",1
Coffee Shop 28,I went on a Saturday night about 8:00 to get some homework finished. My black ice tea was great! There were about 4 other people in there and two employees.  About 9:00 one of the employees not so discretely dimmed the lights. It was too dark to ready anymore so I stitched to working on my computer. Less than 10 minutes later I was informed by the same employee they would be closing early tonight.  So don't expect to stay until their posted hours. I'll take my business to Starbucks where you don't get kicked out early. And they don't turn the lights down on you.,0
Coffee Shop 28,"Listed in 2014 Yelp Challenge, More For You Disappointing.  I've been a couple times, and was never even remotely impressed. I decided to give it  another shot recently. As usual, the line to order is long and very, very slow. I  ordered two 3 way iced mochas. The order taker/drink maker was incredibly rude.The other employee was making other drinks with a large machine and I could not hear the order taker. She was snooty about it, ""I already answered that question,"" and without even giving me a chance to say what size, she points up above our heads without saying anything. At the end when I was paying she did try to reel in her rudeness by stating that it's loud in there sometimes, with a fake laugh. It was already too late for me. I just wanted to get out of there. If the drinks had been better and more memorable (filled up  halfway with cow milk is not much of a coffee drink, nor did it taste like the 3 types they said it would be), and the service was nicer to non coffee shop types like us, then maybe. Not to mention the  regular size was tiny. I'm all about supporting local business, but if I'm in the area again I'll just go somewhere else, receive better drinks and friendly service. I wish I had something good to say about them, but this place left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"Friendly employees, superb chai, and a relaxing atmosphere. What more could you want?",1
Coffee Shop 28,They have the best Chai Latte I've ever had! And I have had a lot. I don't drink coffee so Chai is my drink of choice and I get it everywhere I go. However they make it here is amazing.,1
Coffee Shop 28,Genuinely GREAT Joe.  A bold - flavored cup of Java in a relaxed vibe spot.  Cool employees.  Be careful where you park.  No coconut milk...sigh...,1
Coffee Shop 28,"It's so nice to have an actual coffee shop as opposed to another *$'s . The coffee is excellent, the pastries are prrdy drn good, and the seating is much more what a coffeeshop should be.",1
Coffee Shop 28,Love this place and the vibe !! the coffee here is the best part...strong and smooth and baristas know what they're doing!! Awesome Austin cafè,1
Coffee Shop 28,"I come here sometimes for letting up with friends and yes, the rooms have a lot of reservations and stuff, but it's 6:33pm on a Thursday and it's not a bad crowd at all. Getting here is kinda weird, as its tiny and hard to see. Great coffee and cappuccinos. Everyone has plenty of room for their laptops and it's pretty quiet unless it's open Mic Night. The parking is bigger, just behind the building. I give 4 stars just bc it's kind of hard to find and the constantly reserved rooms.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"My book club meets here once a month in the front room, which is PERFECT for any kind of small-group meeting. My only (big) complaint is that they use a powdered mix for the chai tea, which means you can't get it without dairy...That's a huge no no, considering Austin has both a huge vegan community, and an abundance of coffee shops where you can get chai made from almond, soy, coconut, or even hemp milk. I usually end up with a brewed tea (made with tea bags, they don't do loose leaf) or just grabbing a Topo Chico from the refrigerated case. A HUGE plus for this place, is that they stock vegan goodies in the bakery case, which I'm happy to pay good money for.  The space is great for reading or working, they have a nice patio, and they have books or games to borrow, which is great. Plenty of parking in the back.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"This place has been mine and my husband's saviour since we had a baby. Only a mile walk from our house, it's perfect to take the cranky newborn in the baby pack and get yourself some much needed refuel juice with as many shots of espresso as you can stomach. I love their tacos too but you gotta get there pretty early to get them usually. The local art they always showcase is awesome, right now it's G2cube and if you haven't seen his work around town you should definitely check it out! Oh yeah did a mention all you can drink drip coffee??? Starving artists heaven.",1

Coffee Shop 28,"2 check-ins I love this place it reminds me of the true Austin vibe , meaning if this is all I did today then it was a freak'n. Awesome day. The service is serene and not pushy pastries are fresh and the atmosphere is almost like being back in the early days of Austin. I truly feel at home here and I hope everyone else does too. Personally I only support local and this L'il coffee house is worthy of Austin's support",1
Coffee Shop 28,"4 check-ins This place feels like in belongs along the streetfront of a little urban neighborhood in Seattle or Portland. This a bit dark inside, the place is covered in quirky decorations. Half the place is working on laptops while the other half chat and read books. It smells like coffee when you walk in and the guy behind the counter happy chats with you as your order.  The fact that it's in between strip-mall-like shops on a busy 4-lane arterial route in Austin makes it all the more special. The coffee is good and locally roasted. The pastries look very good even though I haven't had one yet. While this whole package might only earn 4-stars in the downtown of a more coffee-centric city, further out in Austin this is an easy 5.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"7 check-ins The quintessential uber-local coffee spot.  Plenty of parking, to start.  On the inside, an old house with ample couch and table seating.  Plenty of spaces for small groups, for a pair, and also if you're going solo. It does get crowded, though.  Great, fresh brews.  Friendly and helpful service.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"When I first walked in, I thought this place was too quiet, but then I realized that the group I was going to meet with was in a back room. The cashier was very nice, and she did a great job making the honeynut I ordered! Delicious!  I would definitely come back!",1
Coffee Shop 28,Great place to sit out in the open air deck during the morning or late evening. Customer service rocks at this location and the hours of operation are so convenient to fit anyone's schedule. Keep up the good work!,1
Coffee Shop 28,Love the is place ... This makes me think of what people will remember about Austin ... and what is fast disappearing.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"Great first experience. Quirky and relaxing spot. I ordered a three-way mocha: It was delicious AND came in a mason jar. *squee* Throw in some sweet dudes working the coffee bar, and I'm sold. Had a three-way. Two thumbs up.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Ok. Totally Austin vibe.  Great joe and hip waitstaff.  Cool decor,  especially if you like plastic dinosaurs!   Open mic comedy on Saturday evenings. Family friendly. ..very casual and I the best cappuccino I've had in a long time....maybe ever.  Big mug and handcrafted. ....yummy! The hearth at GJ",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I've been coming here for at least a couple of years - I'm not even sure - and I adore it! The food is yummy, the coffee is delicious, the baristas are lovely, the patio is cute, and it's so nice to chill and study, or just kill time!  They rotate out artwork for sale from (local?) artists, everyone is friendly, and they have a couple of rooms (the Board Room and the Cellar) that you can rent out for meetings, or take over when they aren't reserved at will.  Their drinks are original, cleverly named, and interesting. I haven't had anything I don't like! The food is awesome too and comes from local places.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Perfect place to do homework or just hang out. The environment is amazing - composed of multiple lounges with couches, desks, etc. (really everything a hipster would want in his living room, but in a coffee shop). The coffee and service is great.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I love Genuine Joe's; if I'm meeting someone from up north, I usually go here. Their plush couches and chairs can't be beat, and the fact that they're a member of the AGLCC (Austin Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce) makes it all the more reason why I'd visit.  Staff is friendly and nice; I'm not a coffee-drinker, so I've never had the coffee, but the hot chocolate is so-so. I am a fan of their smoothies; they have one with spirulina that is just great.  I suggest this coffee shop to friends up northish; it's a good one!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"I've been coming to Genuine Joe's for years, and have not had a bad experience yet. It's quirky, fun, and the coffee is good.  Plus, they will make your cappuccino with Almond Milk, which can be difficult to find in Austin. The meeting rooms are pleasant as well. And, from my understanding, if you purchase a coffee during your meeting, the money is credited towards the fee of reserving the meeting room - a win/win for you and the organizer of the meeting.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"4 check-ins Genuine Joe's is a small neighborhoody coffee shop where you can hear a pin drop. I mean, not literally but its SUPER quiet. Don't come here to chat or collaborate unless you can get in the basement room.  I think their prices are a tad steep but I appreciate that they've got delicious diet coke. They're also very creative with their coffee drinks so if you're with a non-coffee drinker, they can usually still get behind a three layer mocha whipped whatnot.  The best part? People there are not posers. Yes, the 80s term but also, no ones trying to be cool to death with wild hair or major BO or big thick glasses reminiscent of buddy holly just because. It's just a bunch of folks, drinkin coffee, doing work and leaving each other alone.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"3 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost, Burnet wins. Genuine Joe is a quaint and cozy coffee shop located on West Anderson.  There's ample parking when you pull into the lot, and the interior is...simple (in a good way).There's a lot of tables, chairs, and couch seating. The furniture looks like it was all claimed for free off of Craigslist. Nothing matches and most of the furniture is different, yet this isn't off-putting at all. Everything just works.  There's a few different rooms and an outdoor patio. The music isn't loud and overbearing. The environment is pretty laid back, and I'd feel comfortable coming here to meet with friends or to get some work done/keep to myself. I felt a little warm when I was here, but it could just be me.  The staff are pretty friendly. They'll carry on a conversation with you as they make your drink, but they aren't going to force anything with you either.They prefer you use card for purchases over $5, but I assume it's perfectly okay to use your card below that amount. GJ offers a 5% discount if you use cash.  The menu offers a diversity of drinks, and the beverages aren't expensive. I enjoyed my chai latte, and I definitely want to come back to try their specialty drinks.  Overall, I enjoyed Genuine Joe. It's a simple, no frills coffee shop that offers great drinks, a pleasing atmosphere, and wi-fi that actually works.",1
Coffee Shop 28,Love this place ! The coffee is always so good! The people always fast and friendly. It s a nice place to relax and read.,1
Coffee Shop 28,"Five starts for the coffee.  Four stars for the atmosphere.  But a couple of one star factors bring the average down to two.  I got a sandwich and a glass of water, in addition to coffee.  The nose-ring lady working there (nothing against nose-rings) forgot the water, and it took forever to get her attention to get it.  No apology for forgetting and making me stand around and wait a few minutes.  Then later (and I am sorry to say this) she was walking around cleaning up and I caught a major whiff of some pretty offensive B.O.  So offensive it lingered for a few minutes afterwards.  I'll still give the place another shot as the coffee is great (I had a 3-way mocha) and I like the atmosphere.  I'll assume chicky just had a rough night which caused her both to not be all there that day and to rush into work without showering first.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"3 check-ins The fact that this place is often crowded, even on weekdays, is a testament to the good coffee. Friendly and funny staff, comfortable environment, and damn good Joe. What else do you need?",1
Coffee Shop 28,"Good and friendly service gets this place 2 stars because the coffee is just poor quality. Subpar beans coming out of a dirty espresso machine never make a good macchiato, but I've never seen a barista spoon in the steamed milk before pulling the shot like they did here! Unfortunately, you'd be better off making your espresso at home...",0
Coffee Shop 28,"I don't write reviews, never have time, but I must say that I won't be going back to GJ's. Tonight I went to meet with a friend and we both felt like they were passive aggressively trying to kick people out. They start ""closing down"" areas inside and outside, meaning turning lamps off, moving chairs and making noise all the while as early as 8:30pm! And they close at 10! An area isn't a room far away, this is the like right next to you. It's annoying and very unfriendly. It happens every time I go within an hour of closing time. Jeez.",0
Coffee Shop 28,"I had the pleasure of quickly stopping in here when I had a few minutes to kill before a meeting. The guy working at the front was very friendly, who I later found out was the owner. The drip coffee I got was also quite delicious. I hope to be in that area again to go back there.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"This spot was a great find thanks to Yelp as they had character and surprisingly good coffee. We found this spot after our coma meal at Torchy's Tacos up the street a bit and really needed a pick me up before the lake.  This location is so unassuming since it kinda is located in the middle of some random plazas which seem to have nothing to do with coffee or anything good ... and its essentially just a house. Once you park and walk in, you see the kitchen area with the coffee counter to order and some nice, worn in couches to relax on. They also have an outdoor area on nicer, less warm days where you can relax with your coffee.  The coolest part is that they have great roasts and they have a ""meeting room"" called the board room. You can call in and reserve this room for a $15 GC to Genuine Joe and have it for a few hours for parties, meetings, whatever you want! Awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 28,"10 check-ins I loved the vibe, reminds me of Hawaii... The parking lot is HUUUUGE ;-) For a Friday evening the place wasn't packed and everybody was trying to stay in the living room ^_^ I will go back I promise",1
Coffee Shop 28,"3 check-ins Anderson might be a fairly large road that runs right past this small coffee shop, but inside you'd never know it. If you need a quiet place to relax, the atmosphere inside is downright funereal. The patrons don't seem unusually meek, so it might be some kind of bizarre psychoacoustic trick - either way, if you want to chat with your bros, you'll be happier doing it outside on the patio.  The main draw for me is bottomless coffee for $3.05. Much as I like places like Epoch, they don't have cheap bottomless coffee, and that can be a dealbreaker on some days. However, their regular coffees are completely serviceable, and you can rock those without regret if you don't have a deadline-induced need to be as maximally caffeinated as possible.  Aside from that, there's enough parking for a coffee shop at least twice as large, and a decent selection of snacks, although they don't have the food that Thunderbird does. Sometimes their wifi is really slow for me though, but the issues usually seems to vanish as soon as it gets noticeable.  All in all a worthy addition to your coffee shop rotation.",1
Coffee Shop 28,"The best way to describe this place is that it doesn't try too hard. Not that it's not trying at all, because it is. Or that it is trying to appear as if it is not trying. That just kind of hurts the head. Rather, it hits the perfect medium. Like Baby Bear's porridge.  In other words, Genuine Joe is laid back and unassuming. None of the furniture matches, but it also doesn't feel consciously eclectic. The staff is friendly, but they don't yell greetings as you enter. Basically, I sat by a window with my coffee and pastry and was comfortable and content.  Also, the first thing I noticed as I walked in was the giant rainbow flag. Gay friendly? Awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Good coffee, decently priced, and lots of options for buying beans. I went with the Las Mingas and have been happily brewing it at home since.  Great space, perfect for socializing, although I hear they do not have wifi here so keep that in mind if you're looking for a place to work remote. Service was really helpful and friendly.  The drip coffee was good and satisfying. Iced latte was a bit disappointing and reminded me of one of those Starbucks iced coffees you buy at the grocery store. Not really a fan.  Overall this is a place I would return, probably if I'm catching up with a friend or to pick up some beans for at home.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Came in here because I had not been properly caffeinated at a nearby brunch spot and because I had heard great things about their cold brew.  Having found not all cold brews are created equally, I have been forced to become a quasi-cold brew snob. That being said the cb here does not disappoint!  Aamof, it is awesome and might just be some of the best in town!  The vibe was very chill (even though I got mine to go) and the barista was so gracious and nice. I love walking into a place and the staff greats you with a genuine smile. It is such a rarity these days that when it happens I can't help but automatically smile back. Instant mood enhancer for sure!  I just wish they had a location up north because my treks down to the southeast side are far and few between, but if and when I am in the vicinity, I will be making detours for their coldbrew!",1
Coffee Shop 15,"This place is in a great area and has the perfect ambiance for a coffee shop. However, the customer service leaves something to be desired. It feels like a chore for the employees to answer a question. I saw someone who was not satisfied with their coffee and even though they offered to remake it, the customer didn't want another cup. They didn't refund the customer and after they criticized the customer in front of well me. It felt like high school. The level of professionalism isn't high for a coffee shop I know but having a little tact is just something that is expected of most grown adults.  They had no pastries and no breakfast tacos when I called ahead and asked. Overall just a poor experience. I'm just disappointed because Cuvée as a company does great stuff for the community. I like their concept just not their coffee shop.",0
Coffee Shop 15,3 check-ins I love this place. Every time I am in Austin I end up here. My love for this coffee is pretty deep. I equate it to liquid silk. During my stay in Austin for ACL I got my caffeine fix here. I ended up getting an east side spice in nitro on two different days as well as the cortado. Both drinks were executed perfectly. The cortado was beautiful to look at with some latte art and was sugar rimmed. The nitro drink was just real pretty on the glass that it's presented.  The ambiance here is pretty chill. People here come in for the morning coffee or just to get work done. There are plenty of outlets and there is also a very pleasant outdoor sitting bar area to enjoy the beautiful Austin weather.  Hubby and I ended up splurging on 4 bags of coffee to take back home to Pittsburgh. I have no doubt I will be back again when I am back to ATX. East side spice cortado,1
Coffee Shop 15,"Updated review Oh Cuvée.  There is still no free wifi. Customers are still on their computers connecting to the Internet via hot spots. The no wifi rule unfairly disadvantages your customers who don't have or can't afford a personal hot spot or using valuable data on their phone.  Thought I doubt that was the company's initial reasoning for not providing free wifi, this is the reality of the result.  The location to order your drink vs pick up your drink is still unnecessarily convoluted and could easily be simplified.  At least the staff was super friendly this time and apologetic about the confusing process. They said it's been an issue since Cuvée opened and they're planning to redo the ordering procession soon.  The coffee is delicious. I wish they'd make some policy changes so I can peacefully enjoy this beautiful, open space!",0
Coffee Shop 15,"Wonderful coffee bar in East Austin. Big open space with a chill vibe. I had a delicious pour over coffee during my visit.  However, I wouldn't recommend the breakfast tacos--tortillas were way soggy from sitting in the warmer.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"I stopped by for the first time recently, and ended up staying for over an hour. The architectural style is ""warehouse."" I loved the little parking lot just for guests, and the long, outdoor patio seating bar, which is perfect on a nice day. Cuvee is located further down Sixth Street on the East Side of downtown and anyone visiting downtown Austin should venture just a little further east to try this cafe, rather than going only to the usual coffee shops close to IH35.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Listed in Texas, 2016 Reviews, ATX, Hangout spots, When in need of caffeine... Cuvée Coffee Bar was one of the places we stopped by to sample the coffee scene in Austin. They were a good choice, as their coffee was very good.  The ambience here is something I like in coffee shops. It is open and aesthetically pleasing. As mentioned, the coffee was good. I tried their nitrogenated coffee even though I am not a big fan of cold coffees. It was better than what I was expecting, and although it is not something I would order regularly (and only because I do not have a taste for cold coffee), I can easily someone who likes their coffee cold falling in love with it.  I will definitely come back for their other offerings. Prepping our drinks Inside Latte See all photos from Clarice O. for Cuvée Coffee Bar",1

They have a bunch of little extras that they throw in to help make your event fun! I have told everyone about this hidden gem! Plus it's a local place and I love that. I kept getting compliments on choosing a cool venue where we could all eat, drink and mingle. Had my Birthday party here and they let us bring in our own treats",1
Coffee Shop 15,Anyone complaining about wifi please delete your post.  You are wasting valuable space for people trying to talk about coffee.  Grow up.  This isn't your office.  No one owes you wifi.  Stop being a shitty customer.  If I've learned anything from working in the service industry it's that the customer is almost always wrong.,1
Coffee Shop 15,"Great spot for early evening coffee/tea.  Not sure what it's like later at night, but I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere from 5-7pm.  Service was great as well.  Look forward to going back sometime.",1

Coffee Shop 15,"Listed in Hello Yelp 100 - it's 2016, My Fix, Second Home Need to unplug? Consider stopping by Cuvee.  I understand that the world needs electronics to get stuff done, but sometimes you just want to get away and read, write, or think without having to reach for your wifi-enabled devices. (If you have a data plan, then...no one's stopping you from that, I suppose)  Their nitro coffee (Black & Blue) is pretty special - it's brewed similarly to Guinness (minus the alcohol), so you get the smoothest, creamiest cup of coffee poured into a beer goblet/chalice.  It's a great introduction to potentially taking your coffee black, although Cuvee offers both milk and simple syrups (brilliant, since table sugar is difficult to dissolve in cold drinks) to temper it.  Also, I have to say that their brand imagery is some of the best I've seen for a local coffee shop - a bright blue motif throughout all of their decor and marketing materials make Cuvee stand out among the local coffee shops.  Tasty coffee, great ambiance, pretty colors - my friend took me here because it's his favorite coffee shop, and now I've become quite partial to Cuvee. Nitro coffee. Goes down silky smooth.",1
Coffee Shop 15,You can find me at Cuvee almost every other morning. They make great coffee and their baristas are awesome. The nitro cold brew (Black and Blue) is the best. We are fortunate to have it on tap at work and it is dangerously good and addicting.   Pro tip: grab a cold brew at Cuvee and then walk over to Counter Cafe East for breakfast on the weekends.  They do NOT however have wifi but people are always there working. I get their stance but would love to have the wifi.,1
Coffee Shop 15,"Service is one of those things that goes unnoticed until it becomes an issue.  I came here after having seeing their cans of coffee all over Austin and hearing that they have good coffee and a cool vibe and environment. This is all true - there is plenty of seating both indoors and out, their coffee is pretty solid, the feel is very trendy, and their baristas double as bartenders serving local beer. They even have free dog treats.  Still, the pretentiousness in tone and body language I was met with when ordering their mill king milk was unacceptable, the barista showing clear annoyance that I had just ordered that without any coffee.  That experience, in addition to the fact that their coffee by itself also isn't the best, leaves me to this rating.",0
Coffee Shop 15,"2 check-ins This is a cute coffee place that serves great cold brew. We went here since they allow dogs to sit on their little outdoor area. Inside, they had an area where you could fill up a water bowl for your dog and treats for dogs too. As for coffee, I got their regular cold brew and it was very good. They also serve Tacodeli breakfast tacos here that are quite amazing. I just got two of their beans and papas (potato) tacos with some salsa. If you like spicy, get the green one. It's really good and taste like spicy avocado. Definitely a great coffee spot that serves great quick breakfast too. Freshly made green tea & Yellow Rose IPA. Dog-friendly outdoor seating. Great cold brew!",1
Coffee Shop 15,"While I get the reasoning behind no wifi, as someone who works remotely it definitely effects my decision on where to get coffee. If they had Wifi, this would be the perfect spot to get some work done.  That aside, what more can you ask for in a coffee shop? They have a great aesthetic, fantastic coffee and beer selections, bright-faced baristas, and Taco Deli!  This is a great place to meet up with a friend or client, grab a pour over for two and enjoy each others company without being tethered to technology.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"5 check-ins Listed in Best of the East Side, Coffee Shops for Writers Cuvee makes the best flat white and other espresso based drinks in Austin. The beans roasted ioff-site are high quality, and the baristas know what they are doing. This is my favorite spot to pick up a coffee on a lazy weekend morning.  Unfortunately no free WiFi, I assume to discourage people like me who want to sit and work on cafes for hours. On a nice day the small patio out front is a great spot to sit and read the newspaper in the sun.  Taco deli tacos sold in the morning.",1
Coffee Shop 15,Pretty GREAT coffee. Check out their cold brew. I also love how they have beers and wines available as well :),1
Coffee Shop 15,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 Unlike the failed HERO ordinance of Houston, Texas, this pro civilization place has unisex bathrooms that don't make you feel like you are being excluded from the inclusivity that you want when in a Venn diagram. Also, when you approach the place from east downtown it's a walking distance from several places including my friend's where I was coming from at the time of this coffee experience.  They have a beautiful patio that has a huge ramp that definitely complies with the ADA. Once you go inside you start to wonder why you didn't sit on the patio but you are now inside and the barista is making coffee and different beverages and you're like wow this is so cool. I mean the barista you can only hope is making coffee if you are at a coffee shop lol. Next we all placed our orders and we had two choices for the coffee beans a. From El Salvador, or b) Ethiopia. I had mine with steamed milk and chose the Ethiopian. They give you different options for milk. I had whole milk.  My coffee was delicious. Unlike the hit or miss consistency of Starbucks, this place delivered everything you imagined them to and then some. We decided to sit indoors and the inside is just as fascinating as the outside. We were sitting away from the barista but we could see that he was very engaging with the patrons at the counter.  If I lived in Austin, this would be my place to go every single day.",1
Coffee Shop 15,Delicious coffee? Check. Nice beer selection? Yup Friendly service? Yes indeed.  What else do you need in a place to grab a morning perk or afternoon pint?  No complaints. Hope to make it out to a pint night there soon.,1
Coffee Shop 15,"Stopped by Cuvée out of curiosity as well as convenience - dropped bf off at work near E 6th/Chicon and have business in East Austin later in morning, so instead of driving back home thought it better to stay in the area. Wrong!  * Service sucks - I'll give the barista credit for saying hello when I walked in (only 2 other customers), but her attitude was cool, distant  * Limited menu - While not much to choose from (and pricy at that), I still had questions; barista answered questions but quickly crossed into patronizing tone  * Doesn't seem to know difference between iced coffee and cold brew coffee - Their idea of cold brew coffee is iced coffee with hip-sounding name ""nitrogenated"" - barista compared it to Guinness nitro (does my face read ""Guinness drinker""?), said process makes it frothier and gave me an unsolicited shot .. no froth and bitter taste! If you have cold brew, say you have cold brew; if you have nitro coffee, say that; but don't say ""no difference"" because there is.  * Atmosphere uninviting; pay station at other end of bar; not enough options for sweeteners  * Did I mention service isn't all that? While barista did say hello, no ""thanks for coming"" ""have a nice day"" etc.  Oh, and I didn't even realize have NO wifi (until after I left) so good thing I didn't stick around.",0

Coffee Shop 15,"Updated review 3 check-ins ROTD I really hate the fact that reviews from people who think every coffee shop should be their own personal workspace are bringing down the overall rating of Cuvée.  They don't have wifi. Deal with it. Who ever said that free wifi at coffee shops should be ""mandatory"" anyway? Cuvée wants to foster an environment for an enjoyable social experience without having everyone stare at their screens.  IMHO, they have some of the best coffee beans in the country!!! Don't let the haters and unrealistic reviews keep you away",1
Coffee Shop 15,I stopped by while waiting for a spot at counter cafe with my friend. The vibe was immediately pretentious with the odd espresso machines and counter layout but I moved past it. I got a *small* iced mocha that rang up over $5!  The drinks are ridiculously priced when the espresso (in my drink and my friends) was clearly low-grade or just pulled terribly because it was very sour. The quality was low for the high prices.,0
Coffee Shop 15,"The vibe was relaxing. The fact that the space opens up to the outdoors is also great on a fair-weathered day. The coffee was also good here - but I wouldn't say that it stands out considering that there's many other coffee shops in town. What makes this place stands out is pretty evident if you do bother going through other Yelpers' reviews - it's the cold-brew, nitrogenated coffee, which I haven't yet tried. And yes, they have this even on tap.  I thought it to be interesting that it had its humble beginnings in Dallas, and then moved shop to Austin. Their product can be found all over Texas in several retail outlets, so good for them.  I'm not much of a fan for the cold-brew but if you or someone you know is a fan of cold-brew, then by all means, do come here. They also serve TacoDeli food, so that's a plus for those who loves the tacos from that local establishment.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"I wanted a nonfat latte, but they didn't have nonfat milk (1% is the lowest they go) so I ended up getting an espresso. I heard a lot of good things about this place and was excited to try some locally roasted coffee, but in the end wasn't impressed. The espresso was pretty thick and dark with earthy tones (good) but quite sour and acidic (bad). I've definitely had better.",0
Coffee Shop 15,Coffee is good and lots of good seating.  No WiFi is annoying and staff could use a bit of an attitude adjustment.  What bothered me the most was that they AUTOMATICALLY add a 20% tip to the POS system.  So if you're not paying attention you will tip regardless of your experience.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  I greatly appreciate good service when I get it.  I get a coffee at another local coffee shop almost daily and ALWAYS tip them.  But they don't just assume I'm going to.  If your employees are that hard up for tips you aren't paying them enough.  I likely won't be back because of this.,0

The only downside is that it's tough to do work here because there is no wifi Black and blue",1
Coffee Shop 15,"3 check-ins I love cuvee coffee roasters and you can find their coffee at many cafes around town.  I am especially in love with their ntiro Black & Blue coffee, which just doesn't taste as good from a can, and is harder to find on tap.  I recently discovered that Black & Blue on tap is unpredictable, which can be the result of many reasons someone was explaining.  However, the place were it is always creamy, frothy, and nutty delicious is at Cuvee Coffee Bar.  Yes, it is a definite trendy hipster hangout spot.  The interior a marriage or clash of metal meets wood.  The bar is located front and center with seating all around.  The front side of the bar is for daytime caffeine addicts, and the backside boozy taps by night.  They have a small pastry selection to chew on.  I love that they partner with Blackbird Bakery for gluten free pastries.  For coffee lovers they have espressos, pour overs, cold brew, and nitro. On the other side, they have draft beers and wine on tap.    It seems like everyone is up in arms about their lack of Wi-Fi.  But, most people nowadays seem to have hot spots on their cell phones.  Austin is full of laptop friendly options, so not sure what all the fuss is about.  If I am out with friends, I am not concerned about my WI-FI availability.

The people who work here are genuinely cool and nice.  Friendly is also a choice I'd select. The coffee is all Cuvee, and they have a variety of drip available each day. Options of milk or substitute available. I love the mocha, but can vary slightly depending on the day. Sit out or in, and dogs enjoy hanging out in front. If hungry, they have tacos from TacoDeli and some pastries, that look delicious.  Taco's run out, so be forewarned.",1
Coffee Shop 15,Canned nitro coffee is what brought me in on a recent visit to Austin. I also ended up getting a to go cup as well. The staff was friendly. The bathrooms are very clean.

Coffee Shop 15,"9 check-ins Cuvée is one of the best roasters in town and their espresso with steamed milk is on point. You can buy their beans and enjoy those at home too...but I've always found my cortado / cappuccino / latte to be especially good when I order at their coffee bar.  For a unique cold coffee, try their nitro version on tap. I personally don't crave it but it's a popular one with the locals...and more and more beyond Austin.  Everybody hatin' because they don't provide wifi but that's not a reason to dock stars on a review if they've made their intentions clear (which they do). Come here with a friend or to read a book. It's a great space with lovely people.  Also, purse hooks.",1

Coffee Shop 15,"Cuvee is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Austin for their nitro cold brew, but I also hired them to cater the coffee every morning for a 3 day conference I held in downtown Austin. The coordinators were extremely helpful throughout the year while I was planning and everything went great the days of the event. Their coffee was still delicious after it had been sitting out for a few hours at our event. My only regret was not hiring them to provide more coffee every afternoon too! I would highly recommend their locations and coffee catering services.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Listed in ShangriLa Le-Dah & other East Side Shenanigans, Life is like a cup of coffee Cuvée Coffee Black & Blue is the best cold brewed coffee I have had. It is the first nitrgonated coffee which gives it a nice thick frothiness. Its rich nutty flavor reminiscent of a porter makes it simply the best.  The custom metal work that makes up the bar, taps and the amazing fixture above the bar was made by Blackwell Welding just outside of Austin. They do espressos, pour overs, have 9 beers on draft and two wines on tap. The space is awesome and they can boast having one of the top baristas Lorenzo Perkins on their team. The one thing they don't have is WiFi (by design). Luckily most cell phones can be turned into a WiFi hot spot if you need to get some work done. Cuvée's Black & Blue cold brew",1

Coffee Shop 15,"Crowlers!!! Like growlers, but so much better - 32 ounce cans of the beer of your choice, filled and sealed on the spot. Probably the only place in South Texas that utilizes crowlers, and the beers on tap from which to choose, while few in number, are fantastico enough to be worthy of crowlering (like, for instance Austin Beerworks Sputnik)... Be still my heart!  So now, on our weekend Austin beer runs, I can get my Cuvee Black & Blue coffee fix at Jester King brewery, and my stouty beer fix at Cuvee Coffee... topsy turvy love affair.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Made a trip to Austin and am glad I stopped by here. Someone from Spider House said this place served what nitro coffee should be.

Coffee Shop 15,"Listed in Spawn Friendly, Old Yelper, new gluten intolerance., I'll sleep when I'm dead. I can't figure out what there is to complain about at this friendly little spot. The people who work there are obviously proud of their products, and are never less that delightful to me, even when I have a screechy 5 year old in tow. They make my daughter lovely little hot chocolates with hearts on top, and I get a freaking fantastic latte made with the smoothest coffee in town and the highest quality milk. I also tried one of their seasonal drinks soley because it was named ""Son of a Nutcracker!"" and it was fantastic. Just mildly sweet and perfectly spiced. Added bonus: gluten free ""pop tarts"" which are really puff pastry filled with jam and topped with icing. For the gluten deprived among us, that s*** is like finding the holy grail of pastry paired with the best coffee in town. Go.",1
Coffee Shop 15,A coffee shop with no wifi. Seriously?,0
Coffee Shop 15,"Cuvee is a wonderful place to enjoy some of the best coffee that Austin has to offer with a friend. Take heed that this is not a place to come and work on your laptop all day. There's no WiFi. As a result, you usually see people here talking and enjoying each other's company. I appreciate that because I've been to too many places where every table is occupied by someone at a laptop, working silently, and it almost feels out of place to have a conversation. I don't know when cafes became synonymous with free WiFi, but it's kind of ridiculous. I don't think people would complain that a nice restaurant doesn't have free WiFi. Cuvee is selling excellent coffee, not WiFi with a side of coffee. You have many other options in the area if you just want to work and drink coffee.  Cuvee's coffee is excellent. They also serve a good selection of beer and a bit of food from local places. Cuvee is a great local roaster and you can be confident that you're tasting a well-roasted coffee, whatever type you get. Nothing charred or baked. There are lots of good local roasters, but Cuvee is a sure bet. If you brew at home you'll want to try their beans. I usually get a pour-over but their espresso is great too.  I'd recommend trying their black and blue nitrogenated coffee, a pour-over, some kind of espresso drink, and maybe a beer if you're still standing. You could then grab something to eat next door at Counter Cafe and maybe have a walk around the area.",1

Great staff working there, both nice to talk to and extremely knowledgeable about coffee. They have coffee the usual ways, that you would expect in coffee shops. They have specific blends for specific purposes. They also have pour over coffee which I usually get, because its the best way to drink coffee. They also have beer and nitro cold brew on tap.

Coffee Shop 15,"Stopped in for lunch, was in the area and curious what was inside. It's definitely a coffee bar and specialize in a nitrogen cold coffee, I didn't have any but a lot of people were ordering it.

Here's the weird part, ordered 2 sandwiches (pre made and nothing special), hummus in a togo container and 2 drinks and it was 26.50! I was like WHAT, not sure how much everything costs bc they list ""market value"" on most of the items.  Atmosphere was cool, I guess its a good place to stop for a coffee break, just bring your Amex Gold Card.",0
Coffee Shop 15,"I ordered a cortado at Cuvée this morning.  It wasn't on the menu but they were happy to make it for me anyway.  They were out of the usual glasses so they served it in a cappuccino cup, which was fine.  The coffee was good.  They had a small selection of pastries at the register.  My bran muffin was good and plenty big.  The staff were all friendly.  They serve beer and wine later in the day.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Ok,  where do I start with this place.   It's not hard to run a coffee shop.  There are basically 3 steps:   Have coffee,  have internet and be open.    Here is how they performed:   They have coffee - it meets expectations Have internet:  no Be open:  ya,  and parking is ok.    Other notables:   No internet,  really?   I mean,  this has to be purposeful.  Internet access is so widely available,  someone here made the conscience decision to say  "" naa,  lets NOT make internet available to customers""   WTF ?!     Ok i get it,  you want to be the super trendy east side coffee shop that plays obscure hipster music and people sit around next to the post office with their labradoodle and talk about instagram and how much they liked Bernie Sanders in 2004.  But its too loud in here for that.   WAY too loud.  I have my custom ear plugs in right now and can very clearly make out the music.    Also when I was there last - a fly was seriously harassing me.   And sure, flies exist - but it was annoying.",0

Try the black and blue on nitro (also available in cans) and definitely partake in some of their baked goods, the croissant was better than a local bakery.  One pleasant surprise, was sparkling water that came with the espresso. This little touch lent  an authentic Italian feel, which I couldn't find elsewhere in the city.

I loved there retro signage on the building and there painint on the wall both very unique.  I also tried some of there breakfast tacos. They were good in hurry. They arent made to order so they are sitting in foil. Still warm but you can tell they have been sitting for a little bit.  But its a coffee shop not a breakfast joint.  They do have three kinds of salsa and those were all very tasty.  Lastly they have both beer on tap, it was to early for that and there very on canned cold brew. I grabbed one of those for the road.   Ill update later on that experience.  This by far the best coffee I had whike i was visiting Austin. Espresso w milk also known as a cappuccino. Retro signage. Love it.",1

The draft beer, friendly service, and Kosmic Kombucha in stock are also major draws for me.

I'd say it's best for happy hours or evening events (like the surprisingly fun barista competitions they sometimes host). Christine and Libby behind the counter",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Updated review 2 check-ins Coffee shops on this side of town are getting more and more crowded. Seating, parking and a backed-up queue at the register are common place.

Staff was super friendly and espresso was on point. Definitely adding this spot to my rotation on the way to work.  Update: I just realized this place doesn't have wifi.

Coffee Shop 15,"I arrived in Austin around 11:30 PM on Thursday evening, Friday morning I needed my coffee. After having breakfast tacos, I Yelped and found Cuvee to be nearby as I was staying with a friend in East Austin. It was hot and muggy out and all I wanted was straight iced/cold brew coffee and to my surprise they have a Black & Blue which is nitrogenated cold coffee. Being from Los Angeles and been to Seattle and Portland multiple times I've had Stumptown's cold brew and cold brew on nitro, so I thought I'd give it a try to see how it compared. I got a large Black & Blue, it was refreshingly cool, nice and strong and very very smooth. I can't say that I like Stumptown or Cuvee more but both establishments make a pretty mean nitro cold brew coffee. The inside of Cuvee looks pretty modern and had a painted walk, they serve their coffee on tap and they serve alcohol on tap also. I also found out that Cuvee is one of the bigger suppliers of coffee in Austin. When I'm in Austin, I will definitely come back to Cuvee for my coffee fix, and if it's not as hot I'd like to try something else. They also have canned Black & Blue but I totally forgot to pick couple of them up on my way out, I don't know of anyone else who cans nitro cold brew coffee so that's pretty unique.

Coffee Shop 15,"2 check-ins People who don't understand the negative reviews weren't served by the young lady that took my order on (10/28/14) at noon and it wasn't Becca. I walked in and wasn't greeted (already sized up by girl), okay that's kinda typical Austin, I let a nice couple go in front of me so I could study the menu. The rude girl's attitude completely changed with them and was all smiles and giggles, explaining in detail the espressos for the day and asked for a preference. I walk up, she had this look like ""oh it's you again"" and wasn't forthcoming with my questions, I ordered espressos with milk and she didn't bother to ask me what type I wanted like she did the previous couple. It's an awkward set up, walk in, place order and travel to the end of the bar to pay. There was absolutely no technique in how the milk was placed in my espresso just a big PLOP, I found that absurd since Cuvée offers a ""Milk Science Lab"" at their Austin headquarters. I'm not looking for a design either, I want to know that I'm getting a professionally made beverage. The cashier even mentioned that the CEO was in the building, why would this employee be behaving in this manner if the owner was in shop? I sat at the bar area and overheard ""rude girl"" say that if they aren't busy they could go sit down and drink/eat whatever, she did. Lounging on the job is just not cool.  After finishing my beverage, I purchased another 4oz espresso made by Becca, she was nice but I had to initiate a simple hello and introduction. Technique was still lacking.  The coffee is exceptional and I'm actually obsessed with it, five star coffee all the way!  I'm completely in love with their San Jose Ocaña and Reserva, try them! I loved the layout of the place and I probably would have enjoyed it better if it weren't for a weak and dismissive employee.  Read Alanna J's review, we more than likely had the same girl. Just like Ayesha G. said, ""this place isn't very inviting."" Perhaps if you cut out the attitude and incorporate some genuinely nice customer service this place will thrive. Espresso was killer, customer service needs major work. Reserva espresso 4oz & 12oz(with vanilla)",0

They treat their coffee as a craft! I started by trying three of their beers on tap. I had Austin Beerworks' Sputnik, Blue Owl Brewery's Dapper Devil, and 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op's Supernaut on Nitro. I'm glad I asked for a recommendation from the barista because the Supernaut was hands down my favorite! The nitro just adds a creaminess to the beer that you can't beat. Each beer was really good in it's own way. Dapper Devil is one I would really enjoy drinking in the summer. It's a sour ale made with raspberries and I like the tart flavor of it.  The staff was super friendly and willing to give me recommendations on what I ordering (aka also knowledgeable)! I ordered a pour over to go with the Cuberow (Ethiopian) beans. It was smooth and a little earthy (in a good way)! I noticed they had some gluten-free pastries. Ended up snagging two GF poptarts to go! So glad I stopped in again. I wish there was one up north!  This isn't a place to go if you're in a hurry. It's all about slowing down and savoring what you're drinking. They care about what they're making there. There's no WIFI but that actually got me to talk to the guy who sat next to me. Turns out we're both coffee enthusiasts and I walked away with some great recommendations.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Definitely loving the vibe from this place. Very state of the art coffee brewing. And it's all home based! Perfectly timed pour over coffee and in built counter espresso machines. And I had to try the coffee that everyone raves about, nitrogenated cold brew. Very tasty and very refreshing. Beer on tap and canning available as well.  Small parking, but more along the side of the building and the street. Inside seating with high and low tops, seating around the bar, and patio outside seating.  Love the two baristas that were working today. Very helpful, knowledgeable, and funny.  Awesome concept and awesome place. Pour over and a cold brew over ice",1
Coffee Shop 15,Listed in Pour Overs VERY GOOD Pour Over. Well made in a laid back setting,1
Coffee Shop 15,Three words: Nitro Iced Coffee!  I don't give a flip whether they have wifi or not - and it *does* say No Wifi in block letters on the front door.  They have Nitro Iced Coffee!  And I didn't have to drive to South/West Austin to find it either.  Yay!!!,1
Coffee Shop 15,"Good coffee but way over priced. The employees should smile more. And the suggested tipping with the their tablet just makes checking out akward, especially when the barista is more concerned about whos texting her than the quality of my 7 dollar coffee. They should hire better employees and pay them more.",0
Coffee Shop 15,"I don't understand the negative reviews. I agree that the price is a bit high but if you compare it to any other third wave coffee shop in Austin like Houndstooth or Brew and Brew, that's what you get.  This place has the best cold brew in town! It's hard for me to order anything else because I don't wanna miss out on the cold brew on tap. The scones that they have  are also delicious, super buttery and soft. The staff is also friendly. I've sat at the bar a couple of times and just talked to the cashier.  I'm glad there's no wifi. Be IRL (in real life) people! You come here to talk to people in the community or to meet up friends, not to seclude yourself behind a computer screen. The cool decor is not meant for that. It's meant to socialize.  Anyhow, I heart this place. Hope they do well.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"The cold brew at Cuvée is simply some of the best in town. It comes out of the tap like a fizzy beer, and I love it.  The decor inside is amazing and rustic.  The baristas are friendly and knowledgable.  The seating promotes chatting with your neighbors and I am always a fan of meeting my community over a cup of Joe.  Only complaint is that there is no Wifi.  While I understand that this promotes socializing, I need my Wifi!",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Coffee is great but the second I made the mistake of asking if they had wifi, which I understand. However, I was ""blacklisted"" and all of the staff treated me differently. They quickly changed from warm and friendly to ""I can't believe you just asked that"".  Within 30 seconds of getting my drink at the bar the cashier asked me if I wanted to pay for that and close out, I had actually planned on having food and maybe more coffee but since you asked and you're all being rude I decided to close out.  If you want to cultivate a social crowd there, don't make me feel like you're trying to get rid of me.  Work on the customer service, please. Clearly I'm not the only one who had a negative experience with the staff. There are plenty of great warm friendly coffee shops around town that are using Cuvée beans and making BETTER drinks.  Good thing they have the distribution going for them, because a coffee shop with crappy customer relations couldn't survive in this town otherwise.",0
Coffee Shop 15,I don't typically like iced coffee but I really like it here! I love the easiness and their patio seating for my people -watching-habit!,1
Coffee Shop 15,3 check-ins Very impressed. The nitro coffee was great. Very smooth. Good location and great space to hangout. The staff is personable. Greeted right when you walked in. Ordered was taken with in minutes and paid for and was able to enjoy. Very good place for coffee. Worth the drive or what not to have the nitro coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 15,"We go to the Counter Cafe & have to wait,  so we go to Cuvee next door, usually getting a pastry appetizer. If you order a latte,  mocha or other specialty coffee,  it's good. ...BUT it's SUPER expensive and today I ordered a decaf cup of coffee.  They had to brew it, so I was expecting a rich cup of fresh coffee.  When it came,  it tasted like brown water. Very weak. I get that I'm not the ""in crowd"" because caffeine doesn't like me, but paying that much,  either make it a good experience or DON'T serve decaf.  Also,  they HAVE NO INTERNET access.   :(",0
Coffee Shop 15,"Slowly working my way through Austin coffee spots... I suspect this is as good as it gets. I can only speak for the Americano I ordered, but It was clear that the baristas, coffee, and machines are in sync which resulted in a wonderfully tasting cup. I'll be back for more.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Coffee was great, baristas served good quality drinks. Recommend stocking up with their coffee beans! Mocha Latte",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Stumbled upon this place while waiting for a table at the restaurant next door.  This place has no frills coffee at very reasonable prices, but the real star was the cold nitrogenated coffee. This nitrogen infused coffee is less bitter than typical cold brewed coffee and was super creamy. Also, really strong which is a bonus! If you're not in the mood for coffee, they have a decent selection of beer and wine, just walk around the bar to see the menu.  I'm not in the area too often, but it was definitely worth the trip. Cold Nitrogenated coffee",1
Coffee Shop 15,"Awesome little coffee shop/bar. Have 5-6 taps with usually a great spread of craft beer. The nitro iced coffee is amazing and they'll even add some to the nitro beer they have on tap, this is a must! The staff is friendly and very helpful. I will absolutely return.",1
Coffee Shop 15,"What's not to love? Wonderful coffee, wonderful staff, and it's Austin through and through.  Don't expect to be able to work solo here unless you have a hot spot. 5 stars for a small group hang and the coffee if you're just swinging by for it.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"This is a quintessential south austin coffee house. Anyone from Austin knows exactly what I mean. When you walk inside to order the aroma of their coffees instantly put you at ease. Plenty of seating outside, but somewhat limited inside. Staff was nice & efficient. The traffic flow of getting our orders was a distorted & seemed to add unneeded wait times. Overall I'd recommend this for coffee or beer",1
Coffee Shop 54,A great coffee (and wine and beer) bar. Starbucks has nothing on this awesome original place. Very crowded - always. Great vibe and great drinks. Free wifi,1
Coffee Shop 54,LOVED this spot in Austin! We stopped by for breakfast and coffee one morning - and it did not disappoint.  The coffee was DELICIOUS - really well brewed and fresh.  They have a number of food trucks out in the back - but be warned - the lines and wait can get long if you get here at peak breakfast / brunch hour.  The tacos were DELICIOUS though - and the granola and yogurt I got from the African food truck was honestly the best yogurt and granola I have ever had.  The tables outside are a great place to hang out and enjoy your morning - and there is a flea market on weekends!  Have a lot of love for this place - I'll be back if we swing through Austin again.,1
Coffee Shop 54,"Walking in the parking lot at first it's a bit odd to distinguish where the coffee shop is. They have a cute little patio that is dimly lit and very relaxing. As you walk in there is a food truck with awesome food and then to your left the coffee shop. It's really nice in there it was about to close, but they had a lot of seating and lots of cool drinks including alcohol. It's open late so it's a nice place to go and have some drinks or coffee with friends or even a casual date night. My Carmel Latte was to die for and my other half's Dirty Chai was on point. They also had a Zucchini bread that caught my eye as we were about to pay and of course I had to try it. Well it was delicious, probably about the best piece of bread I've had in my life, and trust me I've tried a lot. If you are in Austin stop by it's really unique and quite relaxing! Best Bread Evaaaa!!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"5 check-ins Listed in Let's get a Drink in Austin Radio has turned into one of my favorite places in South Austin to stop in for a drink or food.  It helps that one of my favorite food trailers is on their property - Cazamance!    They serve coffee and beer and other random drinks.  They have nice local beer which make my husband and I happy.  They also have a variety of different teas, which makes me even happier!  I love their iced hibiscus tea!  It's about $2 and change and you get a free refill.  Not bad at all.    Radio has plenty of seating inside and lots of covered seating outside.  Some evenings they have live local musicians playing which is a blast too.  I have been here for lunch, dinner and after hours and been pleased every time!  Radio will continue to be one of my favorite South Austin stops. Habiscus iced tea Turkish mint hot tea and a chocolate chip cookie",1
Coffee Shop 54,"2 check-ins Let me preface, I hate South Austin.  I really loathe driving there but love people and places down here.  If I go south of the river, I really REALLY like you.  Like, for real.  That said, I've been to Radio twice now and the first time I was stoked to get cold brew on tap but was not impressed with their terrible parking situation.  Fast forward a year or two and they have that parking situation remedied.  This last time I got a chai and was totally stoked on it.  The spice and flavors were on point but my only gripe (this is probably a novice complaint) was that it wasn't sweet at all. That's OK though, I got some simple syrup and fixed that shizz.  The interior was also quiet and chill.  I almost felt uncomfortable having a conversation about life happenings because it was just quiet.  Then it happened....I heard Kid Rock and two Nickelback songs.  WHY RADIO WHY!?  I get it that Trump got elected but WHYYYYYYY?",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Lots of outdoor seating with a couple food trucks on the lot. One is called Cazamance and is African cuisine, another is Veracruz Mexican. Indoor seating available too. They play music both outdoor and indoor at a medium level, not too loud. Great place for meeting friends and they have a wide variety of coffee and beer. Stumptown coffee roasters Three food trucks here today! It's definitely the hot spot for the weekend.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Radio is so superbly casual that you feel like you could walk in in loafers and code away. Their beer selection is local, fun, and not too pricey. And if you're looking for something a little bit more caffeinated, their coffee is well-balanced: not all the rage, but on the mark for nice sippables for the long haul. We love to hunker down here and get some work done among the cover music playing on the stereos (enjoy in good weather outside). Their picnic tables are the ripe location for last minute hangout with friends and the next-door taco truck makes Radio an excellent late dinner spot as well. Radio equals chill, work, hang, repeat; definitely a neighborhood regular pit stop, check it out!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"9 check-ins Wins: - Great selections of beer, wine, coffee, etc. - Two very tasty food trucks on site (Cazamance & Veracruz All Natural) - Welcoming vibe - Good people watching - Dog friendly patio  Opportunities: - Parking can be challenging - If you arrive at peak time, it can be difficult to find a seat  BLUF: A great place to get a coffee or a beer while visiting with friends when you are in the Ben White/Manchaca area.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"This is my coffee joint! I bring my laptop here and grab an Americano or a latte (3-5 bucks depending) Good prices, friendly staff, never had an issue getting a table inside. Great beer selection and has Veracrus tacos and free WiFi in the afternoon",1
Coffee Shop 54,I just don't get it. It's ridiculously loud. Kids running around everywhere. Picnic tables in dirt. And literally the worst chai latte in the world. It taste like dish water. Why not go to a bar if you want beer? I've tried three times. Are we this desperate for a place to hang out? I'm giving it two stars instead off one because they carry Moonlight Bakery. Even the breakfast tacos from the food truck are mediocre. I truly wonder how many of the five star reviewers even hang out here still?,0
Coffee Shop 54,This place is why people go to Starbucks.  No wifi on weekends?  No rhyme or reason to how to order?  Very very very very terrible.,0
Coffee Shop 54,"This place has an amazing atmosphere.  Came here the other night to hang out for a friend's birthday and to grab some drinks.  Unfortunately it was about to rain, so we decided to hang out inside but the outdoor space looked like so much fun.  They have lots of covered seating and food trucks every night - definitely want to sit out there at some point during the summer!  The inside was not disappointing by any means.  They had a great live band that brought in a great audience.  The music was awesome and was not too loud to have a conversation. I bet they have great bands all the time here.  Oh and the best part is that they have Left Hand Milk Stout on Nitro! It was like having an adult milk shake - so creamy!!  I'd definitely recommend this place to hang out with friends - it's a bit dodgy to find parking but after you get over that hurdle it's smooth sailing from there!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Cool place for coffee or beer. Would rate higher but they turn off the wifi at 5.. may as well turn off the lights too if they want customers to leave so bad. Ohh and I'm pretty sure they do not have AC.  Hopefully management changes some things, would make for a great establishment if they fixed the above.",0
Coffee Shop 54,"9 check-ins My absolute favorite place to grab a capucino and a beer at the same time. Easily the best patio for a coffee/bar combo. I usually come around 11am, so I am always undecided whether to get a 512 or coffee, so I end up getting both. Working as a nurse at night, I don't feel any shame in this.  So, let's talk about the man buns. This is a hot Austin spot with lots of prime time Austin people watching. You will not be diasappointed. This is where I learned about men with man buns and the new trend...braids. And of course, there are lots of beards and women who look like the 60s never went away.  Last thing, fun dogs to look at. Dog friendly is a major plus!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"This place is so awesome. Great, large outdoor space that is beautiful - lots of plants and sun. They have great beer and coffee too, with live music. Their indoor space is pretty small though and crowds up fast (usually after 9:30am), so get there early if you want a seat inside.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Added parking, thank God, and the coffee and baked goods are always good. I don't extend that to the pizza reheating they did in their early days, as I was food poisoned from that once, but I'm not sure they do that anymore. They may have had that not work out for other people as well.  It's about 50/50 on finding somewhere to sit, you may end up getting your coffee to go.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"2 check-ins Awesome service, awesome menu... Just awesome. This place is great for a drink and or coffee. Has indoor and great outdoor seating. Pet friendly. The aftermath. Sorry all, couldn't wait.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I love this place. Chai tea is phenomenal, the place is comfortable, the food trucks in the back are great and the pastries are super tasty. The beer list is good and the staff are friendly. I could hang here every single day and never get bored.  Brew & Brew would normally be my go-to but it's more than twice as far as Radio. Parking can be a challenge, but that's city life. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  The people who come here are pretty chill, which makes it easy to look forward to returning. Chai tea latte with almond milk",1
Coffee Shop 54,"5 check-ins I've lost my edge. I've become a hermit, and even more bitter. bet you didn't think that was even possible.  when I first began going to Radio, me and my fellow chef boys would get day drunk after a long shift. we would laugh and be rowdy and they would harass pretty girls. it was a special time.  now, I sit alone, with a beer, and judge everyone. silently, now. the beautiful young woman, sitting on the grass, doing yoga. wtf. yoga? do that shit at home.  maybe that ol' neckbeard in the corner. what's he browsing on his macbook? porn, I hope.  or that new mama, with her tiny baby in a classic moby wrap sling. she got her figure back the day after giving birth to her new baby. fuck you.  oh, look at that smiley toddler, walking around, learning about the world, and grass, and butterflies and dumb shit. annoying.  radio is full of beautiful and interesting people. great coffee, delicious beer, amazing food trucks, and then there's me, all drunk and angry in the corner.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I'm in love. It's so perfect. In every way ;)  First of all, there is plenty of seating inside and outside and you can even just bring a blanket and sit on the grass...with your dog. Like the good old days.  Second, they have equally good coffee and equally good beer. It's a rare occasion I drink coffee past noon, but I needed it. Had an iced mocha with almond milk, delish.  Decided to order a healthy taco from the food truck, Veracruz which was also delish (smart move, guys). Read my review on that one, next ;-)  I played some musical chairs in different areas outside until fellow Yelper Benigno A. arrived. We ordered some beers (Live Oak, a fave) and briefly watched a band play, which was excellent.  Everyone was so laid back and relaxed. An all-around great place. You won't be bored here...it has everything you need! :)",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Updated review 198 check-ins More parking added! Just behind the coyote mural. Great coffee. Super staff. Quiet in the mornings until around 8:45. I love that it's an old house, and how can you beat a place that you can both start and end you day? Events after hours from live music to movies and trivia night. Did I mention a great happy hour?!?",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Had this little gem coffee shop bookmarked for months and months. I thought parking onsite would be very little and crammed and it was.  Nightmare parking unless you don't mind parking offsite and walking is a major deterrent, because the chai tea lattes I got were bad and expensive I would have to say just don't.  Starbucks shouldn't be better, but it is. I'm so saddened to even say that. I wanted to like this place. It looks so hip which is probably why parking is a nightmare lots of the clientele were hipsters having beard measuring contests or asking what is the most vegan drink.",0
Coffee Shop 54,Veracruz Taco Truck - delicioso salsas                                        Cozumel Curry Truck - healthful fabulous flavor for all kinds Basically always happy to visit Radio. See someone ya know Tasty beers / coffee /wine Apple commercial inside 3 separate outdoor spaces Always chat with others at the picnic tables Hipster service Weekly events Its legit Vegan curry wrap dales pale ale veracruz salsa 512 IPA,1
Coffee Shop 54,Great stop for anyone who likes coffee or beer. Pretty great atmosphere as long as you don't mind bringing some noise canceling headphones for your laptop. Potentially a great place to meet people or meet with people!  Cortado is smooth and silky. Highly recommend. Fancy Friday afternoon at Radio. Great craft list and the coffee is great too!,1
Coffee Shop 54,"This is the best spot on the south side. They have weekly movie nights, music, a giant beautiful courtyard, good drinks, and great food. I HIGHLY recommend trying the food truck in the courtyard called Cazamance. It is SUCH good African food, and vegan tip: they've got great options. High five!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"2 check-ins Oh Radio tell me everything you know. I will believe your every word you tell me so.  This place is trendy! I love bar, coffee shop combos. What Radio lacks in parking spots, they make up in seating. There's so many places to sit, have a drink, and catch up with friends. There's a food truck  that looked okay. The ambiance was very enjoyable. I can see this being a popular first date place.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"This place is great.  We go almost every Monday for Bluegrass night. There's lots of outdoor seating at tables, or bring a blanket like we do and watch the music picnic style. Radio has a great selection of beer, and let's not forget that Veracruz tacos are legit if you get hungry. Being so dog friendly is also a big plus. We are lucky enough to live within walking distance and bring our pup here weekly.  Be warned, like others have said, that their WIFI shuts off at 5pm and on weekends. It's only annoying if you don't know about it. Otherwise, there are plenty of other coffee shops to get work done after hours. As a small business, Radio can set whatever rules they want, and I respect that.  There is extra parking behind Radio, off Manchaca. We can usually always score a spot in the back if the front is full (which it usually is).  We haven't been to any of their other weekly events (they also host Trivia night and movie night), but it's definitely on our list.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"One of the classiest coffee places in the city - hands down.  The coffee itself is outstanding.  Many places when they offer a ""premium custom gourmet special"" espresso -  what is often offered is an indifferent not-worth-it coffee.  (This means you, Houndstooth.)  Here, the premium beans are worth it and they are expertly brewed.  The location is spectacular.  Everyone hangs around outside like they do at the Draught House Pub -  But the outdoor setup is much nicer than that at the Draught House Pub  (More greenery, more room, more space, heaters)  Two excellent food trailers don't exactly hurt the outdoor ambience.  Indoors there is a ton of room and a lot of seats. Big tables to work at and the chairs are actually comfortable. Decorating is dark but with fine windows to bring in the light.  One quirk. They only have internet monday thru friday bankers hours.  They do coffee by day and beer by night and weekends. (although both are available at all times)  But they really take seriously the idea of work 9-5, play nights and weekends.  I was there on a weekend afternoon and there were plenty of tables with some people drinking coffee and others drinking beer.  (A few people were drinking both. Hey, keep Austin Weird.)  I did not need internet this visit, but normally no internet is a deal breaker for me.  However, I have gotten so used to the internet cutting out from overuse at prime office coffee houses - that I now travel with my own MyFi just on general principles.  So Radio can't stop me from using the internet!!!!  BWAH HA HA HA HA!!!!!  (Maniacal laughter followed by a wild eyed impersonation of a mad scientist in the movies.)  The bottom line here is that the quirky internet policies here are not a problem.  That opens up Radio's other serious positives as something to be taken seriously.  The crowd is massively cool.  Both the coffee menu and the beer menus are first rate.  The food trailers are a great addition.  The physical ambience can't be beat.  And the place has plenty of room.  So what more do you want?  A great place to both work and play.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Yeah, I like it. Came here to meet some friends and actually enjoyed it. Love the food trailers here and the place is nicely done. Parking is a bitch and a half, but you know, growth in Austin!  Come and hang out at the picnic tables, there's lots of them. Bring a dog, but on leash please. Have a beer you think is Shiner, but is really a delicious 90 shillings creation. Enjoy the company and chill atmosphere. Done and done. Like it. We'll be back.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Stopped in here for a cup of coffee and was hoping for a dessert.  My wife got a hazelnut latte and I got a cold brew.  We both thought our coffees were great.  The only thing missing, really nothing to offer for dessert or a pastry.  Now if they could get a dessert food truck to park in the back, this would be a spot we would frequent more regularly. Cold brew coffee",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Easily the best, most unique coffee shop I've been to.  The coffee is fine.  I'm not here for the coffee.  It's a bonus but id rather have a mimosa or taco.  It's way too fun and vibey to be a boring coffee shop.  It's always a mixed bag here and my go to spot for business, hungover , and mom meetings .  Try the tacos or a mimosa, if you haven't heard.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I came here for the first time this week. During the day, it was great! The baristas/bartenders were super friendly. I had Veracruz tacos for lunch (so freaking good) and beer to get me through my afternoon workload. It is REALLY noisy all the time, so make sure you bring noise canceling headphones if you're not the type who functions best in loud places. I was planning on staying through the evening, then found out they turn off the wifi at 5pm. I suppose they think they're driving out squatters, but it's really annoying to people who actually pay for food and drinks, then realize that being there is a waste of time.  However, now that I think of it, this may be a good place to come when I want to make some art without the internet to distract me. So I guess it's not so bad ;)",1
Coffee Shop 54,"This is a great place to go with friends. Delicious coffee. Minus a star because they stop the wifi after 5 pm on weekdays. On weekends, there is no internet connection at all.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Coffee shop, bar, music venue, this place is worth checking out. They serve Stumptown coffee, so that should make any coffee hipster happy. The place is pretty large and has a great patio section. They cover it to keep the elements out so you should be fine most any time of the year.  The VeraCruz taco trailer is right outside too so you can hangout for a few hours and get work done. The staff is super friendly as are the patrons. I find it easy to just start up a conversation with people here.  Once nighttime hits, the WiFi turns off and it becomes a bar with live music. Their beer selection is pretty legit I must say. A lot of craft and local breweries are represented here. Would be great for a laid back date night.  The only major downside is the parking. Place is popular, the lot is small, and that area is challenging for street parking. Otherwise, pretty awesome place!",1
Coffee Shop 54,Coffee and beer are two things that make any work week better. It's hard to review this place without taking into consideration the amazing food truck on their property!  I was impressed with the amount of beers on tap including my favorite blue owl! They even had many different varieties from the various craft breweries.  Inside is small and dark but there are so many picnic tables for seating outside! Its an easy place to meet up to chat with friends.  I'll have to go back soon to check out their movie nights. They had school of rock playing when I left!,1
Coffee Shop 54,"Radio is a solid spot for a cup of coffee when you want to hang out in the afternoon breeze.  The coffee shop boasts great coffee, craft beer, and kombucha on tap. I like to post up with a drink and soak up the sun--the large open area seating outside is perfect. They have two food trucks (tacos and African cuisine) to satisfy any food cravings, though the wait can be lengthy. They recently added more parking in the back to alleviate the past parking issues. Prices are reasonable for coffee and while there can be a line, it usually moves pretty quickly. Sometimes Radio feels a little too cool for school, and not super welcoming, but the staff are helpful enough.  My only real complaint is they turn the Wi-Fi off in the evening. I understand they're trying to change the atmosphere at night into more of a bar with music, but it just relocates me to another coffee shop. Overall, either during the week or the weekend, when I'm looking for a great outdoor patio, Radio is high on my list.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Super hip. I do love Radio, but it's the kind of place that people dress up and go to be seen. And when I say dress up, I mean dress up so perfectly that no one knows you don't always roll out of bed looking as cool as you do when you come here. The parking is usually a nightmare and finding a seat is a challenge too. HOWEVER, the staff is friendly, the coffee is great and this is a great place to meet a friend or client. This is not a laid back coffee shop, but rather a perfectly curated Austin social spot.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I wish my stars could go higher than a 5, becuase this place is a solid 10. Radio opened shortly after my husband and I moved to ATX and it soon became our ""spot."" The people of Radio have become our great friends and always have treated us like family. Tane is nothing but a ray of sunshine, we ALWAYS look for her beautiful face! The fun is always unlimited when we're here. Great beer, trivia, movies, bands, and more.  ALSO!! The tacos at Veracruz are a bonus, hands down the best you will ever eat. I almost want to keep this place a secret.  :)",1
Coffee Shop 54,"13 check-ins Great cafe/bar spot. Awesome neighborhood vibe, especially on Bluegrass Mondays which is a total scene. They have all types of nifty, trendy coffees and beers on tap and brew. I just wish they had hard alcohol! The ambiance inside is a study chill vibe whereas outside you have picnic tables, lawn and food trucks. I guess it's kind of a something for everyone type of place..... Unless your something is booze. Lots of hot guys too, should I add a star for that?",1
Coffee Shop 54,"3 check-ins Best Caramel Latte in town!    In the evenings, there's a younger guy who has a totally cool curly haired mo-hawk thing going on.  He is the one you want to make your latte.  I have no idea what he does to make it so creamy and flavorful, but when you only allow yourself one coffee a week you are very picky about the where, when, who of it all.    So let me tell you...IT IS WORTH IT!    I tip him almost the full price of the latte itself and refuse to let anyone else make it except him.  Others have tried, he's the winner every time.  Only reason it's not 5 stars... - parking stinks, - no gluten free options for someone who is required to be G free, and - the mosquitoes are awful since all of the rain.  Oh, if you need internet any other time other than from 8-5, M-F, it is not available.  I get why they do it, but that can be stinky when you really want to study after work yet you don't want to go home.  But who wants a wet blanket around?!  So, go try it out and do so on Monday when the regular band is there and people watch and pet some dogs.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Loved the atmosphere here! I stopped here for breakfast and coffee (two days in a row because i liked it so much) while in the area for the weekend. The vibe is really young and fresh but, welcoming to young families with it's outdoor seating and space to hang around. The food trucks outside are convenient and give it the authentic Austin feel.  I tried the nitro (basically a cold brew coffee that tastes like guinness's coffee sister) the first day and a latte the second day. I enjoyed both a lot - I was really hoping for a traditional iced coffee the first day but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the nitro.  My one caveat about the place is definitely that the line can become massively long. Waves of people come in on the weekends so be sure to leave yourself some time!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Delicious beer and I fell in love with the courtyard and the lil foodtrucks they have. Outside...under the tent...by the food trucks, lovely",1
Coffee Shop 54,"They have cold brew on tap! And vegan baked goods. And there is ample outdoor seating and food trucks! What's not to like? Oh right, the parking. It can get pretty bad and sometimes you'll drive around for 30 minutes looking for a spot and then just give up and go to Wheatsville for coffee. They have added additional parking behind the businesses next door, but those are often full, too. Once you make it into a parking spot, Radio is a great spot to hang out- which is what people do, hence the lack of parking openings.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Awesome coffee shop with a huge, lovely courtyard. I had a delicious spicy chai and enjoyed sipping it leisurely outside.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Nothing exciting.  Just a typical coffee bar. The lack of parking is a huge turnoff. The food trucks are alright, but again nothing screams amazing.  Yeah they might have beer but I will enjoy one at home.",0
Coffee Shop 54,Great coffee in a relaxing environment. Very zen* every time I'm in ATX I go out of my way to come here. Love it. Great coffee,1
Coffee Shop 54,Really cool concept. They serve both coffee and beer and have two food trucks out back for your taco fix. I love  the outside seating area and the bar area inside. It's very busy and lines are a thing BUT not bad. The kombucha is amazing and the coffee as well. They have a large beer selection and super friendly staff. Definitely come here for a Sunday Funday or to meet up with friends. They also have live music at night. I highly recommend this place. I wish they had places like this back on the East coast.,1
Coffee Shop 54,"2 check-ins Nice, mellow coffee shop/bar.  I came here a couple of times during my trip. They have plenty of seating inside and out. Service were was great and prompt. I also like that they serve Stumptown coffee.  Would defintely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Found this coffee shop on a whim last week, and fell in love with it. We came at night and it had such a nice Austin ambience to it, with lights strung around its patio and a great throwback soundtrack. There's plenty of seating outside, but it's more limited inside.  They also had a live band playing inside, which was neat. We didn't get to hear them since we were enjoying the night air outside, but they have little events or activities every night.  I got their hot chocolate and it was delicious. Wouldn't say it's the best since trying this amazing place in Chicago, but it was a good cup and warmed the night.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Updated review 3 check-ins I was fixin to write a complainey review about how I'm consistently frustrated by the parking here.  This fact remains true, but I've shifted course.  Instead I'm going to write a review about the friendly staff. I just had a particularly lovely interaction with a sweetheart barista who kindly asked me how my morning has been. When I told her honestly it was pretty crappy, she told me a cute story and cheered me up. She also wished me a better day in a way that felt sincere, and it totally changed my outlook.  I got an awesome coffee and a pep talk for about $5. Thank you, red head barista with the bangs! You exemplify what I think are important qualities in this line of work.  Beyond great coffee and kind people, Radio has a very welcoming atmosphere inside and out. There are both communal tables and smaller ones for individuals or pairs. They have several delicious food trucks stationed outside, an herb an veggie garden and a fire pit. The place almost feels a bit like a ski lodge, save for being at the intersection of two highly trafficked roads. But from the interior of the courtyard or sitting in one of the comfy leather couches inside, it hardly feels like a roadside stop. It's quiet and calming.  Radio also has some great programming in the evening. Several of my local musician friends have played here and they have a calendar of movies and other fun stuff. My kind of place!",1
Coffee Shop 54,Beer happy hour was great- enjoyed my Pilsner. But I wish wifi doesn't get cut off at 5pm. Great atmosphere as well,1
Coffee Shop 54,"This is located on the other side of town from where I live, but it was worth the trip. Love the outdoor patio area as well as the indoor space.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"LOVE RADIO! why you ask? awesome coffee, hubs loves the cold brew, Veracruz tacos, dog friendly, covered patio, AND awesome chocolate croissants. Deliciousness all around and super laid back. One time veracruz told us it'd be a 45 min wait for the tacos we ordered. But they are worth it. Iced tea, cold brew, brisket quesadilla, chocolate croissant, annd tacos.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I love the atmosphere, the coffee, and the food! I wish it was closer to my neck of the woods; I'd go more often. There are usually a few dogs and kiddos here too, and it can be pretty loud if you're trying to work here. Good for a hangout with a friend, but not for in-depth working or meetings.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Radio is such a great south ATX nook with a chill ambiance and good tunes! The food truck options are spectacular and their kombucha on tap is a must! Great for afternoon tea pots and lattes under the trees solo or with friends. All good things here- treat yourself to this radness and... Enjoy! :-) ps- heads up no wifi on Monday during bluegrass night- so you can leave the computers at da-Casa :-) To ""tea-ly"" an ATX fave! Radio is greatness and they offer a variety of everything yummy!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I'm so late to this party it's not even fashionable.. but holy coffee, this place is uhmazing. I hosted a little work from home party here, fingers crossed that the space would be conducive to said WFH. It was perfect - not only for some internetting but also for anything you'd like.  Their craft beer selection, great coffee, lightning fast wifi and partnership with Veracruz tacos makes this a great spot to do a bit of work or go on a date, meet with friends or play some board games. It's beautiful, functional and the baristas are (get this!) actually really nice.  The parking is kind of a pain but if you're not there during peak times, you should be fine. Note: They do turn off the wifi at 5pm so don't plan to camp out Bennu-style after that time.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"110 check-ins I love this place, and I love that it's only a short walk away. Their iced chai tea lattes are my absolute favorite, I would drink one everyday if I could. The chai lattes I used to get all the time at Starbucks are now too sweet to me. Oh well.  The atmosphere here is great although it can get pretty crowded inside since everyone is trying to escape the death heat outside. At night it's not as bad, of course. The Veracruz taco truck out front alone would keep me coming back to this place. Service can be pretty inattentive, but the staff is usually nice. At the bar Front view of the sign best chai tea ever",1
Coffee Shop 54,"So I've just returned to Austin after 6 months abroad, and I'm cranky I have to drive everywhere after living in walkable cities and even crankier there's no coffee shop within walking distance of where I live. I tried going to Bouldin Creek but there was nowhere to park and remembered a friend had told me Radio was a cool joint, and it was close and even closer to home, so I drove on down.  Found parking even though it was clearly insanely busy at 2pm on a Sunday. Couldn't find a table inside, so I decided to sit outside at a picnic table under the cozy warm heaters protected by the wind by plastic walls, but then I realize I need to go inside to the counter to order and notice a table had opened up. Score.  I sit down, only I'm in front of the window that has no blinds and I can't see my laptop monitor and there's nowhere to charge my laptop. I move to the only other place to sit which is a chair that has an electrical outlet behind it. Fantastic. I plug in and go to the counter to order my Americano and sit back down. I couldn't locate wifi, so I go wait in line to ask about it.  I'm told there's no wifi on weekends, but normally there's no password and I'd be able to easily connect.  There's no wifi on weekends. Unbelievable. I asked for a to go cup and took myself to the Austin Public Library.",0
Coffee Shop 54,"A+ coffee, A+ service. I went in around 8 am on a Saturday morning and was promptly greeted and had a delicious coffee in my hand in less than 10 minutes.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I really liked this coffee shop--they made a great latte and had whole milk and almond milk to choose from. The coffee was smooth and really tasty. My two friends and I stopped here to grab coffees then sit outside at picnic tables and have breakfast tacos from the excellent Veracruz. There was a covered area and an open area (for sun lovers and sun haters, equal opportunity), and another non-taco truck (that I didn't try). It was chill, I noticed the beer on tap for something other than breakfast, and it was a fun space to sit outside and start the day.",1
Coffee Shop 54,I love Radio Coffee! They serve coffee on tap which I think is really cool! They also serve Vera Cruz tacos (best tacos in Austin!) right outside their coffee shop. I had their iced hibiscus tea and also their vanilla latte. The latte was just ok but the environment makes up for it!,1
Coffee Shop 54,"Great spot! I swung by during a work trip and ordered an iced chai which had a nice amount of spice and later, a local Pale Ale. The place is laid back with plenty of room to work or hang out. I can see how parking could be an issue",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Solid espresso, comfortable atmosphere, fun patio and live music. The taco truck there isn't great. Overpriced and very slow service. Our order of 4 tacos took over an hour.",1
Coffee Shop 54,They have a great selection of beer and have a pretty hip place to hangout. The bartenders/baristas are too cool for their customers though. I realized it late but I should have begun by saying how cool they are and how grateful I am that they are giving me good coffee and beer. I might have a gotten a better service then.. maybe.,0
Coffee Shop 54,2 check-ins Great coffee-beer place in Austin. Convenient for me other than parking. Great staff and nice indoor and outdoor area for hanging out. Some good food options make it a relaxing place to come with some good options.,1
Coffee Shop 54,"Love the beer selection. In particular, love that they carry Blue Owl sour mashes. So good! The kombucha is fantastic.  Great vibe. Dog friendly, and there's plenty of ground space where you can throw down a blanket for music nights. Really like this scene. Very Austin-esque.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Updated review Still not great coffee and I hate their lazy curb cuts that grab my bike tires but the outside space and food trailers are awesome.  Nice wine options.  I hear the beer taps get a lot of kudos. It is much better for happy hour than as a coffee place.  Another update:  still trying to like Radio but they make it so hard.  It is proof of ""location location location"" as the key to success. Every few months I swear to give up on the luke warm coffee and uninterested hipsters who serve it.  If only we could get a better place nearby.",0
Coffee Shop 54,"Radio is my favorite coffee shop in Austin. I love the decor, vibe, coffee, my favorite taco truck in town and their wide variety of entertainment and events they have on their calendar. Radio is great to hang out with your dog, family, a first date or to work remotely from.  The stumptown cold brew is expensive but my favorite coffee treat in town.  Did I mention they sell Rose out of a can? Love Radio Coffee & Beer, so happy it's in South Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Good coffee but FYI they turn off their wifi connection at 5 pm which is pretty annoying. So if you need to work or do school work, don't go here after 5. They said they do that because ""it's more of a bar at night""",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I LOVE this place. The tacos, the coffee the Kombucha on tap, and the ciders. Both the food trucks are a must and the environment is unmatched.  Beware, if you are going there to get work done and need wifi it gets turned off at 5pm.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"This is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin!!!! I was super stoked to see that they were building a coffee shop in south Austin, but I wondered, how will it measure up? Well, its measurements so happen to be through the ROOF! First of all, the name is perfect. I love the radio and everything about it. I love talking on a radio. I love radio signals and antenna. Last but not least, radiohead Is one of my top favorite bands and honestly changed my life. So the name Radio is special to me, and their sign is tight!!!! There are so many amazing qualities about this place ... Where do I begin? The coffee is powerful. It will wake you up!!! The baristas are very skilled at making artistic designs on the lattes. Speaking of the baristas, they are all so friendly and pretty hilarious. They make going there a lot of fun. I enjoy their tea selection and they serve it to you in the cutest tea pot! : } their desserts are off the chain too. Tuesday nights are vinyl night. You can bring your favorite vinyl, and they'll play it for you. My favorite was when someone brought in Harvest by Neil Young. When it's not record night, these folks bring it with the music selection!!!! They play anything from Gorillaz to Daft Punk to Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats to Tame Impala to some underground Houston hip hop. I spent many months studying for the MCAT there very regularly. It was an awesome study spot because many people study and do work there. But don't be fooled, there is also lots of room to party there too. It's the best of both worlds. The food is fabulous. I adore the fish tacos from the Vera Cruz food truck. The art on the walls are so spectacular and dreamy. The bathrooms are always clean and the soap smells fantastic. All in all, my memories at Radio are special. I met many people there and also ran into old friends.  P.S. I did well on my MCAT and got accepted to medical school! Thanks for being there for me, Radio.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"2 check-ins So I only come for the latte but it is the best latte I've had, I think, ever. Terrible parking but great lattes.  Later Edit: they have added more offsite parking but I haven't had a chance to check it out yet.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"3 check-ins ROTD Listed in My reviews of the day Space: The building and the outside patios (and lights) are all beautiful and well constructed. It's very modern and it's not a converted strip mall, like Strange Brew down the street. The space is clean, well-designed, and in a part of town that is starving for coffee shops. There are flowers and actual landscaping, etc.  Food: There's a Vera Cruz taco truck with some of the best tacos in Austin right in the parking lot, and they serve East Side Pies pizza inside by the slice until it runs out. I tried the migas tacos and really liked them.    Coffee: There are lots of coffees (draft coffee!) and beers, and I look forward to coming back. It's less down and out than Strange Brew, which seems to have switched gears to live music, which is fine.  Noise: The outdoor music was a little loud, as was the construction noise happening around us at 2:00 on a Saturday. But I went the first week and I'm sure these issues have all resolved themselves now.  Issues: The only issues are 1) the parking. There seem to have been lots of complaints about that already. 2) good space for the kids. There are lots of families visiting, and so it would be neat to have a little slide or toy area or something that more and more places have these days.  The spot sort of reminds me of the Thunderbird on Manor Road. I would recommend it to anyone, and look forward to going back. Veracruz Tacos",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Coffee is pretty good and good beer list. The taco truck and wraps outside are really good. Great Patio and inside.  Now, why 2 stars? The baristas are really pretentious. I'll walk up to order and they act as if you're interrupting them. If you ask for things they'll do it with a shrug. Sometimes they'll stare at you for few seconds then maybe take your order or talk to the other barista. This happens all the time and if you're a frequent customer there then you know. I've bussed my own table multiple times and the baristas hand you a towel so you can do it yourself. Customer service is terrible.  Why do I keep going? I think it's like an abusive relationship. You get treated like shit and you always go back.",0
Coffee Shop 54,I love this place. Really beautiful atmosphere both outside and inside. Great selection of drafts. They have cool events all the time....went for trivia on Tuesday and it was a blast. I also went to their vintage pop up market and got a ton of great stuff. I love that you can grab food from the food trucks outside too.,1
Coffee Shop 54,"I wish this place was closer to our apartment!  A laid back atmosphere coupled with an extensive craft beer selection, well made coffees, and a large (and for the most part covered) outdoor space makes this our new coffee spot of choice! Lots of large tables outside would make this a nice spot for a small group.  The crowd was constant as expected for a late Saturday morning but it never felt overcrowded and service was quick.  Every sip of the Nitro cold brew coffee on tap is worth the $4 price tag, and my wife had to conscientiously pace herself taking down her latte because it was so good.  We'll definitely be back for one of their comedy nights or to check out some live music. Not a bad way to start our Saturday!",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I came here for the first time today. I had a frozen coffee and it was hella tasty. There is plenty of outside seating, some covered and some not, so I was able to bring the dog I am dog sitting. There were some food trucks and lots of vendors, super Austin-y things like soap and such. The only reason I am docking a star is parking. There are about ten parking spaces in the actual lot and the street parking is nonexistent since it is right in a residential neighborhood. On Saturdays and evenings, it seems you can park at the tire place next door but that was only about five additional spots. I don't know if I would go out of my way to come here, especially since I am not about that parking struggle life.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"I enjoyed this place! I can see how it would be cool in the evenings grabbing a beer. I came in the morning for coffee, and it was crowded, even on a Thursday. I luckily got a spot right as someone was pulling out of it, but I can see how parking would be tough if there are no spots in the lot available. I ordered an iced almond milk latte, which was pretty good. After about 15 minutes it tasted a little watered down though - I like bigger ice cubes that don't melt as quickly. I also ordered an apple fritter from their pastry case, which was SOOO good. Next time I'll ask them to warm it up a little! overall, a cool vibe and good coffee. wish it was closer to where I live but it works when I want to get it of my area a little more.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"If you feel like winging a night out-Radio Coffee and Bar is a cool place to check out on a Friday Night.  It has everything from a chill atmosphere, awesome patio seating, live band and hula-hoops!  Yes-I said hula-hoops.  This trendy bar that is located within blocks of family neighborhoods-literally was a diamond in the rough.  Seeing how laid back the atmosphere was made it really inviting.  With the chill outdoor seating area, this is a great place for a group of friends to meet up and catch up on the weeks events.  There is also a taco truck located out back-havent had their tacos yet, but plan on checking it out the next time I visit.  Inside has an elegant feel.  All drink items are listed on the chalk board behind back.  Great selection, that highlights the best beers in Austin and around the area.  If you are not craving a beer-they have a decent coffee and tea selection that pair up great with the yummy desserts.    I honestly think this place is a good place to grab a beer and chill with friends.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience and would definitely come back again.",1
Coffee Shop 54,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" It would never occur to me to combine a genuine coffeehouse with a hip beer place - I'm seeing a lot of these lately - but if it's working, cool. At 1:30 in the afternoon on opening day, half of us here were doing coffee, and the other half doing craft beers. I'm pretty sure they were craft beers.  Think Buzz Mill plunked on Manchaca, with less flannel and Veracruz All Natural instead of Blue Ox. The parking lot is geometrically interesting, they're still tweaking the large outside patio area, and I think this is going to be one popular place. I am slightly discomfited when I see children having a grand old time inside a beer tap environment, but they're your kids, not mine. Whatevs.  Radio was doing a killer drip Stumptown from Portland at $2 a pop, with fifty-cent refills. I could camp on that stuff all day. The barista guy was getting a serious workout, and so was the guy pulling beer. They had slices from East Side Pies at the counter. Opening day buzz is always exciting, but I also think Radio needs just a little time to settle in, and literally let some grass grow around the place. And then we can all settle down as they become the next South Austin icon. Mmmm, delicious hipster beer here! Okay, I think this is delicious hipster beer being served here...",1
Coffee Shop 54,Cute place. Great service and excellent espresso! I guess other people know too because parking was a little difficult but not too bad. I will be coming back to try out their beer.,1
Coffee Shop 54,"I have been coming to Radio on the weekends for quite a while to work and just found out today that they stopped their wifi on the weekends too. Of course after paying for a taco and a coffee. I get the wifi stopping at 5pm during the week, but weekends??",0
Coffee Shop 54,"3 check-ins What a great place to have within walking distance of our digs. I feel like this place is going to become a regular stop for us. I mean, what more could you want? It's a coffee and beer bar!  Here are the things I love: Great coffee and an impressive beer selection. The bartenders/baristas actually care about the drinks they're making and take pride in their work. There are clearly regulars here, and the staff knows who they are, what they like, and a bit about them. The kombucha on tap is a new addition, but every flavor I've tried has been delicious. They'll fill a growler for you, and it's only $15. The atmosphere is very cool, and there is plenty of seating (indoor and out).  Here's what I don't love (and there's not much): Don't expect to get any work done here -- it's always really noisy. The wifi cuts off at 5 p.m. I found the cold brew on tap a little weak, but the flavor was good nonetheless.  Seriously, check this place out! There's a reason it's always busy!",1
Coffee Shop 54,This place was so good. Coffee was delicious. It was nice to sit outdoors and relax and enjoy a late night cup of great coffee. Will be back for sure.,1
Coffee Shop 54,"4 check-ins What isn't there to love about this place?  The only thing I can think of is that it isn't located closer to North Austin.  Thankfully it isn't ""too"" far to get here from my dog's southerly located groomer.  I will drive the extra few minutes further past my former  coffee wait spot to head here.  It's just that good and everyone else knows it too. Just a few months old, and yet it had an endless line of patrons waiting to order drinks throughout my several hour stay here.    This is no shabby coffee shack. As you drive up the first goal is to just find a parking spot. While there is a small parking lot, I never once saw a free spot, and down the road the neighborhood street was completely full.  They have a great well kept up outdoor seating area, with a Veracruz Natural food truck serving up fresh tacos. Inside is inviting in wood tones, but not upscale modern.  The staff are super friendly and talkative.  The next goal is to find a place to sit, their are plenty of outlets for your computer along the wall, but not many smaller tables, you might need to ask a neighbor to share something.  They should invest in some outlets along the bar.  They offer a variety of eating options: pastries, pharmacy café gluten free pastries (the ones wrapped in plastic), Veracruz Natural Tacos, or East Side pies.  They have a great beer selection well paired with their amazing Stumptown coffee.  It's not surprising that the owner while a native Texan, spent sometime amongst the coffee gurus in my hometown Seattle.  It's like bringing the best of both worlds to Austin.  I couldn't believe they even served the Stumptown nitro draft style right next to it's neighboring beer friends.  After some of that, I am forever ruined.  I can't have Stumptown cold brew any other way now. They even had some decent loose leaf teas that they served to you in a tea kettle.  Just go up front to check out the plastic menu's off to the side at the cash register too order, and wait for your order before sitting down.  Rare to say you have a favorite coffee - beer joint. Wow..actually ventured to try something other than Stumptown nitro coffee - the cappuccino was delicious! Nitro Stumptown Cold Brew w/ Zucchini Gluten Free Bread from Peoples Pharmacy. See all photos from Mindy H. for Radio Coffee & Beer",1
Coffee Shop 54,"Won't be going back.  I'm a block away and I use their place for many of my meetings.  The coffee is awful but the convenience has always been the reason I go.  The atmosphere has been pretty good as well.  For some reason, they had an entire section of their yard closed today.  Every table in the place was occupied. My client and I sat at the only table that offered any privacy for our meeting.  Word of advice to the dude in the orange, unkempt beard.  When all of your tables are full, don't act like an ass to the people who are sitting at a picnic table in your completely empty section. I won't be back, I won't promote your business to my clients and when YOUR customers leave their cars in my parking lot, they will be towed.  I'm hoping it's a really nice car I get to have hauled out of here. You sir are an awful neighbor.",0
Coffee Shop 54,Austin's own 512 Pecan Porter with a shot of espresso and chocolate in a cool almost cabin like atmosphere with super nice service and Veracruz tacos outside. Need I say more?,1
Coffee Shop 54,"6 check-ins Anyone who brews Stumptown is fine in my book. Radio even seems like the kind of hipster coffee joint you would find in Portland, minus the awesome tacos. No one does tacos like Veracruz.  It's a great setting as you can choose between sitting inside at the polished, wooden bar, lounging on lawn chairs outside with your dog, or sitting with a group at the benches near the food truck. You will see lots of Macbook Pros, beards, and plaid at this casual hangout. Service is friendly and pretty quick despite their using post-it notes for order taking.  The worst (and best) part of Radio is that you have to decide between breakfast tacos or Eastside Pies. But technically, you could just eat both. It's an easy place to stay awhile and make the seamless transition from coffee to beer or beer to coffee. Your choice. They've even got cold brew and kombucha on tap. Yep- South Austin just got more awesome. Interior",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Fair trade coffee, large area with lots of seating, a yummy iced honey cream latte (my personal fave drink here!)- what's not to love?!  One star down b/c their baristas as mentioned in many of the previous reviews aren't the friendliest in town **more like downright cold**but WHATEVS, still comin' back!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I came in here not expecting much out of it.   I am one of those weird people that likes their frozen coffee to not taste like coffee.  However I left this place wishing I had known about this delicious little treasure before.  I ordered a Frojoe Mocha... and it was the best Frappe I have ever ordered.  Usually when I go to small coffee places like these the Frappe taste exactly like their coffee counterparts except frozen.  This was not like that at all, it was absolutely delicious.    I would say better than Starbucks. If they had one in Fort Worth I would come here every morning for coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I have been going to to this coffee shop every once in a while for 5 years now. I have never been disappointed with the friendly staff, light-hearted music, comfortable atmosphere, and the absolutely delicious coffee, lattes, tacos, and empanadas.  Favorites: Large space: you are never having to sit at a table crammed next to a long line of people waiting for coffee Honey Nut Latte: mmmmm ""Good Coffee for a Good Cause"": Coffee is fair traded, and the sale of beans benefits students in The Dominican Republic.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I've seen this place and heard about it for a while but never tried it. When I walked In I expected it to be really empty for some reason but it was actually really busy. There seemed to be a lot plugs, lots of lappy action. My drink (dirty chai fro joe) was pretty meh. I tried the hurbs and his was pretty meh too. It tasted cheap. Like a mix between gas station and starbucks make it at home instant coffee. So if I want a place to plug jn or sit and chat I might, maybe come back. Maybe. But not in a million years for the coffee itself. Plah *gag* I think I'll stick to my houndstooth and epoch. Stick to what I know is gewd fro-joe dirty chai",0
Coffee Shop 17,"If this rating was just based off from the drinks, I would give Dominican Joe 3 stars. But I decided to add another because they have lots of outlets, tables, and fast wifi!  I ordered the popular drink, honey cream latte. Now I came around 3:30 on a Thursday and they weren't really busy. I usually expect some sort of latte art work because I mean, who wouldn't want to have a nice looking latte and show it off cause aesthetically it looks awesome? Unfortunately mine turned out to be a heart-like blob :( The drink itself was honey sweet, and by that I mean not super sweet but subtle enough to balance out a regular latte. It was okay though. My friend ordered their limeade and it was really refreshing. Not as sour as a lemonade, but not super sweet either.  The outside of the building would be great for a photo op. If you were to just look at the exterior, you'd think this would be a more upscale coffee shop. But the interior says so otherwise. Its more on the shabby side (not that its a bad thing), and a local artist happened to stop by to hang up his paintings!    Its a great study spot, which was why I came today. Plenty of outlets along the walls, so if you're not sitting against the wall then bring an extension cord for your laptop. Wifi is also pretty fast here. Wasn't super crowded from 3:30-7:30. Will be coming back! Okay not shitty....but really wanted something cool though :(",1
Coffee Shop 17,"3 check-ins One of my favorite study spots! It's super chill and laid back, nothing too fancy or grandiose, and pretty small on the noise level. The coffee is a bit on the darker side and the sandwiches aren't too bad! Parking is abundant and not that bad of a drive from campus! I think the best part though is the mission of it all! With every purchase, Dominican Joe's gives back a portion to the impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic! What a great cause and great way to give back, sip some hot coffee, and ace that exam!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Dear Dominican Joe -  Thanks for providing a convenient location for my early morning coffee meet-up with an old friend.  You were a 10 minute walk from my hotel and seemed to have a decent vibe going on with so many people (regulars perhaps?) working on their computers when I arrived.  The wait for my americano was longer than I'd expect, and it wasn't worth it.  I realize the coffee is fair trade, but it wasn't good... I hate to admit it, but I ended up throwing out half of my cup... it didn't have much flavor.  There isn't a huge selection of food at this place either.  With so many coffee / cafe options in Austin, I'd seek out my cup of joe elsewhere next time.  I'd say ""it's not you, it's me,"" but... it is you.  Sorry!",0
Coffee Shop 17,"I love studying here. There are a lot of tables inside (unoccupied is another thing), and outside seating is nice when the weather is good.  Not sure about their drinks as a whole, but I love the flan latte! So tasty. flan latte! So pretty",1
Coffee Shop 17,2 check-ins I live on riverside and this is my go to coffee spot in Austin! It's always painless to park which is why I also love the location. My favorite is their iced coffee! I get it weekly along with my Taco Deli migas breakfast taco with doña salsa. Everyone that works here is beyond accommodating and the one time I had an issue with a very burnt taco they refunded me immediately. The only wish I have is that they order more migas tacos because 50% of the time it's a crap shoot if they'll still be available when I come!,1
Coffee Shop 17,"52 check-ins Have you ever had coffee that was perfectly roasted, had the perfect slight bitter note, but was chock full of roasty, toasty, nutty flavor? Oh you haven't? That's why you're reading this review? That's perfect! You should go to Dominican Joe's!  I'm not a caffeine junkie. I'm a coffee taster. I LOVE the taste of coffee. I drink it so my mouth can be happy and my nerves can be a wreck! However, with such good coffee, it's worth it!  Their coffee is organic and each cup helps the world. I'm all about that! To top it off, the staff is delightful! Each worker has their own personality, and each experience is better than the last! The vibe is also very relaxed. Come here to do interviews, study, get some work done, or play some games!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"The absolute best thing about this place is that it is LARGE. There are plenty of tables and space and outlets and all the things you need to get your work done. Austin is filled with tiny tiny coffee shops with no parking and no space to work. It's so frustrating to get in there and realize you have to leave!  So, that is the #1 reason Dominican Joe is awesome. So much space. I was there in the afternoon on a weekday, so that was my experience.  My coffee was good. It's really a nice little shopping center very centrally located. It was nice to be able to walk right over to Wells Fargo to get my other work errands finished too.  I also really liked the music. Great music.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I stumbled into this very interesting littke spot right off Congress Street in Austin.   Very good coffee, free trade I believe and very homey atmosphere.  I have my laptop to finalize a couple of presentations and I have found this peaceful spot. I am also having two of their large empanadas wuth so great hot sauce.  I recommend the Spinach and Mushroom. Patio here. Very pleasant",1
Coffee Shop 17,"25 check-ins Love my DoJo. Also right across from my current client, this is my afternoon (and sometime morning) pick-me-up. I'm usually just an iced coffee kind of guy, but every once in awhile, I'll dig into one of their lattes. They've got Tacodeli tacos in the morning, which is so clutch, and sometimes they have these homemade peanut butter cups that are delightful and not too rich. The staff are all super cool. Just nice, friendly folks trying to get caffeine into your system with as little hassle as possible. Outstanding. So if I don't wear pants, I get free coffee refills? Score!",1
Coffee Shop 17,5 check-ins The honey almond latte is still my favorite coffee anywhere.  Any time I'm downtown it is tough for me to pass up  stopping in for some coffee.  I also tried their cold brew which I think they call iced toddy and it was also great.  The staff is also always extremely friendly and willing to offer advice if you are unsure what to get. Honey cream latte and a chaipuccino Chaippucino Busy tonight See all photos from Charles Y. for Dominican Joe,1
Coffee Shop 17,"Saturday, 3:00 PM.  Quickie: - Drink quality + Friendly staff - Cleanliness - Lagging wi-fi speed - Slow turnaround + Spacious + Warm vibe  And then...? We may have caught DoJo on an off-day. Good place to get work done so we'll be back for another round.  ********** Got my drank on:  1. Iced latte    - Watery, weak roast.  Constructive comments: *Option to compost",0
Coffee Shop 17,"A cool laid back spot to drink good coffee, get free wifi and have a conversation. Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Pretty much what you want in an Austin coffee shop.  Free wifi (natch), lots of seating including some soft chairs and an old couch, weird music (nothing says #ATX like music you won't hear else where) and of course good coffee, reasonably priced.  Includes teas, some smoothies and a limited menu of food.  Best thing perhaps? The multiple 10-min parking spaces right out front so when you have to dash, you can.  If you're on the South side just go. Inside of Dominican Joe's",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Pretty much what you want in an Austin coffee shop - I really enjoyed this place. My roommate and I loved the honey cream latte, which was honey sweet, and by that I mean not overly sweet but subtle enough to balance out the bitter aftertaste of a regular latte. I was here in the winter time with a friend and had this drink hot, but today I got it iced and I enjoyed it just the same! The environment was unpretentious, focused and spacious, with an ambience that was substantiated with music that seemed to complement productivity a opposed to being a distraction (also lots of power outlets!!). Lastly, Dominican Joe works with a non-profit to improve education in the Dominican Republic/Haitian area by buying coffee beans from farmers in that area--if that's not cool enough, I don't know what is. Different types of seating to cater to different needs. Classic desk and chair set up for studying, or couches for lounging purposes",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Awesome cafe!!  Easy parking, plenty of seating on spacious desks, plenty of outlets, and fast wifi.  The Honey Cream Latte was very tasty and so was the carrot cake.  The prices are reasonable and relaxing atmosphere.  Will definitely be going back. Honey cream latte!!! Amazing",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Stopped in the other day to see some friends who were studying their little butts off and enjoyed the atmosphere alright enough. The inside is spacious with lots of tables but none too close together which I liked. Friendly staff. I ordered a iced cafe mocha and honestly thought it tasted more like chocolate milk than coffee. Not to say everything they offer is like that, just my own particular order I suppose. The outside patio seemed great in theory but there were gnats flying around everywhere. Why, Joe, why?!  Point is, I'd go back. I might ask for them to go easy on the mocha next time and stay inside. ;)",1
Coffee Shop 17,"2 check-ins Great place to study and work! Not only is the coffee awesome. I recommend the Honey Cream Latte, but there's free wifi and its fast.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Best coffee shop in Austin in my opinion.  It can get pretty busy, which makes it difficult to find a parking spot or a place to sit.  However, once you do, you will be happy you chose this place.  The selection of drinks is amazing and affordable.  They also have music that seems to compliment studying/working rather than being a distraction.  You can also buy their fair trade coffee to take home.  If you want an environment where you know you'll be productive, this is the one to go to.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"This place has become my go to coffee shop. Beverages are fairly priced, they give back to the community, and unlike the previous coffee house, I reviewed the bathroom is always open. Right now they have a great Pokemon Go promotion going on, where you get $2 off your drink if you drop a lure on their Pokestop. What I really love about this place is they're always playing some great tunes.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Love the concept behind this place! Just love it! Nice large area, accommodating, plenty of seating.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Tried this place a couple weeks ago when I visited a friend in Austin.  It was my last stop before heading to the airport.  Atmosphere - just like a previous reviewer mentioned I didn't get a welcome feeling from the baristas. They had an air of attitude about them and wasn't really helpful with the menu.  Drink / food - I got a honey cream latte and empanada. We dined in. I was disappointed my coffee came in a ""to-go"" container and barely any coffee art like the pictures I've seen on yelp. The empanada was ok but nothing great.  I don't think I recommend this place. And I wouldn't come back if I find myself in the Austin area again. Egg and potato empanada. Honey cream latte. Presentation is not on point here.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"I just ordered kombucha because it was late at night, but they have a great selection of earth-conscious foods.  I can't say much on beverages/food, but I can talk about the atmosphere!  Good seating and I found parking in their lot which was a plus. Cool crowd and a good mix of college students and ""adults."" Staff was nice and played music from the 90's haha so I knew everything.  The seats weren't very comfortable.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Spacious, good for ppl who need a place to chill with wifi. Ordered a hibiscus iced tea and a butter croissant. Tea is fruity and not sweet; and the toasted croissant was crispy and buttery.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Updated review 6 check-ins I'll take my 3 stars back and give them 5!  I am SO glad I gave this place a few more tries. The rest of the staff is wonderful, the coffee and tea products are amazing, and the atmosphere is simple and cool.  There is this one apple tea that is heaven in a mug. And a great way to curb your sweet tooth even without the addition of honey or sugar!  I wish I could remember the name, but I will update as soon as I go back.",1
Coffee Shop 17,Best latte I've had in quite awhile. I ordered an iced whole milk vanilla latte with just half the normal amount of vanilla syrup. The shot was pulled perfectly and had a Carmel like finish. My friend got a hot dirty chai and it was delicious! Barista was super friendly and laid back. Will stop by again next time I am in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 17,"2 check-ins I always try to check out new coffee shops around Austin, so of course when I first heard of Dominican Joe I had to go. But the most recent time when I went with my girlfriend, we looked at each other and said, ""why don't we come here more instead of other coffee shops?"" Parking is almost always available, there is plenty of space so that I've always been able to find a table, and the coffee is great too. I haven't tried most of the menu so I won't speak into the quality of the drinks as much, but as far as a study environment, Dominican Joe is one of my top choices.",1
Coffee Shop 17,Dominican Joe is one of the best places for coffee in Austin.  Hannah is the best Barista I have ever come across.  She always makes a perfect coffee concoction. If you don't know what to get... Try their Honey Cream Latte.  I have been coming here for years.  This one rocks!,1
Coffee Shop 17,"17 check-ins I really enjoy this place. The coffee is good and the staff is great. Really a good place to have a cup of coffee and enjoy the atmosphere.  A good place to study, work, or just enjoy good company. Have not had a bad cup of coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Good coffee, lattes and atmosphere.  Breakfast tacos and bakery goods from Russell's.  Lots of seating, outlets and free wifi.  Parking isn't that great unless you visit early.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Dominican Joe's has great coffee. I think that can generally be agreed upon. They also have expensive coffee. I get a sense of not being welcomed when I walk in. It's hard to explain. Maybe a feeling of superiority by the baristas, or maybe just paranoia that I'm not cool enough. Who knows? I can tell you that I don't like the atmosphere as much as some other local places. It could be due to the anxiety I get when trying to find a parking spot. Who knows?  One day I may be cool enough to just stroll in like a swanky hipster and sip my americano in the corner as I people watch.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Dominican Joe is a great spot to pop in to get some work done.  As someone who works remote I am always looking for quiet spots and for the most part, Dojo delivers.  That said,  yesterday a man sat next to me, maniacally writing in a notebook and laughing hysterically.   That's OK, the clientele is typically better behaved.    The wifi is OK- not the fastest, but what can I expect from a coffee shop full of other worker bees!?  The food selection is good, and the coffee is delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Listed in a latte love This was the first coffee shop I tried in Austin because it was half a block away from the bus stop and a really easy ride-to-from campus. I'm glad it was the introductory course to all my Austin coffee shop loves because it's definitely one of my regular go-to's.  Dominican Joe is a coffee-shop that works with a non-profit to improve education in the Dominican Republic/Haitian area by buying coffee beans from farmers in that area--if that's not cool enough, I don't know what is.  This place is one of my favorite coffee shops to study--tons of tables, tons of outlets, lots of light, and the music does not overpower your own. Also, they do PayPal, and sometimes PayPal offers that $5/$8 deal for coffee. Free coffee beats all coffee. It does get overcrowded every now and then, but at least there's a parking lot so you don't have to struggle with street parking.  Favorite drink here is the honey cream latte (I often get this mixed with the honey nut latte from Thunderbird...). I really like it although the baristas give me a mix depending on the day--sometimes it's perfect with the perfect amount of espresso. Sometimes, it's a little on the sweeter side/sour side or has too much cinnamon... I wish it was a bit more consistent.  Friendly environment, easy to like if not for coffee, then just for studying. Definitely hit it up if you just need a place to set up your laptop.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Coffee's not special. I like how every coffee place always has their ""signature drink"". There's only one cafe I've been to recently that rightfully showcases their drink. Unfortunately, it's not here. Fortunately, DJ is a great place to find a seat and get down to business. If it gets too cold, move outside. If it gets too hot, move inside. If you need a distraction move outside. Move inside for some AC and outlets. A great place for your attention deficiency to thrive, but also a great place to get some serious work done with a  solid cup of coffee. Outlets provided, of course.",1
Coffee Shop 17,I asked for a medium flat white. They had to ask what it was saying they don't know Starbuck's style coffee. I said an Americano would be fine and told them I have only been to a Starbucks once and always frequent local shops. Asked if I wanted it here or to-go. I said here. They still served it in paper cup and when I asked if they had a mug they said they did not have any the right size. Not impressed. There are several other coffee alternatives but not being from Austin I took a chance only a local place.,0
Coffee Shop 17,"I was brought to this place with my roommate who insisted that I needed to try this place out. I was looking for a coffee shop where I could work on my homework in a peaceful ambiance and also have some quality coffee-- and this is the perfect place. There were enough outlets (thank god!) to work on my homework and the coffee was amazing. I decided to go with the honey cream latte but I got it in the iced version- it was so good! It had just the right amount of caffeine, creaminess and sweetness. Definitely a $4 spent well!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"2 check-ins GET THE HONEY CREME LATTE!!! Perfectly balanced and not overly sweet, just a tad sweet. We loved it so much we came twice. We are from California so next time when we come back to Texas we are coming back.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"2 check-ins I doubt my experience is the norm as there was the marathon event going on a block away and the place was packed.  Overall, this is good spot for the morning. As busy as they were the wait time was very short. They have all the usual coffees, teas, etc plus local baked goods and tacos. I highly recommend the black bean and cheese taco. There's ample seating both inside and out with a good selection of mellow tunes playing overhead while you sit.  This is a place I'll remember and revisit the next time I'm in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"The service was good and friendly, but I was disappointed with my latte. Latte coffee is supposed to be strong, foamy, and hot. I ordered lattes for my wife and I, and both were weak, no foam, and warm. I brought them back to the lady and asked nicely if I can get hot foamy lattes (stronger would be pushing it). She was very nice and was happy to redo the lattes. However, I was given the same exact no-foam warm lattes. I didn't want to complain again but knew for sure that would not be coming back to this place.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"I guess if you're in college and need a place to hang out and get free Wi Fi, it's great.  If you're not, it's not.  Dirty and not in a funky good kind of way.  When you ask for a double espresso and they serve it in a paper cup and charge a premium price and they know you're hanging out (or were); sad.    Espresso was just OK with a marginal crema.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"This is one of the best coffeeshops I've been to recently.  I am not a big coffee drinker and most coffee shops appease tea drinkers with a few tea bags.  Joe's has a full loose leaf tea collection!  My friends say that the coffee here is also great ... so they have something for everyone.  The environment is unpretentious, focused and it is easy to work on projects using their free wifi connection and ample tables with power outlets.  I am now a regular at this spot!",1
Coffee Shop 17,8 check-ins I love Dom Jo's and come here often for my morning coffee. Stopped in today to try and work a bit on my laptop but THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD I cant hear myself think!  Ugh! Guess its their way of running off the loiters.  I'm leaving to go.somewhere else so it worked.,1
Coffee Shop 17,"This joint is playing the worst of the 00s soundtrack.. simple plan and dashboard confessional. Seriously, as i write this review the song ""vindicated"" has interrupted me from my reading and enraged me enough to write this. Its so distracting (volume and horrid-ness) ill be leaving after i down my tea. i had originally planned to stay for an hour or two but now Ill probably head over to Bennu.  So many patrons, like myself, come to coffee shops to work or relax, not have the voice of a fifteen-year-old boy screeching in our ears.    Two stars for the tea... and the folks working here are cool (assuming they don't control the tunes..and if they do, well, get some taste). This is Austin, there's no excuse for playing crappy music!  Please utilize one of the many playlist applications available in our post 00s world in an appropriate, non-teen-angst manner. Good grief.  Oh, now its the ""garden state"" soundtrack-- the postal service, if i recall correctly from the prior decade. Ugh. Im out.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"Favorite coffee shop in Austin. Great atmosphere to study, work, or have a coffee date. Plenty of tables. Friendly staff. Open later than many other coffee shops. Love their chai tea latte. They also have a cool patio for when the weather is nice.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Love the vibe Love the patio Love the light hearted staff who clearly enjoy their job Love the selections Love the parking situation Love the location Love the free wifi, space, and abundance of outlets Love the Tshirts Love the music",1
Coffee Shop 17,"The ""Dirty Chai"" is a favorite here. Very cool ambiance that provides many outlets and flexible space ideal for group study. Soft music plays in the back, but this is generally one of the more quieter coffee shops. Beautiful patio perfect for sunny days, the only tricky thing with this place is the parking. Still my favorite place to study or people watch. Great drinks and friendly service!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Staff isn't very friendly. Entire place needs a cleaning--dust everywhere. Lighting is poor (read: dark). They do have a big patio area, which is nice! Convenient location seems like that's all this place has. With some friendlier staff and a good cleaning, plus adding lights, this place would be great! Also, honey cream latte is good!",0
Coffee Shop 17,"This was a pretty good experience here, good coffee nice atmosphere. The coffee at first was a little bit not exactly what we wanted, so the re did it for us, and that was nice. The customer service was friendly but they can probably boost their morale. But overall pretty good place",1
Coffee Shop 17,"One of my all-time favorite coffee shops in Austin to get some studying done! There are plenty of tables and a back patio (although it does get a bit crowded during the weekends!). Their ice caramel latte is delicious, and I would definitely recommend coming here if you can!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"This place is whack, from a working environment's perspective. My dude & I came here today to get some work done on our laptops. The place was SO OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD, we could hardly hear ourselves think, let alone speak across the table to one another.  The wifi connection kept dropping, other customers around us were literally yelling over each other just to get a word in, and there were children running around aimlessly with zero parental supervision. This place felt more like a Discovery Zone than a coffee shop. Most likely won't be back...whomp. :/",0
Coffee Shop 17,"One of my favorite coffee shops in Austin! This is where I usually get my study on. There are so many outlets and seating here, but you definitely want to get here before the rush because sometimes the seating is limited (especially during midterms/finals). I don't feel bad spending money on coffee here because my contribution goes towards a good cause :) My favorite is the drip coffee - refills for 50 cents.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"3 check-ins Listed in My C8H10N4O2 Fix Super cheap and GREAT tasting bottomless coffee. Cute decor, could use more seating though but maybe that's because there was so many people when I went. Free, reliable WiFi. Only problem is parking",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I've never seen a coffee shop with so many power outlets. For those tables not near a wall, there are power strips spread across the room (watch your step!) to accommodate everyone.  Free, relatively fast WiFi and aside from the blenders going in the background it's generally not too noisy. More people are here with laptops to work than are here to chat.  Love this place, minus the parking. The lot gets packed.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I am picky about how my americanos look when I get them and this one was nice and almost frothy on top. Also a large is actually in a large cup--solid. Barista was super nice to me (an outta towner) and I heard him greet the guy behind me by name, ask about his date the previous night, and wish him a good Sunday morning. I like that in a coffee shop--having your people who know about your life a little. Good juju here. And w a back patio and tacodeli breakfast burritos...what's not to love? Back patio",1
Coffee Shop 17,I love this place! Its so peaceful. The drinks are great. Try the honey latte.  The staff is really friendly. Free wifi & plenty of seating keeps me going back.,1
Coffee Shop 17,"One of my favorite coffee spots in Austin.  During peak times it can get rather packed, but it is a great place to work or study. There are plenty of tables and outlets, and the wifi is quick.  I am not one for the fancy coffee drinks. My usual is just a drip coffee, so I can't comment on much besides. That being said, the drip coffee is my favorite in Austin. They also make a pretty good dirty chai.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"This coffee shop partners with and supports Makarios, a non-profit in the DR which provides free education to children living in poverty.  You can browse the amazing pictures on the wall of the beautiful children who attend Makarios while you sip your coffee, knowing that you're supporting them all the way from Austin, Texas. It's a great organization to know about and share with others, and Dominican Joe's is the perfect avenue to do so.  It's places like this that make me love this city so much.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Solid spot, decent coffee, great working space for study groups and telework. Staff is friendly and makes a decent cup of joe. The air condition can be cranked a bit too much at times but at least it keeps you awake.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Two Words: Flan Latte.  Oh. My. Espresso.  There's Starbucks coffee shop good, and then there's ""F-R-I-E-N-D-S."" coffee shop good, and Dominican Joe definitely qualifies for the latter. The atmosphere of this place was a mix of professional, educational, eclectic, creative, and focused. I especially loved the music that was being played.  I honestly cannot wait until I have an excuse to visit this spot again. Flan Latte is what's up!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Great Space, Bad Coffee  As a space, it's got a lot going on - multi-level seating, outdoor patio, and plenty of tables and chairs. However, the latte I ordered was pretty miserable and not really worth the price I paid for it. I get that they do a lot of good work, and for that, they are commended. It's just a shame that their coffee wasn't more up to par.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"I'm giving them five stars because I had nothing to complain of (although maybe there is, or ought to be, just one more notch to absolute excellence). I went for (a hurried) breakfast and I had a breakfast taco and their honey cream latte. The taco was tasty (and they had four different salsas with it) and that latte was really special, I'd recommend it anytime. I'm not even a sweet coffee drinker and yet it nailed it. Finally, the service was both fast and friendly: they really made me feel at home even in this cold and miserable rainy morning. So, really nothing to complain of! They did make me really happy in an otherwise not too optimistic morning, and that's quite a feat.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"4 check-ins The space is pretty nice. Location was pretty easy to find. Only downside is during rush hour you might have to fight traffic to get to this location. Plenty of parking available.  The interior is nice. Initially, it seemed a bit warm when I came in, but I got used to it after awhile. Perhaps it is in the summer but there was no problem finding seats. Plenty of outlets and places to study. The place is pretty spacious and open.  Had some of their tea today. Wasn't bad, but I'm not too picky when it comes to drinks.  The Wifi is pretty nice, no problems. I could even stream videos here with no problem. Great place to study or just chill with friends.  Bonus: They have Paypal deals, so you can get free money when you use it here!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Stopped in for a red eye and frozen mocha.  They both came out great, quick service and cool interior.",1

Coffee Shop 17,"Coffee is not my thing so I can't tell you if it is good or not. I just had a tea and that is nothing to brag about. This place is great if you want to sit and use the wifi.

The people who work there are nice and it isn't noisy to if you need to get some work done and don't want to do it at home, it is a great place to go.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Average coffee and below average pastries.  Popular as a laptop hangout spot, but just average overall.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"This place rules. The latte art is always on point, and the baristas are beautiful inside and out. Others have said you can hear them talking, but how can you expect someone to silently work just because you thought you were in a library. Music is great, always different, and the only thing that needs to change is the ugly artwork, couch, and bathrooms, but that isn't what you come here for. Great service, great lattes, and a lighter fare for lunch, that's why you come here.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"This place is a great spot to grab a bite, work remotely, have an awesome cup of coffee.  Always served with a smile and a cozy ambiance.  I definitely recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Absolutely love this coffee shop. Tried and true austin classic. Plenty of extension cords, small tables for individual work, and is open late. The honey latte is my regular. The flan latte is expectedly a bit sweeter and they sell taco deli breakfast tacos for $2.95. I also enjoy the fact that they offer Paypal mobile: I value businesses that embrace new technologies.  The layout of the location is why I come back. The multiple levels of tables break up conversationalist, studiers, and those in between. It also creates comfy nooks for any time of space you're feeling that day. The light is a bit sparse: mostly dark with spotlights and few floor lights. Because of this, I recommend more for computer work (plentiful plugs) than straight book reading. It can also get very loud since the conversations carry from across the room. The wooden tables/chairs are very warn.  The customer service has always been exceptional here. When I call in, there is always someone to pick up. There have been times where a roudy austin homeless roam nearby or give customers walking in hassle, but give empathy to the baristas! They are not paid to deal with troublemakers, yet they superbly handle them with minimal disturbance to other patrons. Sorry I never got your name, but especially the male barista with a ponytail. Give these people a tip!!!  Btw the coffee tastes good too.",1
Coffee Shop 17,Great ambiance and lots of seating!,1
Coffee Shop 17,"Great place to study or do business. I frequent a lot of coffee shops, am pretty liberal, and look for these qualities:  - Multiple payment options: I got  $5 FREE just for using paypal mobile! - Free wifi that is not slow - Inexpensive - Good, laid back vibe with exceptional service - Comfortable seating, spacious tables and plenty available - Outdoor seating - Excellent coffee, and if they have a purpose, a big plus! See their website - Live music regularly - Plenty of power outlets - Great air conditioning REQUIRED in Austin, TX - They got it! - Decent parking, considering location, I've alway got a parking spot! - Don't have to wait in line to get a cup of water, it's available at pick-up counter - Excellent staff, very knowledgable and helpful  I recommend this place to anyone looking for the above qualities in a non-chain, local coffee shop.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"2 check-ins This lil' local coffee spot is about 20 feet from my doorstep. I cannot tell you how many countless times DJ's has saved me.  Their coffee is amazing and the staff there just delightful! They have breakfast tacos daily from TacoDeli (score!) and the best part? Every time you buy a cup of coffee from these local dudes, it benefits kids back in the Dominican Republic (where the coffee is purchased by a local farming community) by putting that money towards education. It's like the TOMS shoe model, only, it's education based.  They have fantastic bakery products like banana bread (my favorite) as well as bagels and smoothies. No complaints on this place.  It's organic. It's local. And most of all, lovable.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"THIS IS MY 100th REVIEW.  I am also glad that it is on a place like Dominican Joes.  Ambiance:  This is really the only reason I come here.  It has a lot of space, and a lot of other people with their nose to the grindstone.  Its centrally located and people are in and out quickly.  The tables are worn, the chairs are damaged and wobbly but that doesn't keep me away from wanting to go back here over and over again.  The place is clean and friendly.  You never quite feel cramped either.  There is probably some way to put in a couple more tables in here, but they try to keep it a Little less cramped.  Also, there is a very under utilized patio type area that is super nice and has plants kind of surrounding it.  It is very nice, but its probably not used as much because there are no plugs for laptops out there.    Food:  Overpriced and of course, coffee type food.  Everything is too expensive here, but sometimes I purchase stuff here anyway.  Its kinda highway robbery, but they can totally get away with it.   I honestly don't drink coffee, so I couldn't tell you how I feel about it.  Access:  The place use to get me all upset about not being able to park.  But honestly, wait about 5 min and someone is leaving always.  If you are patient, you never have a problem here,  finding a spot to park.  Although often.  99% of the parking spots are filled.  Getting in and out I would say is not 100% easy, but its enough to be ok.  Just be careful going through the parking lot.",1
Coffee Shop 17,"Updated review 27 check-ins Ok honestly I've been here over 30-40 times since I moved here ( sometimes I forget to check in- *gasp*) and it is, not by any shadow of a doubt, my favorite coffee shop! There's just something about it that makes me feel like it's an extension of my home/office. Love love love",1
Coffee Shop 17,"The honey cream latte is good, the patio is pretty, but neither are enticing enough for me to go back after the rude service. The baristas were put out just because we asked about non-dairy milk options. They also gave us the stink eye the whole time they were preparing our coffee! You will get a lot of stink eye in general if you bring a (quiet) baby here just for your to go order, which is sad considering there is a baby store next door.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"Hipster vibe, with a relaxed ambience. I love their coffee which is strong and bold and I like it like that. They have a nice selection of pastries, muffins and empanadas to choose from if you want something on the side with your coffee. It's popular as a meeting place and you will see lots of tables with laptops plugged in and indepth conversations happening about the next big thing!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"The coffee is delicious but some of the employees have a real attitude problem. I asked one of the girls working to refill the drip coffee pot and she basically ignored me - I had to ask twice more. She was watching videos on another employees phone instead. I waited 20 minutes for my other drink to be prepared and when I finally asked where it was, the same girl said she threw away my order ticket. I also watched her treat another customer just as rude and dismissive as me. The employees seem to prefer talking to each other more than helping customers.",0
Coffee Shop 17,"17 check-ins My favorite coffee shop in Austin! I can't believe i have not reviewed this place yet. I always get the almond milk latte with sugar free vanilla syrup. The people who work here make this place awesome. They always have a smile on their faces and never fail to put a smile on my face. Their chairs are very comfy and it's a great place to be productive. Their wifi is very fast and they make coffee even faster. comments from people who I have brought to the coffee shop: ""the coffee is amazing""- My boyfriend. ""the hot chocolate is the best""- My best friend ""omg, can we like give everyone here a million dollars because they are so nice""- my 13 yr old sister  come here, download paypal, enjoy a free coffee and become a customer for life!",1

Coffee Shop 17,"I come to Dominican Joe's like everyday before work, and it has never disappointed. Most of the time, I just swing by to grab a Yerba mate and a taco deli breakfast taco. The line is always long when I go in the morning, but the service is super fast and friendly.  Every once in a while I come in for a longer time to do some work remotely. This place is the best for remote work! It's comfortable and the wifi is great. I'm pretty sure they do a bottomless coffee deal too. My favorite coffee shop in the area!",1
Coffee Shop 17,"I can't quite tell why this is such a perfect place to study. It's not particularly quiet or anything. Maybe it's the ambience, solid tables, great coffee, and stellar service. DJ's is a great coffee shop.",1

Coffee Shop 73,"Two visits.. two different experiences.. splitting the difference on the rating.  Visit 1:  Stopped in on a weekday afternoon.  Place was pretty dead and despite being the only person in line, no one took my order.  Both baristas made eye contact but no one approached.  After a 3-5 min wait, no kidding, I left.  Went across the street to Starbucks.    Visit 2:  A few months later I decided to stop again.  I love coffee so the option of something better than Starbucks was worth the risk.  It was mid morning and a lot busier.  Line at the counter to place orders but moved pretty fast.  Barista who took my order was abrupt and rude, but the casher was friendly and welcoming.  He asked about my day while he ran my card, seemed genuinely interested, and somewhat turned around my experience.  Hot day so just got a cold brew coffee that was good if not memorable.    Kind of sad when service is the thing that may prevent a future visit.  If they could get more people like the guy handling the register, I would be a regular.",0
Coffee Shop 73,"Came here during a two hour lunch break I had. My barista might've been the most friendly guy ever. Definitely gave me good recommendations on what to get and talked about the wide coffee selection they had.  Ended up getting a cold brew on his recommendation. Really liked it. Smooth.  Also got a green cart sandwich, basil chicken salad, which was alright.  The place is nice and roomy with lots of light and lots of seating. Small tables but it was comfortable to sit in a couch and do my work.  I liked it! See all photos from Sarah S. for Trianon Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Thanks to the owners of this Westlake coffee shop for allowing our local NTEN.org tech club to meet now-and-again in the ""back room.""

Coffee Shop 73,"2 check-ins Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee I had an hour to kill before a dinner nearby and instead of fighting traffic I found Trianon Coffee. It is fairly well hidden off of Bee Caves Rd in a shopping center. They have some outdoor seating available, couches, cushy chairs, small tables and my favorite spot I found the wooden table perched in the corner next to an extension cord (yay for charging all my devices).  The team here is friendly and helpful. No snobby baristas here! There is local merch, coffee contraptions for purchase, local bites, Topo Chico/Clean water/Pellegrino, fruit, a huge variety of teas, coffee (both brewed to order and ready made) and more. There are about 45 types of beans you can purchase to go with a nice selection of both organic and decaf sprinkled in.  I asked what they could do decaf and was told they can do anything decaf except or ice coffee. Well that is impressive! With that said I went with a fruity hot tea that was recommended and I loved it.  The space is relaxed and the coffee shop is independent which are two huge pluses in my book.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"This is my favorite coffee shop in the West Lake area. The coffee the sell is amazing. Not just the coffee you buy to drink at the shop, but also the beans you can take home. Just pour the beans into a bag, buy, and you are great!  Their staff is uber friendly. Every time I go, I have a nice little conversation with them and they are courteous. The coffee shop has great seating too and a meeting room that you can reserve.  They don't really make food there but they have food from local vendors there so you can get a sandwich or a wrap. Plus, there are restaurants in that same shopping center so you can grab a bite and return to your coffee.  It's not a ""hip"" coffee shop like what you'd see on the East Side but it is definitely cozy and a great place to just get coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 73,Passing through saw the reviews and decided to stop by and boy what a great decision. Great atmosphere with delicious coffee. Love to support local businesses whenever possible. You won't regret it.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"Love everything about this place. Kind, genuine staff members; stellar coffee; comfy atmosphere; good baked goods; taco deli tacos; etc. Local gem!",1
Coffee Shop 73,Reasons to like it: -Cute little coffee shop that has a variety of unique coffees from different places around the US and world. -The staff are super friendly and coffee fanatics that want to share their knowledge and love for their coffee. -Random little knick-knacks scattered across the shop. -Great deals when you get in on Yelp!  Definitely think this place is a great place to study or to get lost in a good book with a cup of coffee in your hands.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"I come here for a weekly meeting and use a private room.  It's soundproof so it's nice.  I'm not a coffee person, but I've tried their Strawberry Banana and Mango Butternut Squash smoothie and it's pretty good.  I'd definitely stop by if I was in the area for a smoothie.",1

Coffee Shop 73,"5 check-ins Quick! I'm on lunch, and Plentiful Earth needs maintenance! I need a nice coffee shop that doesn't leave my clothes, my boots, and my breath smelling like burnt coffee. Enter Trianon!  This is a nice, locally owned coffee shop with a great cozy, slightly alternative feel, in terms of music choice and staff!  I'd like to take a moment to say that I don't drink coffee for caffeine; I drink it for flavor. So, when I ordered a French press coffee, I was surprised and delighted when he asked what type of coffee I wanted from what country! He even took me over to a wall of coffee and let me smell the choices that he thought I would enjoy! I went with the Brazilian.  It's delicious. Plentiful Earth just found a new home base!",1
Coffee Shop 73,Everyone here is so great and helpful. The sweet girl who helped me and explained all the different coffees was great. Steven is awesome. He was so sweet and wanted to make sure I liked my drink! Great coffee shop. Worked on paperwork here and was very happy. Got a chai with steamed soy milk and it was delicious. Their pastries look awesome too! You can buy coffee here too!,1
Coffee Shop 73,"2 check-ins Being the coffee lover that I am when I saw this coffee shop on yelp I had to come... That being said here are my thoughts  PROS: a lot of seating options, serve taco deli breakfast tacos, an abundance of parking, friendly staff, great location, they offer a free coffee with check-in, WIFI, conference room,  CONS: the noise level is very high (more seating=more people=more talking=more noise), the vanilla latte was very bitter(still tastes good but not the best I have had in Austin), it can get very crowded(I had to move a few chairs to get through to wait for my drink), and lastly I got the feeling of not feeling in place. It seems to come across as another trying to be ""hipster"" coffee shop where they judge you for not being like them.  CONCLUSION: give this place a try! I see things I love and don't like about it but I think it's worth the try! Papas and egg",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I was expecting better after reading reviews and hearing good things. I went there with a friend and ordered a hot chai with coconut milk and a plain bagel. My friend didn't get half and half that he wanted. My chai didn't have coconut milk. It didn't have milk or was sweetened. I never got my bagel. I was really disappointed. I like small non chain coffee places, but I could have gone to the starbucks across the street and gotten exactly what I asked for. This will be my first and last visit to this place.",0
Coffee Shop 73,"3 check-ins Good coffee, yummy latte's, very nice staff. Nice local coffee shop that isn't a fly by night kind of place. There's a nice warmth here with lots of locals. It's busy every time I get here, but still manage to find a seat most times. Cold, espresso, coffee drinks",1
Coffee Shop 73,I stumbled upon this little gem on my 30 minute lunch break. I ordered a latte with coconut milk. The service was quick and everyone was very polite. The barista asked me to try my drink before leaving to make sure he got it just right. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone who loves coffee :),1
Coffee Shop 73,"9 check-ins Listed in The Burbs of Westlake - Family Fun, To all the scones I've loved before Cute little independent coffee house in Westlake, in the shopping center with Froyoyo, Michael's, and SteinMart.  I don't often drink coffee, so I can't review that.  I do drink tea, and I do like baked goods.  My only nit is please don't serve the tea so freakin' steaming hot that it takes 10-15 minutes to become drinkable.  Next time I'll ask for some cold water on top.  Their food and bevvies are good quality, fresh, and they have tacodeli breakfast tacos.  I've had their scones as well and they are large and tasty, but not cheap.  Seems like a good place to work, if you are into that sort of thing.  Nice little private meeting space in the back that's free, but it looks like you had better sign up far in advance for a slot. A free small coffee with your first check-in too.   A little piece of keepin' Austin weird in Westlake, something I'm happy to support.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I feel sorry for folks who aren't close to Trianon and have to get coffee somewhere else.  Not only do they have great coffee (both brewed and whole bean), but the people who work there, genuinely love what they do, have fun at work, and work hard to make everyone feel a part of the community in the place.  MANY times I've seen them address customers by name or start making a drink before it's even ordered because they KNOW their customers.  I see a few less than stellar reviews on here but I have to imagine it was the attitude they brought with them that created any negative experiences rather than the folks at Trianon.  Sure I guess if you're looking for cookie cutter espresso drinks with minimal interaction with the staff maybe someplace else is better for you.  For me, I love going there for the interactions with everyone who works there just as much as the great coffee.  Oh and Taco Deli breakfast tacos in the mornings don't hurt either!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"If you give this place anything less than 4 stars you are crazy. The coffee is OUT of this world. I don't think I have ever had an iced coffee like this. The staff, especially the gentleman taking our order, is some of the best in Westlake. We was friendly and helped us come to a selection for our first visit. Went back three days in a row and will for sure be a regular at this spot. They are always busy, and now I know why. Can't wait to tell friends and family about it and bring them to this Austin gem.",1

Seating is plentiful, and the armchairs are comfy cozy.  Also, If you check in on Yelp, you get a free coffee with any purchase. Yay!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Overall a nice local coffee shop that's clearly got history.  Pros: * Feels like you're *somewhere* ... this isn't a stand-up faux style coffee place that could be built anywhere using a helicopter and some glue.  Someone cares about this place and it definitely belongs here. * So far good coffee, their London Fog was excellent. * If you want to get work done, there are plenty of places to plug in and Internet is faster than other places in the area (this includes Starbucks).  Cons: * On more than one occasion, the Wifi went off and asking the employees to restart the router didn't help.  I generally go to coffee shops like this to get some work done so I need a good connection. * Make sure you check the hours.  I've been caught off guard by this multiple times. * Standard iced tea so far has just been okay.  They really need to come correct on this during the middle of the summer.  Other notes (neither good nor bad): * Some of the staff are talkers and very engaging. * Coffee used is (claimed to be) roasted here in Austin for those of you that want to champion the home team. * Some food options if you get hungry.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"4 check-ins I love this place. I am a Starbucks regular and sure they are fine. But local coffee joints are much more fun when available. Friendly, clean and always spot on with their coffee. Particularly there is a young man Steven that is super kind and interacts with patron in such a positive manner without fail. Nice work!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Great place! The staff is super-friendly and knows their coffee! They also have teas and other beverages. Everything I've had has been terrific.

Coffee Shop 73,Great locally owned and operated coffee shop in Westlake. Excellent customer service and friendly staff. Austin needs more coffee shops like this. I would highly recommend to a friend.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"I love this place. They offer Taco Deli tacos for breakfast. The service is always on point and welcoming. They have a conference room you can reserve without paying. It's usually a mix of people working quietly and people chatting, so it's not totally quiet but it's not too loud.",1
Coffee Shop 73,There are plenty of coffee shops in this town and we have another that I can check off my list. What makes this one cool is that they have their own coffee bean shop on the side of the counter to take home. The baristas are friendly and knowledgable and there ample seating. The crowd is a little more on the older side but coffee is coffee. Wifi is wifi. Available seating is available seating.  It's good to know this is here. When I'm in the area. I'll stop in and contribute to the local coffee scene and grab my Americano.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"This place has excellent coffee! They also have a huge selection of fresh coffee beans to choose from. The staff is awesome - they have a great sense of humor, very friendly and knowledgeable. The prices aren't terrible either. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Awesome coffee chop. Great environment, I love to go here and just read a book for hours. The employees are extremely nice. I brought my broken french press there once and the people talked me through using it and fixing it. They also know a TON about coffee and are very engaging in talking to you about it.  Just wish they were open even later, but when they ARE open, they're wonderful.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"We recently moved to the area and this is our new favourite local, it's just between school and house so perfect for those mornings when the child needs a steamed milk to function.  The decent Latte doesn't do me any harm either, my request for a 'medium latte with one shot'  is always treated with politeness rather than disdain.      On the days when I have to drag the  boy out of the bed I can use the phrase 'You know if we were earlier we could go to Trianon'. Works like a charm, every time.  The Baristas are unfailing kind to a small child that asks lots of questions and his 'one shot, please' wimp of a mother,  which makes them superior beings in my book.  The staff are smart, witty and good natured.  What's not to love about a place with good coffee,  comfy seats and good people?",1
Coffee Shop 73,"2 check-ins One of my favorite coffee spots in town.  Hidden away in the heart of Westlake, Trianon is usually pretty quiet and a good place to read a book or enjoy a quiet conversation with a pal.  The baristas are all wonderful people.  They are knowledgeable about the drinks and coffees they offer.  They readily will offer you great suggestions that fit your personality instead of referring to the most expensive, boring thing on the menu.  I really enjoy the mocha frappes.  They have a pretty good flavor and are much richer-tasting than your typical Starbucks fare.  It just tastes more real.  I've been coming here a lot lately- so much so my mom got me a gift card to the place for Christmas.  My only real ""complaint"" is that they close super early.  I like enjoying coffee in the evenings and they usually close up shop around 7pm or so most nights.  Otherwise, I love this place and wish there were more coffeehouses like it out there.",1
Coffee Shop 73,We go here nearly every morning.  We like the neighborhood feel and I like the coffee better than the chain stores.  They have almond milk options which is a plus.  All the staff is very friendly and they remember our names and orders.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"23 check-ins Holy mother of holy----things. I just took a gulp of something I can only describe as a heavenly elixir of sweet, nerve-jolting deliciousness. (The ""flavored"" latte--which I chose caramel and mocha flavoring.)  I have recently accepted a position at a place where I will be working ungodly late nights and overnights and in the meanwhile...also attending daytime training. These days, I normally don't drink coffee (unlike my 18 year old self who used to drink mochas with 4 extra shots added to it.....3 times a day....yeah)...but seeing as I'm training for a management level position....me being the swamp creature in the back of the training classes who is moaning and muttering incoherently due to sleep depravation is wholly unacceptable.  Enter Trianon. I stumbled in at 8:40 on a Saturday and ordered....are you ready for this bc it's ridiculous...""a 20oz caramel/mocha flavored latte with almond milk."" The young lady behind the counter was sweet as she took my order and the badass who executed the order should just be glad I didnt try my drink inside the store...or else she would have seen me bounce over the counter to lay a wet one on her. That's what everyone at a coffee shop needs, right? Unwanted sexual advancements/harassment ??  You know how sometimes, when you're at the office and someone who thinks they know how to make coffee...makes the coffee? And when you drink it...it's like drinking water with coffee flavoring? And sometimes, you'll get a cup of coffee and just be wildly underwhelmed by it's lack of boldness?? WELL...I will say this much....the ""Shot in the dark"" drink (coffee with a shot of espresso)....is truly not satisfying taste-wise. It was just a bit too blah for me...which I think speaks to the quality of the black coffee that they have on drip (And I got their dark roast drip). That's my nugget of full disclosure for this review.  They do have Taco Deli tacos (none of which I observed were vegan friendly---they did have vegetarian friendly ones though)....and a conference room you can rent out. Awesome.  So, thank you Trianon the Coffee Place---Now I can fool my coworkers into thinking I'm a sort of superwoman with boundless amounts of energy....and keep it on the down-low that I'm actually downing liquid crack from your establishment as my secret energy source.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Just discovered this place after living in the area for 2 years, mainly because the name of the establishment leads one to believe it is a Fleetwood Mac-inspired chemotherapy manufacturer, rather than a coffee shop.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that instead of expensive cytotoxin, these folks were churning out a barista blend of coffee that rivals some of the best stuff I make at home (I'm looking at you, Gevalia.)  Prices are reasonable, and the clientele demographics lean more toward moderately frigid white people than the agonizingly narcissistic elitists that sit directly behind you and bitch about the fact that Austin is an ""elegantly dressed whore masquerading as it's former self"".",1
Coffee Shop 73,"This ""coffee place"" brings back a lot of memories. Back in middle school we could always smell Trianon from down the hill brewing their coffee. It was so nice!  It has a fantastic location and a lot of seating. They even have a private ""conference room"" where you can get work done or schedule meetings if you want a private space.  I like sitting with my laptop at one of their many little tables. There are windows all around so it has a lot of natural light and the counter is big and inviting. The baristas are always very friendly as well.  They sell Tacodeli tacos, but this isn't a plus for me because when I opened mine the flour tortilla was completely stuck to the tin foil... womp womp. But that's ok, I'll just get them fresh from Tacodeli. They also have some assorted pastries and to-go lunch sandwiches and wraps.  I loved their chai tea latte with an extra shot of espresso, so yummy!  The prices seem to be pretty standard as well.  Me gusta Trianon!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I chose Trianon as a business meeting spot one afternoon for location, mostly, and enjoyed a very pleasant experience all-around.  Their prices are probably half or less compared to Starbucks and delicious, made even more complete with foam art on the lattes--a choice on the part of a talented barista who takes an extra few moments to be thoughtful and creative.  I've been in Trianon about four times since the first visit, and three of those four, I was helped by one of the same employees who remembered my name after the first visit.  That's kind of rare, especially considering the erratic timing of my visits.  Anyway, I ordered a small soy vanilla hot latte, and really enjoyed it:  it was not bitter, nor too sweet, and I found the foam to be near-perfect--not bubbly like some places like to try to pass off as foam, but rich, lathery, frothy milk.  Their foam is the kind I want to take a piece of biscotti or a spoon and eat up once finished with the coffee,    I wish there were a few more cushy seating options, but for the space, I think the seating is pretty ample, and I enjoy how Austin-y this place is.  There always seems to be someone in there with a guitar and a laptop, writing music.  I haven't brought my laptop in to test out the wifi and get inspired, but that's something I'd like to do.  I appreciate the sense of community the place encourages by offering a meeting space for small groups needing only to be reserved ahead of time.    I would like to try some of their other baked goods and sandwiches, and that's on my to-do list in Westlake, in general, and most certainly at Trianon again.  It's a place that must surely be many folks' favorite place.",1

Coffee Shop 73,Stopped by Trianon instead of waiting at a light to get to a chain coffee shop.  I'm super glad I did.  Their coffee tastes great.  The service was quick and very friendly.  I'll definitely go back for more of their coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 73,Good coffee and some tasty food offerings as well.  It has a relaxed atmosphere and ample seating.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"Bee Caves and West Lake Hills just boast the most rustic looking buildings, but the interior always seem to go above and beyond. In this specific shopping center, you have a clean-cut bagel shop, a cutesy bakery, a quality bread company, and well... Trianon fits right into that demographic.  Inside, there is a huge amount of seating, and the menu is pretty expansive, with food offerings coming from the local forefront, of course. Coffee comes in a variety of sizes and styles, and they brew a couple of house coffees a day. Good stuff, all across the board.  Pricing is fairly standard, but the location is what really sets it apart. Smack dab between downtown and the thick of Westlake, Trianon serves as a superb place at which to rendezvous for individuals who need to do business or simply catch up on life. Inviting and warm ambiance.  I don't know how this joint doesn't pop up more on the Yelp feed, but I guess it has a settled down spot across MoPac where everything seems to move at a slower place, no?",1

Please skip Starbucks across the street and come over here for your meetings and coffee dates.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Just went to Trianon for the first and last time. It looked like a cute little coffee shop, which it kind of is, but the waitstaff/baristas are awful. Very rude, charged me for my order but never brought it out and then when I came up asking about it, the woman had an attitude about it. She was soo busy doing her closing chores for the day, she didn't even focus or care about my order. The coffee shop wasn't even busy, that's why this is unacceptable. I regret dropping a sizeable tip in the tip jar after I ordered.",0
Coffee Shop 73,"I like this place a lot! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Two of them went to the effort of walking me through their (large) coffee selection and also provided me with some free samples to taste. I don't think I've ever gotten that level of service from any other coffee shop. I also really like that they do not have loud music blaring like too many other coffee shops. It's a relatively quiet place where I can get some work done. They have a conference room you can reserve, which is a neat feature for a coffee shop.  I've given 4/5 stars, since I haven't yet been there enough to fully assess the quality of the coffee. If after a few more trips I decide it's up to scratch, I'll upgrade it to 5.",1
Coffee Shop 73,This is my favorite coffee shop in Westlake. The drinks are extremely affordable and they have fun things like iced green tea and jasmine chocolates. They have breakfast tacos and wrapped lunch items as well. And the staff is always happy and loquacious.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"My wife and I love this coffee shop. It's locally owned, friendly staff, comfortable chairs and even a conference room that can be reserved and used for free. The coffee is great, with different specialty selections every day. Free WiFi of course.  They also have some really good non-coffee fruit drinks.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I love that they have a good bit of seating, and different kinds of seating as well. They have some very comfy couches and chairs, as well as some typical seats with tables. I went during what probably isn't their busiest time, and it was quite nice! I grabbed an iced coffee using their yelp check-in deal (which was definitely a plus!) The coffee itself was pretty good. It seems like a nice place to chill or maybe just grab a quick cup to go. They also have a pretty large meeting room with a whiteboard. The location is a little strange- a small homey coffee shop in a bunch of suburban shopping centers. They have a really big menu, lots of things to choose from. They have some baked goods, tacos from Taco Deli in the morning, and some pre-wrapped sandwiches. The staff seemed very friendly and was very helpful! I'm not so sure on some of the types of beans that they offer for wholesale- it looks like a lot of flavored stuff. I didn't get a chance to taste the espresso; I'll update my review whenever I get a chance to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"A few classmates and I came here today to work on some homework.  This place not only has great coffee, but they have free wifi.  We were there for two hours and the staff was really friendly!  This place worked out great for us!  They even have a small meeting room that you can reserve, but it was already taken.  So now we know for next time.  Friendly staff, great coffee, free wifi, and lots of room with plenty of tables.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Friendly staff and great prices.  They have a conference room that can be booked.  People are very polite about leaving the room on time and letting in the next group, indicative of the welcoming nature of this coffee shop.  Great place to meet for small meetings in the general coffee area, or to spend the afternoon reading.  And all that coffee brewing makes the place smell great.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"This is one of my favorite place to chill with my laptop when I'm not in the office.  The chairs are comfy, outlets are plentiful, people are friendly, and the drinks are generally decent.  If they know you're going to hang around, you can get your tea in a giant stoneware mug.  The best way to describe the atmosphere is casual.  There is no pressure to be hip and wear pants that are too small.  They don't even care if you don't know or care about coffee.  And I see very few Macs.  Tacodeli tacos are there in the mornings, but most importantly there are The Cinnamon Rolls.  I'm not sure where they come from, but Trianon, Texenza on Brodie, and Lola Savannah have them.  They sell out fast, but they are the most delicious cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted.  I don't think they are yeast rolls...they taste more like pastry dough that has been rolled in cinnamon sugar and two pounds of butter.  Unfortunate things would happen if I ate them all the time, but luckily they sell out quickly enough to keep me from puffing up like a blimp and floating away.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I work in the same shopping center, so this place is super convenient for me. I usually get an iced coffee, and it always tastes great! Everyone is super sweet and helpful, even when the place gets busy.  Taco Deli tacos are a bonus! Get there early though. By 10:00am they are usually sold out. They only serve vegetarian tacos from Taco Deli, so if you need meat, well... get one anyway. :)  I've never sat down and enjoyed my coffee, but there are tons of chairs and tables, and tons of merchandise to peruse. Need some beans? Need a french press? Need a last minute gift or some chocolate? They got you covered.  *sips on iced coffee* mmhmm You should try one of these!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Trianon coffee is just fabulous!  If all you care about is the most massively flavorful coffee, then go there.  If you like a place when you can get in and get out quickly so you aren't late for work, go there.  If you like a place where you can sit down, relax, enjoy your coffee and internet surf or read, go there.  If you like a place that feels like home, where you are greeted by friends, most definitely--go to Trianon!  Their selection of coffees are amazing--so flavorful and rich!  I'm passionate about their Bavarian coffee but the coffees from around the world are also tasty!   I often get the regular coffee of the day, but I usually treat myself to one or two cappuccinos a week.  Seriously, the baristas KNOW how to produce the most glorious foam you ever had atop your cappuccino.  So much so, I really don't like having them anywhere else!  My family also goes after church on Sunday- they love to get the  latte, macchiato, and mochas--all wonderful.  What's great is with my handy Trianon card, I can pop in and out quickly in the mornings before work.  They swipe my purchase quickly and send me on my way!  And if you get there early enough, you can get those yummy Tacodeli tacos too!  The best thing BY FAR about Trianon is the wonderful people there.  The baristas are so talented and so very, very friendly and sweet.   When you walk in, they are always so welcoming. They really help make my day a brighter, happier one!    I've been to other coffee shops around town (only when I'm desperate for coffee and nowhere near Trianon). But none can compare to Trianon!",1
Coffee Shop 73,The light roast is very light on flavor. The people are very nice. My cappuccino was traditional so thank you for that!!!!!,0
Coffee Shop 73,"8 check-ins I used to go to Trianon all the time for Years. It was owned by an Egyptian man and his lovely family. They ran a lovely business and a great coffee shop.  They roasted their own beans, and had great employees and the coffee was wonderful.  (They did have way too many baskets all over the place for some reason... didn't care for that)  Then some people from Colorado came to town and bought the business... and fired those great employees... and got rid of the coffee bean roasting... and started making crappy coffee :( And I stopped going there.  Now, those people from Colorado are gone, there's a new local owner, the same coffee roaster from before is back (even though they can no longer roast their own beans on site) and the coffee is amazingly good again!  The iced mochas are especially good. Definitely my favorite iced mocha in town.  Hooray for good coffee and people that care about it.  Service and quality standards do seem to vary at times... but most of the time it's great.  Try to avoid the onslaught  of youngsters that overtake this place right after their school lets out ...",1
Coffee Shop 73,"This place is just pretty bad. I was excited to stop into a ""non Starbucks"" coffee shop for a cup of java and a snack. I was really disappointed to try the chocolate crescent which was so stale that I only ate three bites.  Horrible.",0
Coffee Shop 73,109 check-ins This is the spot where I stop for my morning latte. Great coffee. Friendly staff. They have taco deli breakfast tacos and some tasty breads. I also pick up my coffee beans here. Very good selection.,1
Coffee Shop 73,"Trianon is great. Friendly staff, delicious food, and really good coffee. Everything a locally owned coffee shop should provide.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I ventured in here while waiting for my dog to be groomed. I ordered an iced coffee.  I like the vibe here. Patrons are talking and good music is playing, yet I can still ""hear myself think."" There's a guy being interviewed nearby (good luck), a guy to my right playing is guitar (it's not loud) and behind me is a free conference room for anyone to use. Love the free wi-fi! Can't wait to try something new (to me) next time :)",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Trianon was here before coffee was cool .... 25+ years ago. Was amazing then ...coffee roasted on site, Edmond B introducing everyone to each other! Now... Local again... Great staff, Taco Deli tacos and more local foods, great iced latte. My corner has comfy chair with ottoman... Helps with my broken leg!  Only downside  not open late... And crushed with kids right after school. But over all a great tradition reborn!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I don't know why I haven't gone here more. It's really a neat coffee place.  I just wanted to write a review today, because I stopped in and got THE best raspberry-mocha latte I've EVER had. Brendan has to be the nicest and best latte maker in Austin - no lie! I'm so picky about the taste of coffee and I'm constantly compromising just to get the caffeine.  I need to stop that! Trianon rocks!  Like I said, all I can think is, ""Why don't I stop in here more often?""",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I've always had wonderful experiences at Trianon - friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere, excellent lattes. But it's the service that really stands out for me.  Recently I purchased some baked goods that weren't up to snuff. I let the management know by email that I was disappointed, and I heard back immediately from the shop's manager Kari who offered a refund, fresh pastries and a free drink to make up for it. I was overwhelmed by her commitment to customer satisfaction. I normally don't complain about such things and rarely write reviews, but this experience really underscored what a great establishment Trianon is.  I also just love how quirky it is. One on occasion, they had a divided tip jar decorated with Yankees and Red Sox logos. You could put money in your preferred team's cup (duh, Yankees). Another time it was Neil Young vs. Willie Nelson. Random, but totally fun.",1
Coffee Shop 73,2 check-ins I TOTALLY loved this place from the first day I walked in there.  It's so nice to go into a place that has a wide variety of coffee and tea and everyone that works there is really cool.  They also have food so if you're hungry you can get some grub as well.  I would highly recommend stopping in and checking them out.  They rock!  WORD!,1
Coffee Shop 73,"Awesome location. But the coffee is not very good, they served it super hot, no nice china, they do not know how to make a correct cappuccino, etc. Really sad, this would be a  gold mine with descent management and new decor.",0
Coffee Shop 73,"I want to like this place, because it's local and it's close to me.  But I headed there this morning to do some work, and the coffee was really execrable (a cafe au lait shouldn't look like watered mud) and they block outgoing connections on port 25.  Meaning I can't send mail.  WTF?  No, thanks.",0
Coffee Shop 73,"I just love this place. I never need to hang out so I always take to-go. Therefore, what I love about it is the customer service I have received. It only took approximately 3-4 visits before each barista remembered what I ordered and my first name. The manager Brendon goes out of his way to make each customer feel special. They move quickly and always have at least 2 people working so one can make drinks and one can check out. The coffee is fine. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means but their double espresso shot does me just fine. I like to support local business so regardless of taste, I will still choose over Starbucks.  The ambiance is just so-so. That is my only reason for 4 stars. It could be cozier & a bit more modern. It kind of feels like a cafeteria. It's very bright & cold. It's not the first place I would think of to sit back, read and drink coffee. They have been updating things around there, though.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I really like this place, especially the little conference room.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"61 check-ins Usually, I'd give this place a 4. Today.... I'm drinking the richest, creamiest latte (and using soy milk, it's hard to get the froth really creamy, so major kudos) and still smiling from the freaking awesome customer service I just got. Bueno.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I've been coming here for many years.  The help is always friendly, the place is clean and comfortable and the coffee is, mmmmmm!!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Props to Trianon for the great places to sit, friednly baristas the only coffee shop I've seen that (yes) allows people to use a conference room (!!) and keeping the music at the right volume level that allows folks to work.  Knocks for not enough places to plug in my laptop, and the better-than-average-but-not-uber-great-drip coffee.  I may drink decaf, but I like it STRONG.  The macchiato was up to par, though.  (oh, and a demerit to the three women who just sat near me to have a meeting without apologizing...)  This is definitely a place where the work-from-home, small-biz types schedule meetings and get it done - kinda cool that the coffee shop accommodates, even celebrates it!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"First to Review Listed in Best Cup of Joe We buy our office coffee en masse here at Trianon, so the staff has many times witnessed me running through their doors to grab pounds of Panama, only to run out breathlessly en route to the TCBY next door to grab the office's frozen yogurt requests.  Point being, every time I run in, I have this incredible urge to drop my self in one of their sun-lit corner tables, bust out my laptop and stay awhile. The feel here is cozy and relaxed, the mainly female staff is always friendly, and their unique selection of candy, treats, and specialty coffee is unbelievably tempting. European truffles, candy-bar flavored coffee, and day-old baked goods at 50% off. While they prepare your order, sneak over to the retail section and peruse the coffee lovers' necessities. My only complaint about Trianon is their daily trivia question. If you get it right, you get 10 cents off your order. 10 cents?! Straining my brain to come up with the answer is worth at least a dollar.  Stop by and try a cup of their Panama blend. Best I've tasted in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Listed in Caffeination Stations I judge a good coffee place on their iced coffee. It's my favorite, and I will order it in the dead of winter in a blizzard. Trianon definitely delivers. Great coffee, hip-looking and friendly employees, and a variety of local goodies on sale all equal an overall very nice coffeehouse. If you need a place to study or gather over some tasty coffee and treats, Trianon is the place for you!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Trianon is one of my favorite locally-owned coffee shops in Austin.    The quality of coffee and level of service is consistently top notch.  The baristas know all their regulars by name.  This coffee shop is also a great place to get a couple of hours of work done.  There is fast, free wireless.  There are assorted comfy leather chairs, regular strong backed chairs, and tables.  There are enough plugs for all the laptop users.     And, as an added bonus, parking is never an issue.",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Honesty is the best policy here...  I just bought this Westlake Coffee shop...  So I'm a fan...   ;-)   The reason I jumped on here is that the ownership hasn't been the best the last few years and we are doing a lot of things to make Trianon great again. We are now locally and family owned again!  We have a new roaster, and the coffee is GREAT.  Drink it here, buy coffee for home, whatever-- it's great.  We have a new Italian Soda setup, new outdoor and indoor seating (big comfortable armchairs are ordered!), wifi, and we are putting in a conference room that will free and reservable...  Anyway-- try us out!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"I started going to Trianon about 3 years ago.  I was really excited to find a local, independent shop with consistently good coffee (not assembly line).  They know exactly what I'm going to get each day and the lattes are perfect.  The employees are extremely friendly and really take time on each individual drink for their customers.  It is also a great place to get work done with plenty of seating and a quiet environment.  I love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone!",1
Coffee Shop 73,"Updated review Listed in Coffee I've returned twice, and the Cafe Au Lait was $2.25, which is still a value but not quite as good.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I love this place. They have all types of delicious butter coffee and the staff is very helpful if you need help choosing a coffee. The breakfast tacos are good too but smaller in size - works if you are being healthy lol.  HOWEVER, WHYYYY is the GOLDEN MILK MATCHA TEA gone from the menu. It was my favorite drink ever. I cried on the way home.",1
Coffee Shop 52,I was recommended to try this place out and it was suggested that I should try the Butter Coffee. When I walked up and was asked if this was my first time. I stated yes and was recommended by someone to try the butter coffee so I ordered that. I had it iced and it was a bit strong. I was reading other reviews stating it was sweet...mine was not sweet. Maybe I just needed to ask to sweeten it but it still tasted good.  I went back today on a break from work and wanted to try something else. I got the chorizo frittata and it was good even though it was small. I also ordered the dirty chai (hot) and it tastes so good and I'm content with it.  I am definitely coming back to try out the others.,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Butter coffee was suuuuuper sweet, but pretty delicious. Def don't go there if it's too hot or you'll be sweating it out while waiting for your drink outside.  No normal coffee here by the way. You have to order one of their paleo specials, which are pretty good but probably not for everyone. Worth a try though!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 Whilst waiting on a table at Snooze, form across the street I spotted Picnik and thought ""oh thank goodness, a coffee haven"". That's how I found the place.  I glanced at the menu and was immediately confused and slightly intimidated. I suddenly felt unhip and panic came over me as I noticed it was my turn to order...the girl behind the counter eased my anxiety with ""Is this your first time?"". Yes, I am a Butter Coffee virgin, please, go easy on me. ""Awesome, let me explain our concept and menu"".  A few questions later I had ordered myself an Iced Butter Coffee sweetened with Maple Syrup. My husband order the same but opted for half the sweetener because ""he's sweet enough"" (eyeroll).  Verdict: Delicious, creamy and very enjoyable! I'm also a fan of their customer service and general vibe. Thanks Picnik!  Now I just have to figure out how the heck I make Butter into a lumpless Coffee Creamer... Iced Butter Coffee sweetened with Maple Syrup. I recommend half sweetened if you enjoy the taste of coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Came here while waiting for our table at Snooze and noticed a cute coffee shop located in the same parking lot. Such a convenient location, especially for those who need a caffeine boost to start off their morning!  I ordered the Marshmallow Chai Latte and it was very unique and buttery (they actually add butter to their drinks here!). You can really taste the marshmallow flavoring mixed with the chai tea, and it's something I've never had before. The drink overall was good but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish because it's on the fatty and heavy side. I would definitely come back again to try their other unique drinks. Smores latte! Yum",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge-2016 Edition Such a neat place! I have never been to a place that was Paleo-friendly, let alone that had a paleo menu. This place was such coolness! We visited for a quick snack while we were waiting for a table to open up at Snooze across the parking lot. I am so glad we did.  One side of the menu is devoted entirely to coffee drinks. Each drink can be made as is, or iced. The other side of the menu has things like pastries, breakfast tacos, and even sandwiches! There's also bone broth. My goodness the menu made me want to cry. All the things that you know you will probably botch if you make at home can be ordered here! It's just amazing. I would love to come back and try everything on the menu.  I ordered the Marshmallow Chai which had grass-fed butter, MCT oil, rooibos tea, maple syrup, grass-fed collagen, grass-fed colostrum & grass-fed whey protein. I added a shot of coffee (no extra charge, yay!). I could just feel the goodness flowing through by body! There's free water too which is a nice touch, and the patio is dog-friendly--coolness!  Only caveat is that some of the items were a bit pricy. But you certainly get what you pay for. At least here you know what's in your food, and know that it is of the highest quality!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"4 check-ins For all you health fanatics or foodies who want to try something different, this is a place for you. Picnik specializes in paleo, which I have done briefly and I lost a bit of weight. It is a storage container located on the lawn of 1700 S Lamar. There's limited seating and I went from seating on a bench to sitting on table. To tell you the truth, it shouldn't be an issue. Heck why not sit on the steps or on the grass and make a picnik out of it.  I picked up a menu and wasn't too sure what to order because it was all so good. I ran ten miles beforehand and I was ready to eat everything in sight. Ironically I didn't want to try the Butter Coffee because my eye was on the Mayan Mocha. I rarely get a mocha because I'm just into having coffee and not having and fancy espresso drinks. Then for breakfast I had the Chorizo Fritatta and a blueberry muffin. They were small portions. But strangely enough, it was filling. I always think to myself I need to come here more often to try other things they offer in the menu.  Parking is tricky since it's in a busy strip mall but worth checking out. Mexican Mocha Chorizo Frittata and a Blueberry muffin",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I stopped by here for lunch yesterday and ordered a few things. I had the crispy chicken broccoli dish, which came with currants and an avocado aioli sauce, both bone broths (I liked the basic one best and my hubs liked the buttery one) and a mango kale smoothie. The chicken dish was pretty small and thankfully half off, because I wouldn't have liked to spend $11.50 for that small of a portion.  I might come back and try the breakfast options one day. They said everything on the menu is locally raised, organic, and good for a paleo diet too.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"If you are Paleo / Vegan, this is your spot! I came here to check out the menu and I got a large butter coffee ($4.25). I asked for almond milk (they only have cashew milk) and they advised against it because they said it might be TOO creamy! They were right. It was delicious. I didn't get a chance to try any food but I loved the vibe.. there's minimal seating on the porch and hula hoops if you feel so inclined. Don't wander too far into the grass though because you might get bitten by fire ants (like I did!)",1
Coffee Shop 52,"This is a paleo diet joint! I came to this place randomly while waiting for a table at snooze. Thank goodness because we needed caffeine and a little snack. When we walked up to order the cashier was very informative since we were 1st timers.  I was worried about trying their coffees but their coffee is pretty awesome! We ordered the dirty marshmallow chai and mocha chocolate. The mocha chocolate tastes like hot cocoa, I was in love! Dirty marshmallow chai we got iced and it was very good!  Got a breakfast burrito, blueberry, and banana nut muffin. Burrito awesome. The muffins may taste diff since they use coconut flour. I will def come here again for coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"2 check-ins ROTD Listed in South Austin Love, Here's to your health!, Patio and Outdoor Dining If I lived closer this would be my home away from home. The ""Little Larry"" coffee drink (coffee, grass-fed butter, mct oil, maple syrup & grass-fed collagen protein) is a lovely flavorful morning delight and I enjoyed every sip! Hubs, being a more ""normal"" person, had the ""Classic"" a simple black coffee. Embarrassing.  Picnik features healthy fat gluten free foods and coffee drinks that taste amazing. It's all Paleo like the breakfast taco, small but filling with a warm almond flour tortilla, grass fed sausage and pasture raised egg. My brain exploded with health fairies all day long.

Coffee Shop 52,"Man, if you're looking for something quick to eat or some butter coffee, this place is great!  Not only is it quick (grab-n- go style), it is also healthy- everything is Paleo here; grain free, food items made from all natural ingredients and their meats/dairy are from grass-fed cows.    We ordered the Marshmallow Chai w/ coffee instead of the Rooibos tea, Banana soft serve and a Zucchini Muffin.  Everything was delicious and flavorful!  I ordered the Banana Soft Serve with Blondie Bites (per the suggestion of the nice lady taking our order), along with blueberries and raw honey.  It did not disappoint.  It was super light and satisfied my sweet tooth- without the guilt.  The zucchini muffins were also great!  I've noticed with some Paleo desserts, they tend to be dry.  Not these!  They were super moist and my puppy loved them! Zucchini muffin so good, your dogs will love 'em! Banana Soft Serve with Blondie Bites, blueberries, & raw honey... SO GOOD! Banana Soft Serve w/ Blonde bites, blueberries, & raw honey",1
Coffee Shop 52,"So I finally go back to piknik after a 3 month hiatus because of the Severe food poisoning I got at the burnet restaurant. Randy who I know was there, and gave me nothing but grief, saying no one else has complained and asked what piknik is supposed to do about my review.  Then some scruffy idiot who is relatively new there comes to the counter and starts saying stupid things without even knowing I was a good customer spending $120+  a week there until this happened.  They even laughed and said I posted the review at the wrong location. I explained did so because their new location had no yelp listing at the time.  I told them I will never come back and they could care less. They can't even say they're sorry or take any responsibility. The owner, Naomi, could've responded or someone could've said sorry instead of blaming ME the customer.  This business is an absolute disgrace and treats good customers like me with no regard.",0
Coffee Shop 52,We rented a house for a weekend in the neighborhood near Picnik. We LOVED getting up in the morning walking to Picnik to enjoy a Little Larry. Also had their Breakfast Tacos which were delicious!,1
Coffee Shop 52,"I want to say that I am madly, deeply in love with Picnik and happily give them all of my money.  However, I would like to offer up a suggestion based on the ""Great Stew Tragedy of 2016"" aka Today.  I was so excited to see that soup was back on the menu and happily ordered a large stew that I was going to eat for lunch.  I was reveling in the joy that was going to be my lunch when the Paleo Gods noticed my pride and took action. It turns out that the top was not secured on my container and as I traveling to work, the yummy goodness was slowly leaking out with every turn.  As I was retrieving my bag from the car, the bottom fell out from the leakage.  While the delicious smelling stew ended up on my car floor ( thank goodness for rubber floor mats), unfortunately, none of will end up in my mouth.  Which leads to my suggestion.  Perhaps, you could use tape or rubber bands to secure the lids a la  Whole Foods so that deliciousness is not wasted on unworthy floor mats.  I will be back Picnik and next time, I'll bring my thermos!!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"This was my first time trying butter coffee.  The barista recommended I try ""Little Larry"".  I subbed the maple syrup with honey and tried it iced.  The drink was a bit sweet for my liking but had a rich, creamy texture. It was def an indulgent drink.  I would come back again and get it unsweetened and try their paleo muffins. Iced Little Larry with honey",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Listed in Cafes, ¡Olé! The first time I heard about the Paleo diet, I was speaking to an ox of a man. He actually grunted fairly frequently, talking about how it was the perfect way for a guy like him to shed the pounds and still, like, harness chains to his nostrils. The second guy was in his 60's, my bug control guy, he'd lost about 80 pounds in less than six months and his arthritis, which made it nearly impossible for him to pull the trigger of the organic bug killin' juice bottle, had virtually disappeared. That's when I decided I should learn a little more about the whole Paleo thing.  During a ""coffee & tea"" Yelp app search, Picnik popped up as the closest option to our Air BnB. We actually drove through the parking lot, twice, looking for what turned out to be a trailer on a hill helmed by a bunch of sort of purer-than-thou people, in a really good way. Like, their skin radiated and they smiled and authentically wanted to educate us on the anti-arthritis way to live, and they would absolutely be the first cave dwellers to parish, should those days return. The butter coffee was like buttah, baby; we kept coming back for more. Get the mocha. And get a muffin. Our five year-old didn't dig it, but if you let her be your culinary guide, you'd essentially live on quesadilla and blackberries. I, on the other hand, found the muffin rather brilliant, considering it was crafted by a bunch of folks using spearheads and flints.",1

The coffee has a differently flavor with the butter and is pretty good. Haven't the other kind of coffee because it's pricey... Otherwise it is a must try if you never had butter coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Listed in ATX - Potpourri Paleo for the people.  I fully buy into the idea of paleo eating. It just makes too much sense (don't knock it until you've actually read what it's all about). Because this is the way I eat about 80% of the time (love ice cream too much, bruh), it's a godsend to have an eatery like Picnik that ensures everything on their menu passes the sniff test.  I found them after doing a search for ""butter coffee"" on Yelp. Being that I drink a cup of BP coffee every morning, I wanted to keep my habits alive while on vacation. Some may argue that cavemen weren't drinking coffee laced with butter and high concentrations of cold pressed coconut oil. I don't really care about your argument, I just like the stuff. And Picnik has so many different varieties to choose from.  I went with the mocha flavor on both of my weekend trips. Butter, MCT oil, cacao powder, cacao butter, and a little vanilla whey protein. I've had the tried and true butter + MCT oil several times, but this upped the ante so hard. I'll have to figure out a way to incorporate cacao powder into more cups here in New York.  I also swooped up a cacao cupcake with grass fed butter cream and a tuna sandwich. The former was delicious, the latter not so much. But it's not necessarily their fault - very few paleo breads should be used for anything but shingling a roof. But if you want a fantastic cup of coffee and a dessert, you're in luck.  Keep primal, y'all! Butter coffee menu",1
Coffee Shop 52,"What an awesome place! Super friendly staff and the blondies were so ridiculously amazing that I almost started crying when I ate it. (Can you tell I don't get sweets much?)  Super cute little place, most def will recommend to people and I will def be back! The whole menu looked great.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I had never tried paleo diet before, so it was a first time for me. Latte tasted very good, although I couldn't tell the difference between a paleo latte and a normal latte. Still an interesting experience though.",1
Coffee Shop 52,The only reason this place doesn't get five stars for me is that it's pretty pricey for a little food trailer. I usually have a super green smoothie and it's almost $10. That's a lot more than many other places. I understand that all their ingredients are fresh and organic but they are other places as well. Everybody here that I have dealt with this very friendly the service is fast and with a smile and the quality of the product whether it be a smoothie or a sandwich has always been top notch. A cool morning with a cool nutrition drink,1
Coffee Shop 52,"I love, love, love this place.  Not cheap by any means, but their dedication to doing right makes me happy.  Like, smiling while I pay $8 for a large Mocha.  Paleo--meaning nothing processed, think of yourself as a cave man. Could you have eaten pizza, well no, certainly not. (and you shouldn't be now, but it's so good... I'm digressing)  This is the place to go  if you've wondered about the infamous bullet coffee (Navy Seals, paleo coffee, butter coffee, etc--all sorts of lore out there)  They make the stuff with all organic ingredients.  Places like this are why we now see advertisements for Kerry Gold butter from Ireland on the telly now.  Who had ever heard of the stuff before butter coffee?  (those cows live the high life and only eat sweet, green, grass)  Whip the butter with the organic coffee, add some MCT oil (read up--it's amazing) and then add some interesting sweeteners.  I'm highly susceptible to caffeine, but didn't find myself blasting through space.  What I did have however, was a very sated hunger and a long, even energy buzz.  I'm liking this stuff.  There are rumors of weight loss!!  To be fair, I didn't try any of the food, but I love the paleo concept and I'll definitely grab and go from this nice food truck.  And, I'll feel good afterwards because there is no wheat flour (Listen up GF's!), they compost and recycle, and they serve that coffee out of cups made from veggies, not trees.  Oh, and they love my doggie too.  I love you Piknik, thank you for fighting the good fight.",1
Coffee Shop 52,For you all on the Paleo journey this is worth a stop! It was a little on the pricey side.. $50 for a lunch for two. Food was pre-made so it was quick to serve and the drinks were made fresh on the spot! The seasonal iced tea hit the spot on a summer day! Good selection of desserts and extras.. enjoy!! Grab a spot in the shade!,1
Coffee Shop 52,"This s*** is no joke. Just visited Austin for the first time and stayed with friends who live right next to Picnik at the Post Lamar S. apartments.  Tried the o.g. Butter Coffee 2x, Little Larry, the Yeti, and their bone broth over the course of our trip. Needless to say the buzz is amazing, and when drinking on an empty stomach first thing in the morning there were no pains, no jitters, and felt great the rest of the day.  As a caffeine junkie and sure skeptic of the whole hipster/craft food & drink movement - I was blown away and am now sad that I can't have Picnik back home in San Jose.  You guys are doing coffee proper over in ATX!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Picnik's staff and service were exemplary. I felt welcome, and while their offerings are unusual, the ladies went out of their way to help us understand what was on offer.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the taste of butter coffee at all. I really wanted to like it, since it came highly recommended, but with every sip, my whole body bristled at the richness of the drink. I tried it right after serving, a few minutes later, and an hour later. It was still unappealing to the palate, and felt unhealthy to boot. To add context, I usually drink my coffee black, with freshly-ground beans from local roasters.  Again, the service was great here, and I like the concept and space. Here's hoping that your experience was better than mine.",0
Coffee Shop 52,"In my 40 years of living in Austin I have enjoyed many fine local dining experiences.  But tonight I have found my all time favorite dining experience at Picnik on Burnet Road.  The food was excellent and I loved the buttered coffee!  While I do not have dietary restrictions, my wife does.  It was so nice to find a restaurant where we could both order and enjoy excellent food without hesitation or concern.  We also found the staff to be exceptionally personable and thoroughly knowledgeable about the menu ingredients.  My wife and I are looking forward to regular dining experiences at this fantastic restaurant.  I highly, highly recommend Picnik!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Can't recommend highly enough.  Breakfast tacos are amazing, and of course, the butter coffee (I like the original, hot).  My weekend treat.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Absolutely underwhelming.  With all the hype about butter coffee, i grabbed a cup while strolling s. congress on a warm & muggy day.  A cold drink has to hit the spot right? I was expecting a drink w/ richness & depth instead the dirty chai was BLAND... like a cheap frappe from a convenient store. And the powder was still swimming like bits of tiny fish turd in a duck pond.  And it cost a whopping $7.00 USD!!!!! Guess everything is big in TX except taste.  ps. no place to sit so get your drink and scadaddle you punks! pps. the one star is dedicated to the sweet girl giving out free samples.",0
Coffee Shop 52,"Delicious, but I must admit that the butter coffee can get a bit too creamy.  I love the idea and it was great with maple syrup as sweetener, but it's not your everyday coffee.  Luckily, they can make a vegan version which I'll have to try next time.  The location is great for lounging on the huge lawn.",1
Coffee Shop 52,Cute little trailer serving up bullet proof coffee ( grass fed butter w coconut oil) sounds weird but it is really delicious . Paleo blueberry muffin equally delicious. Center piece on picnic table outside trailer,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Updated review Not so good experience. Ordered 2 iced butter coffees and my partner and I both reeeeally disliked them. I kept taking sips to try to enjoy it but it tasted awful to me- like a weirdly velvety fruit juice... I asked if I could try something of equal value and the employee seemed very annoyed and told me ""if you didn't like that, you're not going to like anything else."" I said ""well can I try the banana ice cream?"" (Or whatever the frozen banana bowl is called) and she seemed so reluctant and annoyed and was like ""ok but it's gonna be a while."" So I waited a while, finally tried the bananas, and it had a lukewarm and mucous-y texture. Disappointed cause I really wanted to like this place.  UPDATE: I can tell they really care about their customers, so I'm going to bump it up to 4 stars. I appreciate the tips for other menu items to try next time.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"While there was a 2.5hr wait for Snooze next door we decided to give this cool lil container restaurant a try. It's a GF heaven with fantastic quick picnic style foods that were super tasty. We tried the cold tacos, enchiladas and the spaghetti squash lasagna which were all surprisingly good! Also had my first butter coffee! That might be a habit forming first While there was a 2.5hr wait for Snooze next door we decided to give this cool lil container restaurant a try.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"This place is awesome! I was in town for Paleo f(x) and the trailer was swarmed with fellow paleo peeps all wanting their butter coffee morning fix. The food, service and decor are all on point! I had the mocha chocolate butter coffee, breakfast taco, bone broth and the wonderful banana ice cream with blondie bits on top. Definitely coming back any time I'm in Austin! Thank you Naomi and team! This is the banana ice cream with blonde bits and blue berries - highly recommend! This place rocks",1
Coffee Shop 52,Bullshit overhyped paleo 8$ coffee with pre made dry breakfast taco. Disgusting. Avoid at all costs.,0
Coffee Shop 52,"Updated review I have been the biggest fan of Picnic for over a year. I come here AT LEAST twice a week. The 12 oz. butter coffee + collagen is my go-to, and if I've been a good little exerciser, I splurge on a butter blondie to go with that. It's my favorite place! I can't tell you how many people I've turned onto Picnik.  I wish I didn't have to write this on Yelp, but I couldn't find any other place to contact the business directly. I went in this past week, clutching my loyalty card as I always do, and was told that the loyalty program had changed. Whereas I used to get a punch toward a free coffee every time I bought a coffee, now I will ONLY get a punch IF I spend $7.25 in a single visit. So, basically, I could come to Picnik 365 days a year and get my regular 12 oz butter coffee with collagen and NEVER qualify for a free beverage. I was so disappointed and in disbelief that one of my favorite businesses would alienate its regular customers in this way. To make matters worse, the cashier took my half full paper card and didn't give it back, not allowing me to join the new program since I hadn't spent $7.25 that day.  They don't HAVE to offer a loyalty program - I totally get that! But changing the existing program to exclude their most loyal customers felt really inconsiderate to me, and I felt alienated and disappointed. I really wish this hadn't happened. Now I think twice about giving them my business, since it seems like they only care about customers who spend $7.25 vs. customers who spend between $6-$7 multiple times per week.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"This is such a good place to have for paleo people. Everything here is paleo, which is so rare. Every single time I go the people who work there are super friendly and helpful. The prices are a bit high, but I continue to go because the food is good and I know I can always eat paleo here. The breakfast tacos are great, but I think the star is the blondie brownie. It's so delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 52,Use to love this place and get carnitas tacos from here. Called their number and they said they had new summer hours open until 6pm. Drove from south Austin in traffic and got there at 5:18pm and they were closed. Very disappointing.,0
Coffee Shop 52,"Wow. Holy goodness and all PALEO!!! My heart smiled as I read through their menu. To add to my internal butterflies, the food was amazing!!! I'm normally a ""hot"" person so was a little skeptical of cold packaged paleo food but my lord, it was so yummy! Super filling too!  We got the carnitas tacos, spaghetti squash lasagna and bone broth. I will be back again and again. Love that there's a place that caters to the paleo lifestyle.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Delicious Food.  First time here, we ordered the tacos, spaghetti squash and broccoli but unfortunetly they were out of the tacos and squash!  The only item left besides the broccoli was the Tuna Salad wrap and it was delicious!!! The Broccoli was excellent too, very satisfying, great mix of sweet currants and salty bacon. Our 20 mth old and 4 year old loved the tuna and broccoli. Great place, friendly staff!!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I got a salmon salad collard wrap and a butter brownie and it was the cat's pajamas!  The wrap came with crunchy red grapes which paired so well with the savory wrap.  It wasn't a huge amount of food but very filling and satisfying!  I will be back. A lot.  I also love the vibe there. The employees are so cheerful and helpful. Their Instagram is also awesome, gives a nice peek into their business.  I like seeing bold, conscious businesses like this do so well.",1
Coffee Shop 52,Came to this spot for the fist time the other day. I was slightly confused on what to order but Gisel with the really cool hair was front and center to guide me. I am new to paleo so having a spot like this is amazing!,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Really good spot, great customer service, really lovely lady Gissel attended us. Great Paleo meals, I recommend the blondie and brownie. :)",1
Coffee Shop 52,Staff is very friendly at this paleo food truck.  The crowd is mainly from the neighborhood and feels very local.  My primary reason for visiting besides being right down the block is their awesome butter coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Really liked the service. The lady that came through the line was super nice and explained the menu. She also helped to make suggestions based off what u were looking for.  My butter coffee Larry was pretty delicious. It was really rich though with the butter. Not sure how this is supposed to be healthy for u, but it was kind of too rich so didn't want to drink anymore... Plus the coffee grounds at the bottom.  My husband got the butter bone soup. He loves bone soup- his mom makes it a lot at home. We got the butter version based on the suggestion:... This is where the 2 stars comes in.... Holy cow, it was like... Drinking butter. Overwhelming too rich and buttery to the point where that's all u can smell and taste. We even waited to see if would taste better colder, but no- still... Just. Ugh. Not to our taste at all.  Price was very expensive for a coffee shop.",0
Coffee Shop 52,"This is an amazing concept - a Paleo coffee bar/restaurant doing business out of a converted trailer on a little hill in Austin. So quaint and perfect.  Everything they serve here is Paleo approved. They welcome any and all questions about ingredients and totally understand why you're asking unlike most conventional food or drink establishments. They are primarily a coffee bar with pre-made to-go meals out of the cooler. Their signature item is BUTTER COFFEE. Yes, butter. I had an iced version. It is amazingly delicious! Try it.  This whole place just SPEAKS to me on so many levels. If you're doing Whole30 or eat Paleo full-time, definitely give Picnik a try!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Finally got a chance to check this place out and I already can't wait to go back! I'm on day 46 of my Whole30 (...or Whole90) so I was so very happy to hear about this place.  I got the Carnitas Tacos and my friend got the Spaghetti Squash Lasagna.  Both were so delicious.  Yep, the prices are a little high - but for good quality food and great taste, I'd say it's worth it for a treat time to time.  I also tried the Butter Coffee and it was so smooth and delicious, and now I have all the energy!  The staff were also incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They asked if we had been there before and followed by telling us all about Picnik.  The sun was also shining and it was a beautiful day to sit outside which didn't hurt the experience either :)",1
Coffee Shop 52,Finally came and tried this place out after driving by so many times. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The butter coffee and dirty chai drinks are so good. I also had the pork carnitas tacos which were amazing! Bring a picnic blanket and enjoy some sun :) We'll definitely be coming back again... And again! Delicious chocolate cupcake for Valentine's Day,1
Coffee Shop 52,"36 check-ins Oh, hey, oh  Butter coffee, are you listening? Wondering where you've been all my life I just started living Oh, butter coffee, are you listening?  When you say you love me Know I love you more And when you say you need me Know I need you more Butter coffee, I adore you, I adore you  Miley Cyrus gets my love for butter coffee. Not only can you get it sweetened with maple syrup but they have a bajillion other sweetner options.  Be warned: the food is not hot and is in the refrigerator. That said, it's still absolutely delicious and guilt free.  The food is not expensive for the quality of the ingredients. For example. they use vital farms chicken. I purchase vital farm chicken and it is quite pricey BUT it's non-gmo feed and vital farm's has mobile hen houses. You can't expect that kind of quality without a price tag. IMO, all of their dishes are 100% worth the price.  Grass fed butter, raw cacao, amazing ingredients, and always super friendly people. Perfection!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Picnik: the trailer where your Paleo-cafe dreams come true :) I'm pretty certain that I've tried everything on the menu. My favorites include: Marshmallow Chai, any muffin, the Green Machine and the grilled chicken and green beans. Always great service, nutrient dense fare and happy people on a sunny little spot overlooking S Lamar. Bring your pup and sprawl out in the grass while sipping a butter coffee. I couldn't image living in a city without a Picnik.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Beautiful people and great idea. This little stop is like a food truck that lost its wheels but kept the vibe. Loved the little frittaata and my drink, but the frittaata lacked bold flavor while the drink came on too strong.",1
Coffee Shop 52,Great customer service! Took the time to explain everything and why their coffee is different and came out to see how everything was. Super friendly :),1
Coffee Shop 52,"10 check-ins Picnic AUSTIN has embraced the butter coffee movement and they have done so in favorable fashion.  The shear fact that I will drive out of my way to grab a coffee at Picnik should speak for itself.  I'm a big fan of making my morning coffee with MCT oil and butter, but something just tastes better when someone else makes it for you.  I am a fan of the Little Larry and on a sweet day the Pumpkin Spice Latte.    I've only eaten once and it was fine, but as you have seen in the other reviews that many of the items are from the fridge or not warm.  Picnic does have additional supplies from coffee to even some Bulletproof products which are usually only available online.    This is a trailer so you must be prepared to sit outside or take it to go.",1
Coffee Shop 52,Grabbed a hot cup of bone broth with ginger and ghee and enjoyed the view from on top of the grassy hill. Bone broth was DELISH!,1
Coffee Shop 52,Overpriced and food is very mediocre. Would not recommend coming here to eat.,0
Coffee Shop 52,"So this was my first Butter Coffee experience. Not at all what I was thinking. It's not coffee with a pad of butter in it. They butter is more like the dairy and it's blended in. I was made aware of all the health benefits of the butter, which is certainly nice, but I was there for a beverage on a hot day. I must say, it did have a lovely flavor. Not all too buttery, not a coffee that was made with milk either. Really interesting and I would certainly have one again.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I have been going to eat to Picnik for over a year, my wife is the one who introduce me to the paleo stuffs. And I'm not ""super paleo guy"" guy at all. But I know how to recognize a healthy drink and food with a good flavor and an excellent customer service. It Isaac very relax atmosphere at Picnik, staff always friendly, patient and with knowledge of what do they sell. Yes everybody it is not cheap! But it is worth it for you and for your body. And you will enjoy it. Good job Picnik! In our past wedding anniversary we just stop by for a drink.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I'm not particularly interested in paleo diets but I stopped by here for a coffee due to the great Yelp reviews. I tried the hot butter coffee. It is very rich and creamy, I could see it keeping you full for quite a while. I don't usually add cream to my coffee but I was very happy with it :-)",1
Coffee Shop 52,"This place is Awesome! It was worth the drive from Round Rock. Great people, place and the food was great!! I would highly recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I enjoyed the gluten free options. The food is fresh, convenient and pretty tasty. However, portions are super small. Since we eat paleo we eat at least regular portions. These are better suited for kids. I ended up getting two orders of the tacos. They were fab but ended up being pretty pricey since I got two orders.  I would def recommend as a really good paleo option but prob for just a light lunch or snack. The outside lawn is the only seating option. We loved this but if the weather was hot or rainy its a no-go. Great for letting kiddos run around.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"We are on day 18 of a Whole30, basically the point where cooking every single meal is starting to get super boring. But, we didn't want to give up so I started looking for places we could eat and Picnik came up. We made the trek from North Austin and it was well worth it. Jessica who helped me at the counter was amazing. Having just done a W30 herself, she was super knowledgable and friendly. No anxiety about trying to order with such a restrictive diet what so ever! If only it was this easier elsewhere... Missing a good latte, the iced butter coffee (sub ghee) really hit the spot and was way better than other butter coffee attempts I had previously. My fiancé and I shared the soup of the day which was a really flavorful steak fajita, the chicken Caesar wrap, and the chicken and green beans. Best $35 I could spend during this process! Everything was delicious and compliant which made us feel great. Excited about the north location, as we will definitely be back even after this 30 days is over. THANK YOU FOR EXISTING PICNIK!!!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"2 check-ins This place is seriously the best ever. The best coffee, the best butter bone broth, the best owner... Come here, hang on the lawn, and enjoy this 100% paleo hotspot!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Butter coffee (""bulletproof coffee"") was mind blowing.  I had the mocha something hipster-y.  I mean, leaps and bounds over Starbucks or even a good ole Cafe Su Da from a Vietnamese Pho place.  I will be back for more creamy dreamy goodness there!  (5* for the coffee, keep it coming!)  Now for the food.  I should have passed on the cold steak.  The wings were tasty but... As crisp as you'd expect from fridge temps.  The chicken salad-esque entree was also well liked by both of us as well.  But damn, I eat Paleo all the time and spending over $50 at a food truck for 2 people to each have a drink and 1.5 ""entrees""  a piece didn't leave me feeling excited over the decision to eat here.  (4* flavor)  However.  Food sold cold with no option to heat it on site?  Come on.  I'm buying grass fed extra expensive protein and organic veggies. They shouldn't all be served straight from your storage fridge.  That feels lazy.  (2*)  Ambience was nice, no trouble parking and there were a few on site seating options.  The workers were all plenty nice and service was prompt with lots of smiles, but I'll be limiting future visits to that creamy dreamy butter coffee!  Yum yum!  (4*)",1
Coffee Shop 52,Loved their mocha - butter coffee was so-so. Only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it was pricy at $6-8 per coffee. Love the vibe of the place and the staff was super helpful and nice!,1
Coffee Shop 52,"I write this review after leaving picnik, in line at in and out. I am honestly super confused how this place has so many good reviews. We just spent $27 with tip for 2 ""entrees""-the chicken and green beans and collard green wrap. Both with minimal amounts of food... Like I feel taken advantage of. My green beans and chicken literally had two pieces of chicken. For almost $30 we should leave full, not going to split a burger somewhere. Super disappointed that they would charge this much for such little portions. The food itself was good but not enough to warrant the price per portion. Will definitely not be back.",0
Coffee Shop 52,I crave this place!  The Little Larry is the love of my coffee life.  The drink of my dreams!  If you're paleo and you like coffee...you won't be disappointed!,1
Coffee Shop 52,"I may have spent all of my lunch money on one coffee here, but DAMN. I'm already slightly obsessed with coffee, but I recently cut sugar out of my diet. This means that all the good coffee drinks are off limits!  enter Picnik: the most delicious guilt-free coffee. I'm getting all those good fats and oils along with the coffee I was going to drink anyways. The iced peppermint coffee is le shiz. It is very pricey, but you're paying for some pretty high level ingredients here. I Highly recommend it on a hot sunny day in Austin! This will be my treat for the next month on my (refined) sugar-free diet!",1
Coffee Shop 52,Butter coffee and tea is amazing and gets my day started off right.  A lot better than what I can do at home and what whole foods offers.  Their food is exceptional and the people are great. Thanks for keeping me healthy.,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Had the butter coffee after dreaming of its rejuvenating powers for the past couple weeks. I needed it!  But then, I had it.  It left as sour a taste in my mouth as the apathetic cashier girl who served it to me.  If this stuff is so great,  how come it's not even making their employees smile?  Not coming back. Also I crashed 5 hrs after having it and had a horrible time getting up in the morning.  So. Many. Lies.  When I come to a vegan/natural foods place, I'm always very intimidated. I get very conscious about my non grass-fed meats, my refined sugar habits,  and my gluten-full body.  The service was really discouraging, and now my little spark of desiring to eat cleaner has been wiped for years to come.  Smoothie also not great.",0
Coffee Shop 52,"I'm so thankful I found this place!!!! I eat Paleo and grain free due to Celiac disease. Almond tortillas are amazing, so are the blondies:) I had the marshmallow Chai and it was delicious! I'm so thankful to the owner making such healthy food to go :) I'm a new regular customer...",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Love this place! It's so much easier to make good decisions about my diet when there aren't any bad options on the menu! I'm pretty sure most of their food is pre-made in a different location. It's all ready to go and waiting in the refrigerator but they do have hot tacos and amazing coffee. There are only 2 places in south Austin that serve bullet proof coffee and picnick opens an hour before the other place so I can actually get some on my way to work. Love it. If you're paleo or bullet proof, you have to try it.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I'm so spoiled after drinking Picnik's butter coffee that I can no longer drink regular coffee. Yeah, it's not cheap, but it's amazing! I highly recommend this place. The staff is friendly, the location is great, and the butter coffee is a game changer.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"2 check-ins Met all my expectations! I've been wanting to try them for awhile...but live 5 hours away. Lucky for me, I found myself in Austin this weekend and hit up Picknik twice.  My first trip, I ordered an Iced Dirty Chai...holy cow--yum! If you like chai, give this a try. My second day, I tried the Yeti Vanilla. Again, yum! You really can't go wrong. I also bought a package of almond flour tortillas...woohoo! They actually have lots of little goodies you can buy---salads, muffins, bone broth. All paleo deliciousness.  Wish I lived closer. I'd be a regular!",1
Coffee Shop 52,Paleo options here....love the butter coffee! Had a breakfast taco on the run...was just ok nothing to write about really. Not cheap but worth the extra for nothing processed! Small portions for the prices so buyer beware! But the coffee choices are great! Outdoor space,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Picnik is awesome! I'm completely in love with their iced mocha coffee. I've been there at least 7 times before this reviews, but their coffee was so on point today I decided to write about it. The baristas are always so friendly. The atmosphere is great; lots of nice outdoor seating and music. I have not tried their entress but they do look super yummy. I do LOVE their butter blondies (I've probably had about 10 up to this point haha). Picnik is a great place for coffee, lunch, and healthy desserts. I love Paleo eating - I don't eat Paleo 100% of the time (maybe 66%) but I always feel so much better when I do eat that way. Can't wait for Picnik to open their brick and mortar! Iced mocha! Delish!",1
Coffee Shop 52,Amazingly fantastic. Delicious butter coffee. Super friendly staff. I now pledge my devotion to Picnik.,1
Coffee Shop 52,I hate to complain but Im tired of the poor customer service I receive at this place. Food is tasty and I can't complain about that. So glad that there is a Paleo eatery for us healthy people byt the food cant make up for the employees. I do not like the attitude and sarcastic comments made by the girl with very short dirty blonde hair and glasses. She is always very rude and sarcastic to me. Im not sure if it's to just me or if she is always like this. I try to be nice but she is unfriendly. She grabs the tablet from me like she wants to see the tip I give her or in my case dont give her. I wish I knew this girls schedule so that I never have to run into her.,0
Coffee Shop 52,I was pleasantly surprised by this place. This (paleo) concept can be really good or a complete fail. I had a chicken crunch and iced butter coffee and basically inhaled it.  Everything was delicious and I will be returning. It's not the least expensive lunch option but you get what you pay for.,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Like an adult speaking to Charlie Brown, the words of the cashier blurred incomprehensibly until I heard ""...because butter is good for you.""  See, I have a forbidden love affair with butter, so this was buttery music to my ears.  I can now justifiably douse my (__enter any edible food item here_) in butter sans guilt.  Thank you oh cashier of Picnik Austin.  As a self proclaimed Chai tea connoisseur, I went for what I know best.  I decided to go wild and got the dirty chai. The butter added a rich and creamy flavor - yum.  I also grabbed a salad which was half off.   Half off any fresh foods can be off putting but I was starving and, as other yelpers mentioned, the full price of this little box of greens was just ridiculous.    Sitting on a charming little picnic table overlooking Lamar was oddly pleasant.  Next time I need some butter to balance out my blood sugar levels, I will pay Picnik Austin a little visit.",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Must try in Austin!! Great food, great drinks, great people... The place is entirely paleo! Makes you feel better about yourself and re-energized. The green machine and vanilla mocha-both iced are where it's at. Pretty good prices, especially for being high quality items. Cute little place that functions out of a trailer, with a patio. Oh, and Aerial and Caity were quite welcoming and super rad. :)",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Listed in Gluten-Free in Chicago & Beyond One of my absolute favorite spots in Austin. Who would have thought so much goodness was packed into a small trailer!  We were super parched and hungry, but didn't want to get too full before dinner, and their coffee hit the spot as it contains grass-fed whey protein. I had the mocha chocolatte which was SO refreshing and filling on a super-hot day! I'm always so pleasantly surprised that you don't need sugar to make something taste so tasty (ingredients include cacao butter & powder, maple syrup and vanilla bean among others).  My husband had the Strawberry Banana Bliss with green coconut water, frozen strawberries and bananas and primal fuel. He loved it!  It was so nice to not have to worry about any gluten contamination either as they are a strictly paleo and was reassured no gluten products are ever used in the blender.  Not only was my drink amazing, but seriously some of the best and friendliest service we've ever gotten! The girls were so upbeat and friendly, it's contagious!  A few people were sprawled on some rugs in the grass and we snagged a great spot on one of their picnic tables; we didn't want to leave! Had we not had dinner plans, we would have for sure tried the food too. Adding it to my list of places to visit again next time we're in town for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 52,"I stopped because it was near a house I was working on a project at. I keep coming back because the food is fantastic. Not only that, I actually feel better since I have been eating there regularly. My body isn't having processed crap anymore. I crave their soup and the chicken wrap. The bulletproof coffee is the best. Especially the Mochalatte. The quality of food here is what I now measure other places by.",1
Coffee Shop 52,I love this place!!  Butter coffee ... just yum.  And the folks who work here are so awesome.,1
Coffee Shop 52,"Visiting from California this was my first experience at Picnik and I loved it! I started with the Dirty Chai, it was amazing, can't say I remember the last time I had real chai. Also had a salad, the meat had great flavor and I didn't mind that it was cold - bc it was delicious and I know that the meat is high quality, sustainable, and grass fed.  Back at home, in California, I do order all my meat from a sustainable, non-gmo  no corn-soy-or grain fed, grass-fed, local farm and let me tell you the price is right! Quality food is more expensive and worth it, you should be more concerned why your ""whataburgers""  out here are so cheap. I am lol-ing at the review that said there was ""the meat was too fatty - eww!"" I appreciate a good fat cap, yum!  Other thing that was cool was a yoga class happening outside on the lawn :)",1
Coffee Shop 52,"Best coffee spot in town! I'm a big butter coffee fan, love how filling and delicious it is with any caffeine crash or sugar rush. Naomi and the staff are such sweet people who always greet you with a smile. The food is from local farms and all ingredients are all natural. Great breakfast tacos, lunch dishes, and even healthy desserts :) I love the plain butter coffee but sometimes like to add the collagen protein, so much better for you than whey. It's not cheap but you definitely get what you paid for. I would rather support a business like this instead of Starbucks! Be sure to check this food trailer out if you haven't experienced butter coffee yet.",1
Coffee Shop 52,Super friendly staff. Very cool shipping container design. Butter coffee + collagen is legit.,1
Coffee Shop 52,Overpriced for sure. I will admit I do not do paleo but gluten free. I was excited about a totally gluten free restaurant. We got there around closing time and it was obvious they were not happy to see us. I did not expect all the choices to be cold with no option of warming anything up. The chai was not well mixed or hot. I did order it hot. I was so disappointed.,0
Coffee Shop 52,"Just so good! I ordered the breakfast taco, the banana nut muffin, blueberry muffin, and the chocolate chip cookies. When I first unwrapped the breakfast taco I was a little disappointed. When I took my first bite I was shocked how delicious it was! I liked it so much I ordered another. Both muffins were tasty and good. The chocolate chip cookies tasted like shortbread but we're excellent. Patio is so cute too!",1
Coffee Shop 37,"Neat little roadside trailer that's perfect for a morning cup on the way in to work.  It's easy to miss. Just make sure you pass the Starbucks and then turn right after. They're the friendliest people in the world.  The menu shows off all their specialty drinks, but it's still great for a simple cup of coffee or Americano.",1
Coffee Shop 37,"26 check-ins Listed in 2016 Yelp 100+ Austin Texas The Live Music Capitol of the World, My Favorite 4 Star Places I am impressed. I watched as this little trailer arrived on site and through it's construction. Things looked promising. This location is hard to see in the parking lot due to a lot of landscaping equipment from another business, but it is attracting a following. The hours are still not set in stone as it is so new and they are trying to determine their customer flow. But friend, it is good.  This location is actually just down the road from another big time coffee chain, but it is not the same. You can stand and watch extreme precision in the preparation, somewhat like someone painting a portrait. My favorite is the ""All Nighter"" only in the morning. They have sweeter versions and a good alternative is the ""It's Complicated"". The cost is more than a cup of black coffee of course, but you get what you pay for.  As an added tidbit of information, it is next to a Tex-Mex taco trailer and the combination goes together ""like peas and carrots.""  Well done, and I will be back! Love the All Nighter :-) See all photos from Larry E. for Kowabunga Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 37,"2 check-ins Attended their Grand Opening and I came here again after a night in town.  Found their coffee is very delicious, very friendly staff, their outdoor venue was relaxing, and that it was a convenient  location to drive through and grab coffee on your way into town. I highly recommend driving to the drive through side and picking up a drink!  Drinks can be made hot or cold. Either way is delicious and found I enjoyed many of their drinks.  They put a lot of effort into their beautifully design logo and color scheme. I see a lot of potential in their future.  Come out and support them! Great drink menu! Easy to spot trailer!",1
Coffee Shop 37,"I usually don't drink coffee but when I do, I keep it local and I go to Kowabunga Coffee. My favorite drink is the iced It's Complicated. Added bonus is Kowabunga is located in between a taco trailer and donut shop so I can satisfy all family cravings at once. The service is great and baristas are witty. Family loves this spot - Kowabunga Coffee, tacos from Tino, donuts from The Donut Hole",1
Coffee Shop 37,"First to Review They have a fun menu of specialty drinks but can also accommodate standard drinks like americano and chai tea. Many places make watery chai tea but this place does it right. There's a storage crate in front of Kowabunga Coffee that you can climb on top of with stairs to look down on the plebs, err, I mean the street and nearby areas. There's also a gazebo structure behind the place to rest under. Drive thru window",1
Coffee Shop 37,Great service! Coffee was delicious - smooth taste! We all tried different things from menu and all were soo tasty! Definitely going back! Kowabunga iced coffee!,1
Coffee Shop 37,"Outstanding! Small road side stand that you could miss if you blinked but well worth it. I got the ""it's complicated"" which is an espresso drink with almond rocha and white chocolate flavoring. Drinks are available hot or cold.",1
Coffee Shop 37,Just got the All Nighter and I have to say it was a great one so much better than anything you could get from the coffee store up the road. It was smooth and tasted great no burned taste at all! My eyes are bugging out now from the rush of caffeine that's what coffee should do.,1
Coffee Shop 37,Great service and delicious drinks! I managed to show up during the Grand Opening and I'll definitely be stopping by again.,1
Coffee Shop 37,"I just got 6 shots of espresso for $4, how can it get any better!  Tasted amazing and keep me up late just like I needed it to.  Thanks!",1
Coffee Shop 37,"Excellent coffee! Nice rapport with customers, very relaxing to come get a cup of delicious coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 37,The first kiss (hot) and the friend zone (iced) are delicious ! Super chill spot to get a cup of joe on the go. :-) the owner was awesome to talk to. Always great to support local businesses ! Stop by and try it out.,1
Coffee Shop 37,A nice departure from Starbucks...it's nice having a local variety available. The coffee was delicious and strong. I had the Americano and my husband had the trophy wife. The trophy wife was a bit strong but I added some of my plain Americano to it to help balance it out. The service was fast and very friendly workers. It's also a pretty convenient location. Only problem is that is is kind of expensive. A small black coffee is $3.50. I'm okay with it though since you are supporting a local business.,1
Coffee Shop 37,"Great iced coffee.  Friendly staff that helped with deciding on drink for first time.  I missed the sign the first time and had to do a u turn.  It's between the plant nursery and donuts place.  There is a good authentic taco truck there too.  Goes well with the coffee.  If the location was a little easier to get in and out of, I'd come here every day.",1
Coffee Shop 37,"I had the pleasure of visiting Kowabunga Coffee for its grand opening last Saturday, and the coffee did not disappoint! The Kowabunga team searched tirelessly for the best shot of espresso and they certainly found it. They have a fun selection of drinks on the menu - I tried the ""first kiss"" iced, which was vanilla, dark chocolate, and espresso, and it was absolutely tasty and refreshing for hot day.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I love Kick Butt! Large sizes, super strong cold brew, and food and snacks! There's been times where I haven't been able to swing by for a while and they always remember my order. When I feel like trying something different, there's a huge menu of options. The iced mint mocha is my current favorite.  They have shows of all sorts as well- from punk rock to poetry readings to stand up comedy. Plus, booze! Mmm... now I want to pop in there and grab something yummy!",1
Coffee Shop 36,134 check-ins The coffee ninjas here are the best! The coffee is good and strong. And every cup has a minimum of 2 shots. I come here so often I don't even have to ask for my coffee anymore. It's pretty much ready when I get to the counter. I'm willing to pay a little more for my coffee for such great service.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"ROTD The Good: I've only been during day hours but heard they offer so much more than coffee that I need to check out.  Internet works fast and coffee is great. Customer service is great also.  The Bad: I usually visit coffee shops to get out of the house and work elsewhere so I stay at the location for about 2ish hours. I'm not a fan of places who charge for refills, most don't but Kickbutt does charge .75 for a refill (hot coffee). Their coffee is already a little higher than nearby coffee shops and don't charge for refills so that will probably be the reason why I stick to my usual spot. Free refills will win me every time!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Wandered in on a Sunday afternoon.  Coffee, cocktails, live music and food ?!?    Great acoustic group, enjoyed with a martini.  On Sunday mid-day, no less.  God, Austin is awesome! Rotating group of local songwriters that plays every second Sunday of the month",1
Coffee Shop 36,"2 check-ins I really appreciate the unique vibe and decor here.  The heavy red and black does not feel like the usual urban hipster coffee house (concrete, brushed metal, natural wood, and some carefully chosen hip accent color--this look has become ubiquitous, kind of like a coffee mecca McDonald's).  They have a stage for music and open mic events, on one of my visits I heard young hipsters auditioning to be the Trivia Night emcee (my knowledge of old TV allowed me to crush one question only, but the rest of the time my huge gaping void of comic book and video game knowledge made me a loser).  The drinks that I have had here were to my expectations, the baristas can make a good cappuccino or latte.  I like a venue that tries to be what coffee houses first were in Europe centuries ago--a gathering place where the caffeine can stimulate conversation and ideas.  Good mission!!",1
Coffee Shop 36,I've been here a few times and finally decided to write a review.  The iced lattes are good but wayyyy too expensive and the milk doesn't taste fresh.   I ordered a medium iced latte and the worlds smallest breakfast burrito and the price was over $9.    The first time I came here to work I loved the vibe and the blues guitar music playing.  The second time I came here the barista was rude to everyone and was only playing scary movie soundtracks for two hour straight.  Only slightly better then nails on a chalkboard for two hours straight.  At least the wifi was strong.    I've been here at night once for $2 comedy night and that was great.  I might come back for that but I cannot recommend this as a grab and go breakfast coffee shop. Worlds smallest breakfast taco,0
Coffee Shop 36,Super strong cold brew!!! Great atmosphere,1
Coffee Shop 36,"I think that I have to preface this review by saying that sometimes the sight of children just turns people off.  My friend and I walked in with my two kiddos (a 2 yr old and a 2 month old).  We are the only new patrons, with a few folks seated around the place.  We walk up the the ordering spot, my stands there for a minute and orders, and I walk up before he's paid and order some food.  I ask the girl that made the coffees if the chicken salad sandwich is good and she tells me she's a vegetarian, so I agree that asking her that question doesn't work - I ask if people seem to like it in general and I don't know if I am asking two too many questions or what but I get this shitty vibe from her. It was as though I was supposed to know she didn't eat chicken.  I get the sandwich it is spicy as I was warned against but wasn't that great aside from that.  I can't even say what it tasted like.  **The coffees were good**, the food I wouldn't write home about and the service just made me feel uncomfortable.  It was like I walked into a party I wasn't invited to.  **the owner's comment is accurate. He took the time to text out to me and follow up with his employee. He was not defensive and is obviously committed to running a good business.",0
Coffee Shop 36,"It's coffee, it's karate, and now it's music too. Seems like the success of Strange Brew with their music lounge has given other coffee shops a loftier goal to shoot for, and Kick Butt is going for it.  They've recently remodeled and doubled their space, moving the stage from a corner afterthought to a raised corner focal point, complete with pro sound and lighting. The tabled area is much larger, and they've added a full bar and kitchen for food, though they're not serving the full menu at night.  On the nights they have live music, they stay open later than their posted hours, so call to check before you head out. We saw a full rock band there recently and they started at 9PM. No wimpy music for a place called Kick Butt.  The coffee and sandwich vibe is still there during the day, so they're a good hangout and work/study  option if you're in the area. And if you're not into karate, don't worry, no pressure. Personally, I think Jackie Chan is kinda hot. Dave Ducharme-Jones Band on the new stage. Enlarged stage area with full sound and lighting Enlarged dining area See all photos from Karol M. for Kick Butt Coffee Music & Booze",1
Coffee Shop 36,Super close to My place. Food and full service bar on the weekends till 2 AM. Live shows of different kinds. Bärtender/cashiers very chill and friendly. Would bring my kid if I had one,1
Coffee Shop 36,"Great place, the WiFi is also excellent speedtest.net/my-result/…",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Kick Butt Coffee stands up to it's name. I absolutely love the mint green tea frappe that's one of my favorite drinks. It's so hard to choose because there are so many great choices on the menu. The barista's are friendly and knowledge and make great recommendations when you're like me and have a hard time. I've have had a great experience every time I visit. My kids love the smoothies, sammies, pizza and cookies. I won the $250 in gift cards back in October 2011 and my husband and I have been  loyal Kick Butt fans ever since. (Can't believe it's been that long) We drive from Pflugerville to Austin for Kick Butt just because we love it.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Long time customer of Kick Butt here. My husband and I have been hanging out at KB since June 2008! Since the expansion this has become THE PLACE to be! The venue is really awesome. If you haven't been in a while, you'll want to come check it out. My favorite drink is the iced caramel latte (made by Alyssa!). Unlike some other places, the drink is really smooth & has the perfect amount of sweet caramel. KB also has a pretty decent menu of food. The Mediterranean pizza is really yummy. I ask for extra toasted. The Tyler Durden sandwich is also really good. I get it with a Cesar side salad & a side of cha cha sauce for my sandwich (on toasts croissant). So good!  Kick Butt has events every night of the week. The Thursday night music open mic is the best in town. Fantastic musicians & great crowd. And Dan serves up some mean drinks! If you didn't know, they have a full bar! Salted caramel frappe",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Extremely impressed with Kick Butt Coffee! The store front is VERY inconspicuous, don't be fooled - once you enter this legendary venue you'll be transported into an insanely cool bar, full of awesome people, local color, and KICK BUTT ATMOSPHERE!  Yeah, lame pun but it's a damn cool place. I would highly recommend going here because not only does their coffee kick butt (it's smooth and delicious) their homemade cookies and breakfast tacos are da bomb!  Check out Kick Butt Coffee if you live in the North Loop/Airport area because it's a hell of a lot cooler here than it is at the other hipstery ""too cool for school"" coffee houses nearby.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"2 check-ins Breakfast tacos, legit coffee, AC in this blistering Texas sun, ninja movies playing in the background, donuts, live music, AND booze!!!! They crushed it! Gluten free tiny donuts, to get the gluten free community use to baked goods again.",1
Coffee Shop 36,Updated review Never go there for open mic. Sound Guy's an asshole. He threw away my drink and kicked me off stage. Pretentious AF. I was gonna buy a drink afterwards but we were rushed off the stage and out of the building. Rude.,0
Coffee Shop 36,Showed up on sunday. One coffee chick doing her job well and efficiently. Church music band was a greasy welcome for the am. Spent days in Austin. Not a church in sight. Maybe one or two on the outskirts . loved the entire time. Highly recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"3 check-ins Great little place for coffee, wine, and music!!! A true Old Austin feel and my regular morning coffee stop!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I've been sitting here for the past 2 hours working on a term paper and I thought I'd take a quick break to write about this place.  First off, I love how the owner is often hanging out here, drinking a coffee, interacting with customers and employees, just chillin.  There's something charming to me about a restaurant or bar where the owner can be found reading the paper or balancing their books.  Like they have have created the kind of place they would want to go to on the regular.    I love the food selection here.  Get here early enough and they have some tasty tacos.  TBH they're a little small for me but they are quite tasty.  They also carry greek parfait, bagels, pizza, sammiches, and other delicious treats.    The coffee is great as well.  Very flavorful.  It has a nice balance, doesn't taste like tea, or burnt. And of course it's great that they have alcohol.  I miss the Green Muse because I use to love working at a coffee shop all day and then come 6-7pm switch over from coffee to a good beer.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Easier to study here in the daytime when things are calm, before all of the open-mic, pub quiz type stuff that happens here most nights.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Nearly $7 for a small cup of no-refill coffee and a two-bite muffin the size of a marshmallow...Kick Butt Coffee D.B.A. Kick My Wallet Coffee.  ...these guys must really be specialists in the martial arts rather than business as their retail price points lends one to think there MUST be more than coffee in this tiny serving; I wish there was cuz the coffee isn't all that either...or maybe it was the stress hormones from getting gouged which were overwhelming the coffee's intended effects. Alas, I'll never know as I won't be coming back unless I win the lottery...sighhh.  Finally I left with the feeling that I, the naieve customer (*ahem* Target), was a bother to them...as if they had better things to do than serve customers (maybe because it's all a front as they are really fighting crime with the Ninja Turtles...now that's worth the $7! :). Perhaps the lack of hospitality was due to the fact that I had no money left to tip them for the laborious task of spigoting coffee and pinching a microscopic muffin.  All this to say;I feel that they take themselves way too seriously despite the tongue-in-cheek decor...at least mgt can ask the baristas to smile while pillaging our wallets! :/",0
Coffee Shop 36,Excellent iced coffee! They even sell concentrate. Get the Elgin sausage breakfast taco,1
Coffee Shop 36,I had planned on ordering food when I saw the female cook walk out of the restroom either tucking her under wear back into her pants or digging for something. Either way she had her hand down the back of her pants. Immediately after seeing her do that she walked in and out of the kitchen carrying customer consumables. Your food items. She did not wash her hands after touching her rear end. Absolutely disgusting. Ugghh. Have fun with your ecoli poisoning. Needless to say I did not order food nor would I recommend others to either. Yikes.,0
Coffee Shop 36,I just moved into this area and there is a lot that is still being developed/remodeled. I'm so glad this is in the neighborhood! I'll be coming here very often. :),1
Coffee Shop 36,"17 check-ins I really like this place. It caters to several types of consumer. It serves the hard core coffee shop crowd, the gotta get a morning bite crowd, the entertain me crowd and also the I just want a relaxing, delicious cup of Joe served by friendly folks crowd (my type). The baristas are friendly and they will chat if they're not insanely busy. There is a large selection of morning (my visit time) goodies including muffins, bagels, cookies, breakfast tacos and (drum roll) Round Rock donuts. What a great idea to have these delightful donuts in this part of Austin. I haven't visited yet outside of the morning hours, but the place is set up for some raucous night time fun. There are nightly activities and events posted on the wall. From the other reviews it must really get to hopping. Friendly folks, nice bites and kick butt coffee, a good combination.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Best coffee ever! It's a great place to hang out. I go to McCallum High School that's 2 minutes from here and I come here sometimes before school starts. The staff is really chill. Now, where's my $250?!  Jack Rodriguez Cold Brew",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Great space, decent drink selection!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"This place has a cool atmosphere and I really dig it...the main problem I noticed when I walked in the door is the funky smell that does not go with a coffee place.  I cannot describe it, but it through me off.  The place otherwise looks like a cool place to hang.  They apparently have live music and maybe even a DJ area?  Anyways other than the smell it seems cool.  I keep saying seems, because I was there around 2pm and it was pretty dead as I would expect.  I can't imagine with the amount of space how they will survive but hopefully they will.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Kick Butt Coffee have some kick butt smoothies and tacos. The place is nice and friendly. A coffee shop by day, a bar by night!

Coffee Shop 36,"The place is great, all the staff is extremely friendly. Unfortunately due to a series of events we will not be attending, promoting or performing at Kickbutt coffee anymore due to Mike. We recently performed with a touring band and we were told there will be a door person and sound guy and none was provided nor no reason why except for one person being sick. It was disorganized and we were expected to run our own sound with unfamiliar equipment. The touring act was mistreated and insulted by Mike and it showed how Kickbutt doesn't care about touring and local musicians. We will not be recommending this place for future acts. We hope this issue gets resolved. It sucks to down such a cool place because of one person.  Here is a link with more details that was just posted on indie on the move from one of the bands. indieonthemove.com/venue…",0
Coffee Shop 36,Stopped in here a couple of times recently. It's nice to have a full bar in a coffee place and live music some nights makes it a great place to hang out.  The staff is friendly and helpful and I'll be returning again soon.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"Had been wanting to try a new place. Weird smell going in. $10 for 2 small coffees that weren't anything amazing. Hot mocha i ordered was warm not hot. Kitchen was closed even though we went at 1245 on a Saturday. The counter lady didn't tell us this until we ordered even though we were standing there looking at the food menu for over 5 minutes. While trying to place my order the lady taking the order interrupted me twice to have a side conversation with another employee and offered no apology. Was going to get a donut, but there were flies in the display case. Extremely disappointed. Will not be back.",0
Coffee Shop 36,Coffee is much much better than the mainstream places. It's a funky little shop with a great vibe and even better coffee! I might be addicted on the first try.,1
Coffee Shop 36,I love this place.  They have great coffee and BRILLIANT coffee cocktails. The atmosphere is chilled. There is a ton of room so that everyone gets their own space.  They also have open mic in the evenings.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" This place kind of reminds me of the Antichrist, but in a nice way. When I was there it was all dark & red & Kanye West, with the most unusual crowd I've ever seen in a coffee place. TSA would have had a field day with us.    But what the hell, that's what makes Austin interesting. Would I ever take advantage of their full bar & interesting food menu? Probably not. But what makes me a fan here is the nice counterperson who was concerned about the temperature of my straight black from their thermos, and I said go ahead & just nuke it. She gave me a big discount. Was it the best cup I've had in recent memory? Not really, but sometimes genuine customer service is all you need to Kick Butt. Even the billboard outside of Kick Butt is a little out of the box..., Kick Butt interior. My cup. Yeah, I need to clean it more often...",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I 've been going to Kick but since they first opened.  I grew up nearby, so this and Epoch were regular stops.  I've since moved around and now reside in Cedar Park, so I come very infrequently now.  When I am in the area visiting family, I try to stop in, but haven't for awhile as my husband prefers Epoch.    I get emails regularly from Kick Butt so I feel like I know a lot about their history.  I appreciate the owner's passion for his place, and I remember the set backs and bumps along the way (like when the triangle location closed).  There are a lot of good coffee places in Austin, but I always rooted for Kick Butt, and often worried about it's future during that rough time.    I'm happy to say, after my visit today, that those worries are gone.  I was in the neighborhood, and my husband wasn't there with veto power, so I dipped in.  The place looks fantastic after the much needed expansion!  The coffee was better than I remember it too.  I got lunch and enjoyed my time there.  Quiet, and laid back.  I even got a second complimentary drink to have with my meal.    I wish I still lived close, I would be coming daily if I did after seeing and tasting the difference today.  When I'm in the neighborhood, this will be my destination for coffee.  I'll override my husband on this matter.  lol",1
Coffee Shop 36,Arrived here just before 7am on a Wednesday with my boyfriend and we were the only customers.  We asked for a few different items off their breakfast menu and were told they couldn't make them for us because they were still getting things ready. We settled for the coffee paired with round rock donuts and it was anything but delicious! Our bill for 5 donuts and two coffees was $25!! Just that alone left a sour taste in my mouth! Not impressed and would not recommend this place to anyone!,0
Coffee Shop 36,"Was going to give it 3 stars, but the review title says ""A-Ok""...well atmosphere is fantastic, plenty of room to sit down and work, great place for a group or a meeting, but the prices are outrageous. $7 for a 20oz latte (going rate is around $5 everywhere else in town). What the heck!!!! I was here in the early AM hours when there wasn't any music, so not sure how things are in the evening, but if you work remote a lot like I do the atmosphere is great for that, just expect to pay more or your coffee than anywhere else in town.",0
Coffee Shop 36,Pretty good sound. Its a lot cooler since the last time I was here. The space is bigger and has a more laid back feel. Their food is simple but delicious. The coffee is strong.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"Ive been regularly visiting Kick Butt since my office moved in down the street. I recommend the (1) chai tea latte blended with their two different chai mixes, (2) the americano with two shots of espresso, (3) and their iced coffee. All are wonderful drinks to refuel your engine.    If you can get there early enough, I also recommend you try their tacos! Delicious.  This cafe is a bar too so... Yes, please!  The service is always great and the atmosphere is original and cool.  My only gripe is that the drink prices are comparable and sometimes more expensive than the big chains.  If you're like me in this respect, grab a punch card for your 10th free drink and look for the many opportunities for BOGO!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Listed in Java Addiction I popped in here to grab some morning Joe and everyone was kung-fu fighting.  Nah, not really, but the Asian influence, dojo vibe was definitely in full-effect all over this coffee shop/bar/music venue. Yeah, it's the best of all three of worlds, obviously catering to the morning, afternoon and evening crowds like no place I've ever seen before. I loved looking around the large, spacious venue while waiting for my large, iced caramel latte.  I really hated to leave at that point, but hunger and a long drive ahead awaited me, which was much more enjoyable with the delicious, cool drink in my cup holder. A great find in a little out-of-the-way strip mall in northern Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"The atmosphere was fun (those decorations though!), laid back, and when I got there they had some live music going!

The kickin chicken sandwich is a favorite of mine, some of the best chicken salad I have ever had. They also play a great music selection during the day, you are not stuck listening to the same type of music all day. I have not had a chance to come here in the evening but that will change soon.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"This place is okay. And it's close. But 4.75 for a mediocre, medium sized iced coffee? Completely ridiculous pricing. Will not be coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 36,"Great spot close to home... Had never been here but heard about a Friday night comedy showcase and coupling that with the word of mouth reviews, I finally gave it a shot! Coffee was great, and Dan definitely left a lasting impression that will bring me back for my second visit.  Will definitely find time soon to check their schedule and see what other events they have going on... Oh, and nobody kicked my butt, so that was nice.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"The atmosphere is nice.  The arts, music and comedy are nice.  They have wifi and plugs.  They offer overpriced coffee drinks, a large latte with soy is currently over $6 after tax!  They either don't have or are always out of almond milk.  Their breakfast taco selection is limited.  At night, in winter of 2016,  they had a barista guy working who seemed to hate his job, serving, people, or comedy night.  Their overpriced margarita is tequila with a super cheap bottled margarita mix.  I did not dare try it.  They don't put their prices on the menu because their prices are outrageous, especially in this neighborhood.  It's the most expensive coffee/bar in Austin, and the least likely to have what you are looking for, aside from the arts and entertainment or a place to sit or work.",0

Coffee Shop 36,Will not return to Kick Button Coffee. The coffee was bitter and my muffin was hard and stale.,0
Coffee Shop 36,"I used to go to Epoch Coffee EVERY DAY for the last 6 months until they decided to change their vanilla powder to a vanilla bean powder that was NOT good.. So I decided to try out other coffee shops to see if I could find one I would LOVE again. After having a few failed attempts, I went to Kick Butt Coffee after reading their amazing reviews, and I finally found THE PLACE. When I first walked in, I saw a stage and a lot of cozy seating areas. I thought it was really nice, but since I always just get my coffee togo, I never got to actually sit and enjoy the ambiance. They have a huge menu and have ALOT of pastries as well. The baristas were very kind when I asked if they had something similar to what I was looking for, and they were kind enough to help me find it. And OMG.. their uniforms are SO CUTE too!! I went here for a couple weeks probably daily, but then realized I was spending way too much money on my daily coffee, and since then, have been making my vanilla-hazelnut blends at home. I haven't gone back but if I'm ever in the area, I will definitely go back! You should check this place out!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Updated reviewGrabbed a latte at Kick Butt this morning. As I entered I was immediately and exuberantly greeted with what sounded to be my long lost friend, except that I had never met her. Perhaps they support sampling of their caffeinated beverages?  After looking over their lunch menu I decided against ordering anything. While they were eager to help accommodate my dietary requests in any way they could, their vegan options were very limited.  Ended up ordering a large (because it's that kind of day) English toffee latte with soy. One employee took my order and rung me up while the second FOH employee immediately began preparing my tasty beverage. Pricing was a bit steep (over $6) and I had to make sure I hadn't accidentally wandered into Starbucks, hence 4 stars rather than 5. I'd go with 4.5 stars if I could though (hint, hint yelp) because the service was outstanding.  The espresso beverage itself was also very good. Not quite the ""best I'd ever had"" as the barista assured me, but still quite nice. The froth was very creamy. I am a self-described ""foo foo"" coffee drinker, meaning that I take a little coffee in my cream and sugar, so the strong espresso presence in the drink was a tad much for me, however, I know it would have been perfect for the many coffee drinkers I know. Just something to keep in mind.  Overall the tasty caffeinated beverage, and especially the service, were pretty kick butt good.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"14 check-ins I thought I already posted a review on yelp, but I guess it was on facebook. Anyhow, I like this place because it is not as crowded or busy as other coffee shops. I never come in here in the evening, so this review reflects daytime experiences. Im sure thats not good for the employees though. Anyhow, Ive had the coffee, had the booze(3 dollar rum and cokes!) and the frappes are great, I recommend red velvet cake or almond joy flavors. The bathrooms are clean(code on the door is 2468) the staff is cool, parking is not a problem. The internet has been consistently good. I was here once at night, it was open mic. Some self hating white woman did some routine about how bad white people were and how she hated herself. I spat coffee out my nose and all over my computer screen. The media and our ""education"" system sure has fried people's brains. Anyhow, yeah this place is cool.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I've been here for coffee a couple times now.... Coffee is good, a little pricey at 3.50 for a large. Not sure if refills are free, but they gave me a free one :). As I'm sitting here lots of people are buying the breakfast burritos.... They must be good, but I'm on a coffee diet and did not try them.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I've been trying to expand my coffee experience to include new places.  This week I decided to try Kick Butt Coffee after some decent reviews on Yelp.  I came in on 7/24 and was surprised to see no one was hanging out. You could tell someone really ran with their karate theme as it's prevalent from the decor, barista wardrobe, and product names. I felt it was a bit over the top for my taste and especially here in Austin.  I ordered a large mocha which came to $6.25. This is the most expensive I paid for a mocha in all of Austin. There is a huge red flag if your coffee costs more then a beer.  I would understand some of the costs if the place was renowned and award winning like other local establishments, however that was not the case.  They use an automatic press from what I saw which creates a starbucks taste (that's not a compliment).  Over all I was left leaving a lot to be desired by the atmosphere and coffee. I will not be back.",0
Coffee Shop 36,Really nice atmosphere you must try the walking dead drink at least one time. The bartenders are very nice and very helpful. This is the best place to host an event ask for Mike he is the general manager.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"I'll try my Italian because they offer traditional options :) ""Un droppio espresso con macchiato"" was awesome!  And, excellent service.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"5 check-ins Listed in ""How to avoid SXSW crowds"" - by a true local, North Loopin' Airport Blvd. 5 stars ++++++++  Bottom line: Favorite coffee shop in all of Austin. What can be said that hasn't been already said? It's unique and it's funky as fuck. And I'm all about funky stuff. While some may be put off by the location, I guarantee you I'm not and never have been. The old stomping grounds are just down the road. I'm biased, I like the location. It's central enough. Every time I've been in, the service is extremely friendly and helpful, offering suggestions. I learned a lot one day. The barista asks:  ""Do you want that dirty, filthy or disgusting?"" This is the name for how many shots go into your coffee. 2, 3 or 4? GENIUS!  The treats are going to get me. I finally decided to cave and get one of their awesome cookies. If you have an affinity for some weird thing on a cookie, they have it. Cookie with fruit loops? Cookie with candy corn? Cookie with ruffles chips? And all with clever names, it's safe to say I'm going to have to get one of those cookies every time from now on. They've got breakfast tacos in the morning (pre-made, pre-wrapped for your convenience) and also serve lunch as well. In the evenings they have liquor and beer, and all sorts or quirky events. Someone else said it, and it's true, this is the least pretentious coffee shop in Austin. I've been to a lot of coffee shops. You want touristy, pretentious coffee? Drive south. You want coffee drank by the locals with a touch of weirdness? Here.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"17 check-ins Listed in I'm pretty much a coffee shop expert. To put it in what I'm sure is an unoriginal manner:  Kick Butt Kick's Butt.  Not only do I like the venue and the coffee, the owner Thomas (shame on me for never really interacting to know if it's Tom or not) actually sends entertaining emails that I'm not upset that I signed up for.  That says something for his email marketing, since I do that kindof stuff for a living.  He's super entertaining and deserves great success with Kick Butt.    Thanks for having a great coffee shop!  I updated because there is a bit of a downside to the place... if you go in for coffee and there's a live show going on.. you have to walk in front of the performers... if it's comedy night... you might get called out... if it's poetry night... you might just kinda feel depressed... either way it's super awkward and it's taught me not to go at night if I'm not going to be entertained by whatever's going on on stage.  Bricking off that time that I can really just not go there for fear of awkwardness makes me lower my review. The glorious view from the tables in the front of the shop. Cookie town. I want my coffee on an iceberg! See all photos from Tim Y. for Kick Butt Coffee Music & Booze",1
Coffee Shop 36,Very cool place for a quick stop and fill up. Love it guys. We need one in San Antonio.,1
Coffee Shop 36,This place has good coffee and hilarious Chuck Norris joke posters. That's really about all I can say.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"I really like this place. The coffee is good, and the food as well. Most of all I've enjoyed the service here, everyone seems to be in a good mood.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"This place is off the chain. Stellar service, comfortable ambience and atmosphere, and wonderful original coffee and entrees. I had a chocolate/peanut butter frappé that was to die for! They also have live music nights and support local artists, how can you beat that? Definitely check this place out!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Took a class here with, sorry if I'm wrong, Thomas? The owner, I believe, and the guy is seriously passionate about coffee. It was good for us that attended in our business and as far as the place goes, all I can say is, if I lived in that area, I would frequent the place.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Updated review 8 check-ins after numerous visits, kick butt has changed my mind. i like you kick butt, you're alright. the reason i say this is for 3 reasons. #1 Damn good cookies, #2 Great venue to go watch shows in an intimate setting, also kudos for expanding! and #3 Best baristas, seriously they deserve nothing but good things (like more money)",1
Coffee Shop 36,This is my favorite place to get coffee. The staff are friendly and helpful. Everything I have had tastes great!  Why go to a generic chain when there is something way more fun and delicious available.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"This morning I made my shameful ""half hungover/tired as one young 20-something gal tends to get"" over to kick butt coffee. First of all, let me tell you about the convenient location. Coming from my best friends apartment, it was so close! Which I needed, because typical... I was running behind for work. Less than 10 minutes from downtown and out of traffics reach it made me super pleased! Anyway, I walk in with my smeared makeup and probably giving off a weird odor.. They welcomed me nicely and the atmosphere was awesome! Really chill, and I can see myself going back and just spending hours there! By the way... Order a caramel cafe latte, it was the best latte I've had in awhile... I've been on a hunt for one that actually tastes good. And to all you white girls out there.. Totally beats Starbucks. This coffee shop was... Well, KICK BUTT.",1
Coffee Shop 36,Extremely rude staff and horribly over priced.  I had never been here before and thought I'd give it a try before going into work today. I walk in and notice it has a weird smell. I reached the counter and inform the girls working there that it was my first time going there. They didn't try to give me recommendations or anything they just stared at me as if to tell me hurry up. I ordered an americano and requested a bit of almond milk mixed in. The girl at the counter seemed incredibly bothered with this request and rolled her eyes at me. When she rang up my small coffee and doughnut. I couldnt believe the price. $7 for a basic small coffee and doughnut. Crazy especially since the coffee tasted horrible and I received the wrong doughnut. Needless to say I will never go here again nor will i recommend it to anyone.,0
Coffee Shop 36,"Listed in Jankyness, Ooooh La La What a weird place, and I don't mean that in a good way.  An atmosphere equivalent to drinking coffee at a 22nd century Wal-mart and baristas with the persona to match.  Using the word ""butt"" and a karate kick doesn't fix that.  UPDATE TO OWNER RESPONSE:    Well, Thomas, perhaps you have forgotten about the reviews that say similar things to mine?  Maybe you could respect that not everyone will adore everything about you and your business instead of trying to be dismissive of those people.    Not soliciting for positive reviews (or creepily bothering other Yelpers regarding my review) in whatever manner they can be achieved would be a good idea, too.  P.S.  If anyone would like a screenshot of where Thomas is soliciting for a review, I'll be glad to send it to you.",0
Coffee Shop 36,"Yummy coffee drinks and pretty good breakfast tacos! The smell of the inside is a little off putting, but that may be seeping in from the shady donut store next to them. The guy making the coffee joked with everyone standing in line, and seemed to be familiar with quite a few of the customers. I ordered a black ice with almond flavoring in it. Pretty good! I would be willing to try this place out again, if I ever end up on this side of town again. (Which is rare!)  certainly a good alternative to Starbucks!",1
Coffee Shop 36,"5 check-ins I have to admit the first time I went in here i was NOT impressed. There was a cart overflowing with dirty dishes. The garbage was filled to capacity, the cream and sugar area was sticky and gross. And honestly, the place smelled.  I was pretty put off. I didn't want to go back...but I did. I *must* have caught them right after a rush. While i'm not impressed with their coffee  their lattes are THE BEST I've had in Austin. Hands down. I've had the coffee twice now. I go by around 4pm and maybe that's a strange hour but one time my coffee was luke warm and the next time it tasted burnt. After a wicked crap day I stopped again and said it would be the last time, that's when I got the latte.  + That latte was ordered, paid for and in my hands in less than 2 minutes. Super barista! + That latte was goooooooood + the employees are very polite. + I didn't have to repeat my drink order + there were zero snarky comments when I asked where the 'sugar free' list was (you know who i'm talking about...mermaid logos, attitude problems, over priced everything?)  - not a big fan of the coffee. *might* try that one more time  I don't know if i'll swing by to try and ""adult bev"" any time soon after work but I will eventually and update from there.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I adore this place to work at during the day. I'm excited to see what the expansion of their space means for business.  The comedy open mic on Wednesdays is pretty fun for me, too. It's a great place to get started if you want to try to be funny in front of people. When it's embarrassing, I still enjoy it...",1
Coffee Shop 36,"2 check-ins Love this place! If I lived closer, I'd be here more often. But when I'm in the neighborhood, like getting my car serviced at Subaru, I always make it by. This morning I had the Yummy Chef breakfast taco. What is in that spicy salsa? Wow, that is delicious and so fresh! My chai tea latte was delish, of course, and the people friendly.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"I went in here to get 2 iced coffees and 2 pre-made sandwiches. I had been here before over the years and this time I noticed they have expanded, taking down a wall and taking the spot next door. It looks great. The vibe is hit or miss and the food is average but the cookies and iced coffee are great.  However, something was different this time around. The prices are not good anymore.  My 2 iced coffees to-go and 2 cellophane wrapped cold sandwiches came out to a whopping  $24.51 I really thought the barista said my total was 14 something and we were talking when I was signing my credit card slip.  As I was walking out it hit me; ""did she say 24?""  Lo and behold I looked at my receipt and it was 24 bucks. I returned to the counter and asked the barista how much the sandwiches were and she said ""I don't know, like 6 something and the coffees like 4.50 or 5"" I let it go in the moment but thought I'd share this here with the yelp community and my neighbors in Hyde Park and surrounding areas. Great food, pretty cool staff but L.A. prices on the food is not Austin cool. I won't return but solely for the over pricing. If you're in the area try Corona Cafe, Epochs or Quacks instead.",0
Coffee Shop 36,"Love this place! Love the coffee and service! Why would anyone go any where else for coffee? My fav is the Mocha iced. The decor is very ""Austin"" and a great place to visit if you are new to the city or have been here forever!",1
Coffee Shop 36,They have the worst wifi. I complain every time I come. Fix it please. Just call Time Warner and complain like everybody else.,0
Coffee Shop 36,"I am not in the Airport Blvd/Highland Mall area often, butt when I am I get excited about stopping in for a coffee. I usually go with the iced mocha. This place is always clean, the baristas are not only easy on the eyes but they know what they are doing. Places like this make Austin what it is. It's a unique hybrid of martial arts studio and coffee house with live music occasionally. They even have a big screem tv that plays kung fu movies and they have booths instead of IKEA styled table and chairs like the national chain coffee shops have. Much more intimate, always fast and always friendly. Keep doing what you're doing!  Oh, their pizzas are a handcrafted slice of heaven! Delicious, fresh, handcrafted pizzas.",1
Coffee Shop 36,"Great coffee, the guys that work here have an awesome attitude and are very accommodating. Have to try the breakfast tacos, they are not big but picked with flavor, and taste amazingly! Awesome coffee and breakfast tacos!",1
Coffee Shop 36,Despite the fact that the music can be a bit too loud and the prices are on the high side...KBC makes a mean dirty chai so I keep going back!    The new expansion is great (and was much needed)! There's now plenty of seating and parking is never an issue.,1
Coffee Shop 36,"I could care less about atmosphere; music, dancing, martial arts, creative arts - whatever. I patronize an establishment to get what I need and no amount of frilly curtains or stand up comedy will encourage me to return if my basic needs are not met.  I started out ordering a large latte once or twice a week from KBC but soon discovered that it was close to $7 and I rarely finished it so I quickly cut back to a small. Another employee picks up our coffee order and while I was satisfied with the flavor I always thought it was a little expensive even for the small at over $4. I thought, okay, they specialize in coffee, what do I know, so I kept having my coffees. Today we decided to try out the lunch menu and placed the order by phone using the non-priced online menu.  Never ... let me make that perfectly clear, NEVER will I ever order anything from this place again. I mean, who do they think they are catering to? Location--less than favorable neighborhood near a defunct mall, and in a strip mall no less, in a working class area. Now adding a community college into the mix and this place charges $15.00 for a dammed cold cut sandwich?  Newsflash, they are not an upscale restaurant no matter what they think ... and they are surrounded by fifty places to buy a $6.00 - $7.00 sandwich every bit as good as what they are putting out. Advice from me is, get pricing on everything before you commit. Three people at my work ate lunch today to the tune of $45.00 - three sandwiches, with chips and salsa as sides, two cookies and one small coffee and a 16 oz bottled diet coke. Still in shock. By the way - it might not hurt to get some heat sleeves that actually stay on the coffee cups. What a pain to always have to tape it in place.  UPDATE TO OWNER RESPONSE  I appreciate your prompt and courteous response to my review. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of Bar Rescue and sometimes it seems that so many conflicts could easily be resolved with forethought about location and target markets.  Since yesterday I have read repeated reviews about the prices at KBC but it never occurred to me to check them beforehand as I am in retail and understand about competition and the value of being consistent with other companies that provide similar products and services.  Nobody likes a nasty surprise, so when a customer complains about our pricing I can always respond with, we are competitive, you will not find a similar product cheaper anywhere else.  If you feel your product has a higher value, maybe pricing on the web site would prevent the kind of shock that we went through when we picked up our lunch. Do you sell any sandwich for under $9? if so that would be good information to have beforehand. I don't think any of us paid less than that and we all ordered different things. You cannot always rely on the customer to ask for pricing nor can you rely on remembering to warn them about an unexpected high price.  It's not necessary to treat us all to lunch, although the offer is appreciated. Your web site offers detailed information about your menu, if you could add pricing, that should resolve the issue for future customers. You guys are like right next to the blood bank, this is not a downtown bistro that caters to upper end customers. Offer some affordable lunches for the working class and college students that you are surrounded by. I wish you the best.  Cheers.",0
Coffee Shop 36,"$4.75 for a 20 ounce iced coffee? This is absolutely insane. They also charge $1.00 for a cup of water. I was skeptical to come into this place because of their super corny name and unfortunately I can confirm this place is a waste of time and money. There was also a somewhat strong odor of mothballs when I visited. Considering all of the great coffee options in Austin, it's incredible this place can stay open.",0
Coffee Shop 36,"Under normal circumstances, I'd have given this place four or five stars.  I've been in a few times, and despite a bit of inconsistency in how my drink was made, it was always delicious.  However, last night when I went in for a drink before rehearsal, the barista was extremely unfriendly and unhelpful.  I ordered my usual drink (a soy/coconut iced latte), and he made it hot instead of iced.  I don't like to be a pain with baristas, but the drinks here are just insanely expensive, so I asked him to remake it.  He took the drink back from me, and right in front of me, poured the hot drink over ice.  At that point, I didn't want to interact with someone so rude anymore, so I took it and left.  Anyone who has been through food safety training as a barista knows that it violates health code to pour a hot drink over ice.  So not only was I left with a watered down drink, it was potentially unsafe to consume. Last night, I paid $14 for two lattes and a cookie.  Am I wrong in thinking that $14 entitles me to have my drink made correctly?",0

Coffee Shop 39,"What a sneaky place! I drive by this place every week and never noticed it until Yelp showed it to me!  This place is the epitome of ""HIPSTER."" The cafe is kind of small but there is a lot of tables for students to study on and also a small corner with two futons for those that just want to relax.  I came here twice in the same week and both times ordered the Hazelnut Latte. Double Shot. Hot. They serve it to you in these really interesting long silver cups. The price of their drinks are a little on the expensive side in my opinion but they were very delicious!  There is always one person working but the workers were super nice. They are very patient with you and do their jobs very well. Its not a bad place to study. Everyone usually stays quiet and doesn't make it distracting for others. Around the midday on the weekend, it was pretty packed. So i'm not sure when they're big wave of customers come.  Their outdoor seating is super cute! They have a big tree in the middle and just like a backyard of a house, they put the wooden picket fence around them.  I would definitely come back! double Hazelnut Latte Hot",1
Coffee Shop 39,"6 check-ins I've got three check-ins here but I've definitely been more. Ugh. Sitting here right now and I can't get over how glad I am to have found La Tazza Fresca.  The barista is really nice and friendly, and she has some great drink recommendations. She plays really good music, which feeds the chill, calm, study-friendly vibes.  The decor is great, got that hipster vibe but they don't sacrifice table space for hipsterness, which lots of other places do. Lighting is a bit lacking, but it's not nearly as bad as places like Flightpath, etc.  Space is good--somehow, every single time I've come it's been maybe 75% full but with the perfect large table for me. Hm.  I'm not much of an outdoor-seating person bc I can't focus, but it looks good for meetings and such.  Now, I'm no coffee elitist, so I don't want to make crazy promises about the drinks, but I think they're solid. I've had the Cubano, Vietnamese Coffee, Irish Cream Latte, Iced Almond Milk Latte, and Chai Tea. All great, to me! And I've also had a ridiculous amount of their blueberry and Nutella cheesecake... 10/10 would recommend.  All in all, I'm looking for good, quiet, chill places to study with lots of room and not too expensive drinks, and this is it.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Today happened to be a double dirty chai day (starbucks in the morning, LTF mid-afternoon).  Parking isn't great, but it's worth it if you're staying a while. My iced chai was well worth the frustration of finding a spot! Starbucks tasted like water after trying this. Sooooo yummy with a shot of espresso. Plus, personable (and cute) baristas had me tipping even on a college budget.  The space inside is homey and made me wish I had my homework!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"6 check-ins their iced coffee was incredible! Don't know what it is, but they do something a little different - so good.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"4 check-ins As the semester progresses and my assignments become more tedious..I find myself needing to get away from my apartment for full productivity. This place rocks. Plenty of inside seating for it's size and even more seating outside. The outdoor seating is in three separate areas so if you're wanting some vitamin D, you can chase the sun as it moves around above you.  If you come here without getting a chai tea..you're doing it wrong. Put it on the rocks and make it dirty..then thank me later. Staff is always pleasant and helpful - not snooty like most baristas around Austin. They share bathrooms with the Groovy Lube next door..sometimes the bathrooms are clean, sometimes they aren't. I like to think they're only dirty when Groovy Lube is in charge of the cleaning...but who knows. Dirty iced chai to fuel my writing session",1
Coffee Shop 39,"La Tazza Fresca is a very cute and tiny coffee shop. Indoor and outdoor seating avilable. It does not have loud background music like other places and it is generally pretty quiet. Nice place to study and read.  Coffee is pretty good with very reasonable prcies but tea is alright, sometimes it is too watery.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"My standards for coffee are super low, so the fact that I really didn't like this place is kind of upsetting.  Don't get me wrong, the decor is really nice and it's a cute coffee shop, but I'd prefer getting to drink my latte rather than having to throw it out. If you're just here to study then fine, the lighting is decent and the noise level is fairly low. Although, you might want to look into going somewhere else if you're going to be there for a long time, or if you're a frequent pee-er like me. No lock on the bathroom means I'm not going unless there's someone there to watch the door.  Now getting to the drinks, I ordered a hot white chocolate mocha latte (one plus, this place has tons of different flavors). It was served to me in a thick metal cup which was nice since the cup wasn't too hot to hold. But as a result (or maybe from something else, I'm not sure) my latte tasted like pure metal. I had my friends try it as well, and all they could taste was metal.  I don't know about you, but that's not really the kind of thing I'd like to be drinking. White chocolate mocha latte",0
Coffee Shop 39,"Updated review 2 check-ins Listed in Places to Revisit! Still think this cafe is one of my favs. When studying at home gets too stuffy, and I can't focus, I come here. I actually dropped by on Sunday around afternoon, and it was soooo crowded with a lot of people studying. Music is just right, noise level is perfect, and their iced chai tea is to die for. Sort of tastes like a cinnabon bun in a silver cup. But I also still love their vanilla latte. I had it iced this time, and it was still amazing.  Definitely one of my favorite cafes to study for or chill at and drink some amazing drinks.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"2 check-ins Something that really sticks out to me about La Tazza Fresca is how friendly and approachable the staff are - they are always taking care of their customers and are generally very pleasant to interact with, which I really appreciate.  I love coming here to study late in the afternoon or in the evening, being that it is close to Hyde Park where I live. The atmosphere is a bit dark but comfortable for reading, listening to music or studying. I probably wouldn't come here to socialize but some people do.  The menu is quite large - I've heard their chai is some of the best in town but I have yet to try it. I love the metal cups that their hot tea drinks come in, and have not been disappointed by their coffee. I usually just order a hot latte wherever I go, and theirs is decent. Nothing special though - I like my lattes with a strong bitter coffee flavor, which I don't really get from theirs, but it's nonetheless good.  They also serve a variety of desserts / pastries, and I think a limited range of food options, as well as beers and other drinks, and there is outdoor seating if that's what you like.  Also, and this might just be me, but a nice bathroom is a huge plus at a coffee house, and though their bathroom is pretty rundown, there's a lot of interesting and unique graffiti, which keeps me entertained. (haha)  Overall, La Tazza Fresca is an Austin gem, with a good location, super nice staff, and good drinks. I'll continue to support.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Cutest coffee shop I have ever been to! I'm visiting Austin right now and needed to find a spot to study during the day. And I stumbled upon this spot. It's near UT, so there were several other students studying, but there were also young professionals and people having coffee dates/hanging out.  Plenty of seating. It's pretty easy to find a seat during the morning and later at night. They did have a little study rush when I came in around 5pm...which makes sense since students were coming out of class.  I read so much about the dirty chai, so I tried both the iced and hot versions. It is DELICIOUS. I definitely recommend it. The flavor and espresso are consistent. The chai and espresso work perfectly together. I love how they have their chai powder mix for sale as well!  Service was great! Each encounter with the baristas behind the counter was pleasant - they're patient, kind, and helpful if you need any recommendation. Iced Dirty Chai + chicken salad sandwich with tomato basil soup = great study session",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Iced latte with 2% milk, 1/2 caf & a lil vanilla syrup. Tastes like sweet milk. No coffee flavor. Granted, stays cold long in their insulated mugs.  Which is very much needed on a hot day in August when it feels like there is NO A/C in here.  The atmosphere resembles a European pub. Good tables& fair lighting.  Place feels a lil dirty, though.",0
Coffee Shop 39,"Best iced coffee in town, maybe anywhere. They lightly spice it, not enough to make it taste like dessert, but enough to make it distinctive and crazy delicious.  Also, great music. Eclectic mix. Many of my favorite coffee shops seem to want to play music that drives me insane. (Cherrywood, The Hideout, I'm looking at you.) I've never had to jam earbuds in at La Tazza Fresca though!",1
Coffee Shop 39,Good service.  They ran out of half of the sandwiches on the menu so I had the veggie one.  I was ready to be disappointed but it wasn't bad.  The barista is so nice!  I had chocolate vanilla coffee and that was okay.  But my friend raved about her chai coffee. Gotta try that next time.,1
Coffee Shop 39,"Love this place! I've come here on occasions when I was doing something nearby, and the staff have always been bery friendly, the coffee absolutely delicious! The atmosphere is also quite cozy, and I feel comfortable here unlike other shops which are a bit intimidating or a bit too quiet.  I'm currently enjoying a latte while waiting on my oil change at the Groovy Lube next door. Very convenient!",1
Coffee Shop 39,Best iced coffee in town. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere.,1
Coffee Shop 39,Horrible!! Slow service and no real food menu items. Egg tasted like it was from powder and the bagel was soggy,0
Coffee Shop 39,"Pretty cute place. Nice service, and I love all the antique furniture to sit on. The metal cups are a neat idea, but I personally hate the feel of metal anywhere near my mouth (ie like chewing on foil or clinking a spoon on my teeth), so that's a little downside for me. But they made a great breve latte!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"This place is a little hidden gem.  I would always drive past this place and want to give it a try.  One day, I finally did.  It took me awhile to figure out where the entrance was, but once I did, I was in heaven.  It's a nice relaxing coffee shop.  Every time I've gone, there's been a place to sit.  The music is also very mellow and doesn't distract you from what you're doing.  I would recommend that they get more baristas.  The lines can get pretty long and the wait gets a little crazy when there's only one barista available to fill everyone's orders.  I fully intend to go to this location again.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Updated review 17 check-ins Iced chai latte is my new favorite! I usually DO NOT like chai latte's because they're too spicy or gingery for me but here it's DELICIOUS! So sweet and milky. They also sell packs of their chai latte mix separately for like $7 which I should probably invest in so I can just make it at home. They really just take a scoop of that, mix it in steamed milk, and add more milk until it fills the cup.    Apparently there's also a discount for UT students so WOOHOO! Only one barista's ever mentioned it to me and that was the last I heard of it because they literally never ask.",1
Coffee Shop 39,Meh. That's really my reaction to this place. Ordered a Vietnamese coffee and it was good but WAAAAAY too sweet...like hurt your teeth sweet. I ended up throwing it out and going to Starbucks for a cold brew bc I couldn't bring myself to drink a whole 16oz of that sugary concoction. Usually Vietnamese coffee has a nice bitter/salty undertone to it and this didn't have that at all. Not gonna go back.,0
Coffee Shop 39,"This is a good place, but not great. The food portions are generous. The tuna sandwich was very good. The coffee was just fine too. The barista was as nice as can be. But the cafe isn't what I would consider a comfy place to sit and work. There are a two comfortable chairs, but most of the place is hard seating and tables. There isn't enough room to just relax and  get work done. Plus, it has a rather tense atmosphere exuded by the stressed out students who fill the place. The outside seating is very nice, but I couldn't get a strong enough wifi connection out there to work. I had to wait until someone left inside to get a spot.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Hands down, the best chai in all of Austin! I get mine with almond milk, sometimes dirty, and other times with a shot of vanilla. Iced or cold, it is the best! La Tazza is great to study or read at, but often is usually full with students and can be a little crammed. Worth the visit though!  Other recommendation: Turkish Coffee. Pair it with one of their biscotti. So. Good.  Little secret - the floor looks like random spots but it's actually a giant world map!",1
Coffee Shop 39,Not a bad place to grab a coffee if you are not in a rush to be anywhere. Good place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 39,Bad lighting that made me sleepy. Also my coffee took 20-25 min to come out and I just ordered a simply coffee... There's so many coffee shops in Austin but this is not one I would recommend.,0
Coffee Shop 39,"My favorite of the coffee shops during our travels in Austin (and there were some amazing ones). Had an iced chai latte, and it was pretty easily the best I've had. My husbands iced coffee was solid as well. Guy behind the counter was super friendly, and the place in general was just calm and comfortable. Would totally be one of my haunts were I an actual local.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I love this coffee place cause its divey and, in my opinion, embodies Austin.  The coffee and tea is great, and if it isn't listed on the menu they will still try to make what ever it is you are wanting.  All the baristas are friendly.  Wifi is available, and also an assortment of board games.  It has a vintage and ""Keep Austin weird"" appeal to it.    I have made it a tradition to stop here and get hot chocolate after walking down 37th st to see the 37th st Christmas lights.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I came back to La Tazza Fresca for the first time since college (wow, time flies!!) and I still found it to be as enjoyable as I remembered it. We were visiting for the holidays and I needed a nice, quiet space to relax and recharge before going back to the in-laws... I'm sure someone on yelp feels me on that one.  On an weekend afternoon, it was very mellow and felt as cozy as I remembered. There are tables of all sizes, some couches, and outside tables to choose from. There are a ton of power strips everywhere for people who want to study (why don't other coffee houses think of that). Since it's a little further north of campus, it draws a much quieter student crowd then that of, say, the starbucks in west campus. I think it usually  draws more of an older crowd too, which is nice now that I don't dig the college scene.  I really like the music they were playing: a little piano, a little jazz, a little of generic coffee house singer/songwriter stuff. Mellow and good for getting your mind right.  I think they have an excellent tea list. Peppermint and peach passion are my favorite at this joint. The man behind the counter was polite and helpful, and offered my husband suggestions when it came to the food and coffee. There isn't a big parking lot, but you can park in the neighborhood close by. Or take one of the many buses that pass by!  I sat and enjoyed a few hours of reading a book in peace with a nice cup of tea. If that's what you're into, then I think you'll like this place too!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Oh, how I'd love to actually like this place. Despite the many hipsters that drink coffee and work on their laptops, I do sincerely enjoy the coffee and tea selections. I do NOT enjoy the fact that every time I go to get my coffee of choice I am charged a different price depending on who is working. Nor do I enjoy staring at the back of the person who is to be making my coffee, but is actually just texting away on their cell phone when I only have 15 minutes to be on time to an interview. I shouldn't have to ask you what time it is in order to get you to do your fucking job. Perhaps if you had baristas who actually did their job I could give this place a higher rating, but if I am treated as though I am inconveniencing someone who is at WORK I sadly cannot.  Do your fucking job, baristas. Texting for 10 minutes and wasting your customer's time is TERRIBLE business. You can be certain that the word spreads, so if I were the owner of this establishment I would hire someone who actually cares about being employed.",0
Coffee Shop 39,"I went over there a while ago to get some work done with friends, and after my experience there, I can say with a fair amount of certainty that La Tazza Fresca is a place I'm likely to visit often. It provided a conducive environment to get our work done, and the service at the bar was really great. It's pretty neat that they have games there as well-something to pass the time when we need to take a break, or just great games to play for the sake of playing.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"4 check-ins This coffee shop is a hidden gem on guad. I kind of want to keep it that way, but I shall share it's awesomeness with the Yelp world.  La Tazza Fresca is so cozy and cute! I came here with a girlfriend when we were looking for some late night coffee and dessert and it definitely hit the spot! I got their pumpkin spice latte with soy milk and less sugar (I'm a health freak, I know) and their cheesecake brownie. The latte was delicious! It made for the perfect autumn beverage on a cold rainy night. The brownie was a different story though. It was kind of hard and dry, tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. They were also out of a lot of stuff. I think I asked for 2 or 3 other flavors of latte and finally had to settle with pumpkin, but it all worked out!  Note: It's a pretty small coffee shop so you might not find a space during peak hours if you're looking for a place to study. But if you get lucky, you're lucky because this place is chill. I'll definitely come here to study next time.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Great ambiance, small selection of sandwiches, fast internet. I will definitely recommend it. Chicken Salad Samdwich, comes with free tasty tomato soup.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Admittedly, I have high standards for coffee, but this was terrible. The cappuccino I ordered had virtually no foam, tasted like slightly bitter, watered down coffee flavored milk, and was barely warm. The barista was not at all friendly, engaging just enough to take our money, and hand us the coffee. We will not be back.  *I have updated this review due to the response of the owner to my initial review. She graciously offered a refund, and invited us to come back for a better experience. While that doesn't change my initial experience, I appreciate her caring enough to do so.",0
Coffee Shop 39,"Without a doubt the best cup of plain coffee I have ever experienced.  It has a subtle hint of sweet to it, almost like it was roasted with cinnamon, and is perfect just the way it is.  WARNING: if you are someone who truly likes a strong, slap your grandma cup of coffee flavor, this isn't it.  For the longest time I couldn't drink coffee unless it was loaded with cream and sugar, and gradually I've trained myself to either drink it black or with just a bit of almond milk.  That being said, I find some coffee undrinkable without cream and sugar, but thankfully the coffee at La Tazza Fresca is not one of them.  Literally after my first sip I was hooked, and texted my friends to tell them about the life-changing cup of coffee I've just had.  Does anyone know where they get their coffee from??  Heard they had the best chai latte in all of Austin.  I just moved here a few weeks ago so will have to update my review on this later after I've had more to compare to, but I will say I wasn't overly impressed.  But, as I said, their coffee is wonderful and I'd like to start a fan club page for just the coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"A nice little coffee shop with lots of space (especially when its nice enough to sit outdoors). Reasonable prices and adequate space to get some work done. I got the Turkish Coffee and the girl I was with got a Coconut Vanilla Latte... both were excellent. Wouldn't go significantly out of the way for it, but if you're in the neighborhood and looking for a spot to get some work done or talk over coffee its an excellent spot.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I was trying to kill time while waiting for an audition . Drove up from San Antonio . Emily was amazing . She had a beautiful smile , was friendly to everyone & very knowledgeable about the menu . I'll definitely be back .",1
Coffee Shop 39,"La Tazza has a special place in my heart. It's definitely my favorite study sanctuary in this part of town. The Chai smoothie is heavenly (hang over cure)! And I also love their creamy tomato soup; it's awesome that a cup is included with a sandwich, but I also order a bowl a la carte sometimes. I've had the veggie sandwich a million times and I've never gotten sick of it. I think management does an awesome job hiring their staff because everyone I've ordered from is kind and speedy! This place is an Austin gem. Cucumber avocado sandwich, the best soup ever and a Chai smoothie! :)",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Very old building with its own atmosphere. Think of a rainy day at home, that's what this place feels like. Pastries, limited but still very good. They have a lot of different coffee flavored, smoothies, teas, etc. I got an English toffee latte. One word. Foamy :) oh, and they have a lot of food options.  It's a pretty large cafe with a lot of space, inside and out, but since it's near UT it can get crowded. Choose your time wisely.  I'm coming back to this hidden gem.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Generally crowded inside so if the weather isn't great, good luck finding a place to sit. However, outside has a lot of room so I would recommend sitting outside. Overall, solid coffee and there is a bar!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"This cafe is a regular spot for the Austin Argentine Tango scene on certain Fridays.  As soon as you walk in, you can smell the coffee that is engrained on every surface of this place.  Cute decor and a neat menu with pastries and snacks that you can munch on.  The young man behind the counter was polite and nice - happily providing recommendations when I asked him his opinion on their Italian sodas.  I had the Peach Cream Italian Soda, and I absolutely loved loved loved it.  Their chai was also yummy.  The apple pie a tad too sweet, but that's just me.    Great ambience and the prices are not extravagant either!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Vibe: Cozy and mellow. High ceilings and options for couch sitting, seating at the bar, smaller tables for one or two, or larger tables for 4, 5 if you're just sitting and talking vs. trying to work on laptops. Plenty of outlets. There are even a few outlets outside (though they've never worked for me).  Wi-fi: The have over 6 wi-fi networks to choose from, with options for 5G. Quick connection, but I'm pretty sure my debit card info got stolen when I ordered something online here, so I'd advise doing your online shopping elsewhere if ya wanna avoid the headaches, calls to the bank, paperwork...  Coffee and food: I love their iced chai tea lattes! Very good, especially in comparison to the iced chais at other coffee shops in the area (cough cough Bennu cough). The pie is good when it's fresh! Their smoothies are pretty good too.  Parking: Pretttty limited, but there is street parking in the neighborhood. Not a far walk.  Crowd: if you're going after 5pm during the school year, call ahead to check if there are open tables. Nothing is less motivating then walking in and having to immediately walk out. Mixed crowd, lots of older folks. There's a good number of students here during the fall and spring semesters. Cozy, not cramped!",1
Coffee Shop 39,They have a huge patio for dogs which is great. I should of gotten the coffee but opted for a tea instead. The tomato soup is fresh and tasty. Close to the main road and easily accessible.,1
Coffee Shop 39,"the breakfast burritos are delicious and the sauce that comes with them is straight up life changing.  also yes, the chai is really that good. personally, i order a dirty chai to cut the sweetness a little bit and add some caffeine.",1
Coffee Shop 39,A good coffee shop with a decent special on brewed coffee (Bottomless for around $3.30 + tax; If only they had the same special on beer! ;-) ).  The woman working there was friendly and the ambiance was nice as well.  I wouldn't mind going back there in the future!  The coffee tasted good and it's good overall.,1
Coffee Shop 39,"For years, Tazza Fresca has been my favorite place to go to for reading, work, talking with friends, etc. They put a lot of care into everything they make.  I'm especially happy to see that they recently started selling their chai latte mix. It's the best in Austin! They also have beer and wine and lots of delicious homemade deserts.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Updated review This is my favorite coffee spot in all of Austin.  It just has my desired cozy-ness factor right where I want it. Whether sitting in or relaxing outside while doing my work.  I love the music selection here, the vibe of the place, that they have board games, the lovely staff and the delightful coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Great place to study with plenty of plugs, but limited space. I got the passion peach tea and it was good. I do need to come back for their coffee since apparently after reading a lot of these reviews, they do a little something different with a hint of cinnamon/nutmeg? Well, I'll have to just come see for myself.  Parking was a disaster, but there's neighborhood parking around the area.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I was a regular here while at UT. Oh man, it was sort of embarrassing how often I would be at La Tazza. I'm pretty sure I knew all the baristas. Anyway, the Nutella ganache cheesecake is A+ and I know my cheesecake.  For a coffee-related treat, you can order any of the espresso milkshakes. THEY ARE HUGE and definitely meant to share, but they're just so good. Better than the espresso milkshake at Alamo Drafthouse. Yes. Also the dirty chai latte is pretty much one of the best I've ever had. And I know my chai.  But the reason I keep coming back is because that bottomless coffee is a GOOD DEAL if you need to stay up. They usually play soft jazz or crooners from the 20's--so it's a nice, relaxed vibe. Perfect for studying (most people study there). I feel like you could have a date here, but probably during the summer when there are fewer students. You don't exactly want to be surrounded by college students. Perfect for meetings & tutors & just regulars. The baristas are nice and non-invasive (most of the time) and good at what they do.  Right, so I've gushed enough. I love it for what I needed it for--studying during college. Parking is available in the lot if you go between 6pm and 8pm probably. Otherwise, you can just park on the residential street. It's not bad at all.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"La Tazza Fresca serves DELICIOUS Coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks (teas & italian cream sodas), and food.  Whatever I order here is never less than SCRUMPTIOUS, and the environment is cozy. Ample seating is available: seats at the bar, round tables, square tables, tables for two, couches.  It's a very nice set-up. It's really cozy and inviting and relaxing.  If I had to rate just the food and drinks, I would give it five stars based on trying the following: Tiramisu Latte, Plain Coffee, Herbal teas, Chai Latte, Pesto-Hummus Bagel sandwich, Avocado Sandwich & Tomato Soup, cheesecake  PROS: WI-FI, great food, very friendly service, board games, comfortable seating, background music is lovely and not at all disruptive, patio seating available. Can spend hours working here and manage to be productive, which is often difficult at coffee shops.  CONS: car parking can be difficult, can get crowded inside & can be difficult to find enough seating if you aren't alone, dim lighting, cozy but tiny environment. Temperature inside can be a bit on the colder side when it's cold outside.  BOTTOM LINE: Great service, Great Drinks, Great Environment for working / meeting (in my opinion, La azza Fresca offers the best environment (for working, studying, and/or meeting) of all the coffee shops I've visited in Austin). Wish they were open later!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"This place has no ventilation. When I go to a coffee shop, I want it to actually smell like coffee inside! Every time I've come here it's musty and either smells like mold/mildew, stagnant water, or like they sprayed cleaner for 10 minutes straight. I mentioned it to the barista and she said that they've gotten that complaint before... I had to sit outside because it was so bad, but their outdoor seating is kind of a joke. The seating on the side near the autoshop isn't too bad, but their front patio is just plain ratchet. All of the furniture is dirty, falling apart, and it just looks like a fenced in junkyard. And even with my headphones blasting music I couldn't escape the horrible songs they were playing. As for the coffee, I've had really bitter americanos and a disgusting iced almond milk latte here. It gets 2 stars because it is open until midnight and the space is cozy, despite all of the above.",0
Coffee Shop 39,"9 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost This place has great tasting coffee. Bottomless iced coffees go for $2.90, and the minimum on credit cards is $2.50. Convenient, right? I decided to drink 3 of them between 9pm-12am (when they close). I made a huge mistake. I went to bed at 3am, and now I'm writing this review...at 7am. At least from this one experience, I'm going to say that their coffee is really strong, and that's a good thing.  Pros: LOTS of outlets, can find parking (especially on 37th), free wi-fi, good environment for studying or meeting with friends, friendly staff  Cons: Music was a little loud (and weird selection, IMO), not 24 hours, a little cramped  Tip: You're going to wanna be sure that you have your headphones if you intend on focusing. Since the place is a little cramped, it's easier to hear others' conversations. Snapshot of the counter and a feel of the place",1
Coffee Shop 39,The atmosphere is great. The prices are great. The location is great. But the baristas are self-important and rude if you are not familiar with all of the punctilio of their coffee shop which is supposed to be the center of your world as well.  Makes me glad I am not in the service industry.,0
Coffee Shop 39,"Despite the epic Starbucks gift cardage received over the holidays I decided it was time to change it up. I am a fan of the atmosphere and numerous table options to accommodate various sized groups, but if it's a late weeknight don't expect to find a seat. Everyone is studying around these times and it's very quiet, which I can appreciate. The individual behind the counter was very inviting unlike other establishments I been to. (COUGH EPOCH COUGH) The coffee was delicious and their sodas are light and refreshing (raspberry cream).  What a great little cafe! I'm truly disappointed I didn't come here earlier on in my college career. Good experience and vibes.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Cool little coffee place next to Groovy Lube. I stopped there when searching fruitlessly for the Beware Coffee trailer, which was nowhere to be found. Still, La Tazza was good--a great iced mocha, and a good but not too giant breakfast burrito.  My only complaint was that it was freezing inside, so much so that I left before I really wanted to, and didn't get the second cup I was considering.  The guy working there was nice, and the few folks there were subdued. You can tell that in the evenings it's probably wall-to-wall with students surgically attached to laptops (there were three Mac users among the four other peple there) so I wouldn't expect a seat during prime study times, if that's what you are thinking about.  Still, a cool little place--not up to the awesomeness of the original Halcyon downtown, but enough like it to make you mourn over what's happened to that place.  Lots of outdoor seating, parking is no doubt a nightmare in the evenings also, but was fine at 9ish on a weekday.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I LOVE this cooffe house. I started coming here while my daughter and son were attending UT.

Coffee Shop 39,"First visit: Terrible barista who was very rude. Second visit: Awesome barista who was super friendly.  Atmosphere is great for those who want company while working with very little chit-chatting going around.  The music is mellow with mostly classical and opera playing. The coffee machines are a little loud but I use headphones that cancel most of the noise.  Couch area for casual reading, plenty of tables. Great terrace area which will be nice when fall sets in.",1

Coffee Shop 39,"Great place to come study. I was visiting Austin and came across the place. Tons of indoor and outdoor seating with plentiful outlets and free fast wifi. They serve alcohol as well, but I was there during the day so I did not partake. I think this place is a gem and will be coming back the next time I'm in town!",1

Bakery case Games!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I started frequenting this place during finals because it was open late and had a stress-free environment. My more recent visits have me reconsidering this as my study spot. Customer service is hit or miss. After standing at the counter today for a while without even being acknowledged by the barista, I decided I would rather go hungry than give them more of my business. Completely ignoring a customer with a card in their hand that is clearly eager to buy something is a little rude. A simple nod or ""I'll be with you as soon as I can"" would be appreciated.",0
Coffee Shop 39,"I really like the menu, the people who work here, the desserts, and how much work I get done-but I do have to say that I don't like the consistently bad music they play.  It's too frumpy- like generic classical music, or jazzy hoppy happy songs that make me cringe. I wish they'd put just a little more thought into their playlists but luckily I have my headphones and Spotify.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Updated review 5 check-ins I have zero complaints about the coffee and the baked goods--everything at La Tazza is delicious. Everything is reasonably priced, even with my addition of soy milk to everything. The only thing that prevents me from making this my go-to coffee shop is the music selection. Very often, it's too loud and distracting. Many of my friends have the same complaint. It's really too bad, La Tazza Fresca is an awesome study spot otherwise!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Love this place! Great selection of teas, coffee, espresso, and food. The also have wine and beer! And the soundtrack was on point.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"This is my favorite study spot near my apartment. Everyone is happy here and the music is great for studying. They have a variety of tables depending on what you need but there can be limited seating due to popularity. My favorite drink is for sure their dirty chai. It has a lot of zip to it. I would also suggest their mochas, which taste great with raspberry syrup. My only suggestion is to charge your computer before you go, there's lot of outlets but some tables are in the middle of the place.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"5 check-ins Listed in The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013 As weird as this may sound, I like studying here because I don't leave with a strange smell on my clothes. Even though La Tazza serves food, you don't smell like grease afterwards. Definitely a plus if you're going somewhere after!  This is a great study spot. The location is good since it's not too far from the UT campus and quite close to Amy's and Sno Beach. The tables are big so you can spread your stuff out instead of trying to cram a laptop, books, and a drink on a typical tiny round coffeeshop table. The drinks and food are decent. I've had a lot of their teas and the garlic / feta flatbread. The baristas are always friendly, so that's a plus!  My only complaint is their Wifi. It's great when the coffeeshop is near empty (maybe 3-4 tables) but once it hits noon, GAME OVER. My browser takes FOR-EVER to load and it's really frustrating and unproductive. They have six different Wifis you can connect to and usually ALL OF THEM ARE SLOW. It's seriously mind boggling.  Okay I lied, I have another complaint - PARKING. Their little driveway next to Groovy Lube only fits 4, maybe 5, compact cars. You have to double / triple park in the driveway. There is street parking but you'd have to come early to find a decent spot.  I would definitely recommend coming early (10AM) so you can find a parking spot, table, and Wifi that doesn't take 2 minutes to load a webpage.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"32 check-ins La Tazza serves up quite the tasty brew. i'm sure they add cinnamon/nutmeg or some sort of spice to their coffee because it smells divine! Plus, refills are only $.50!  I somehow always end up studying at a table where the display of pastries and baked goods are in full view. I honestly don't know how much longer I'll be able to resist the beaconing of the chocolate cake with oreos... I do appreciate their wide variety of sandwiches, cookies, muffins, cakes, and other pastries though!  The one con to this place is they tend to keep the temperature on the warmer side. Even though have several ceiling fans running inside, the brutal Texas summer heat is hard to escape.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"OK, this review is based on basically one experience, but for a coffee shop this is the kiss of death.  I went in there to get a coffee to go and a quick bite for breakfast, which I needed to wolf down to go to an appointment just up the road.    The major issue was the coffee, which I didn't even sip until I stepped outside.  I asked for a small black coffee, and the very nice barista who this review is totally not about because she was great gave me what appeared to be a small black coffee, without comment.  But when I tasted it, it was clearly flavored.  I turned right back around and went back inside and asked her if the coffee was flavored, and she said yes, they brew their coffee with cinnamon and blah blah blah.  That means that at La Tazza Fresca the default coffee is flavored.    The default.  Coffee.  Is flavored.    The look of horror on my face must have been something because the very nice barista offered me a free americano instead, which I took, and it was fine.  But offering flavored coffee as a default brew is a coffee foul.  The default coffee should be unflavored. If flavored is offered at all it should be offered separately, by request.  And if your default coffee IS flavored you should warn people, like when they order a small black coffee company policy should be to respond with, ""Sure thing, but we must warn you that our coffee is flavored because our default assumption is that anybody who orders a small black coffee must have just turned 15 and also it's Christmastime all the time at La Tazza Fresca so merry fucking Christmas.""  Anyway, yeah.  Oh, and for what it's worth, the pastries looked uninspired and mass produced and when I asked where they came from, the barista said they were from a grocery store, which did not inspire confidence.  I got a samosa instead, which honestly was not very good at all --- not crispy, not flavorful.  So my limited exposure to their food was not great, but the rest might be gold, I dunno.",0
Coffee Shop 39,"Listed in Coffee Shops for Writers It's not surprising that so many Yelpers say that La Tazza Fresca is a great place to study.  I love to work here because of the big tables, comfy chairs, and the nice outside patio (when it's not too hot).  Importantly, La Tazza serves decent coffee (and the never-ending cup is only $2.90), beers, and a range of bagels and sandwiches to keep you going.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"This is an Austin gem. If you're not getting your oil changed at Groovy Lube and relaxing at La Tazza Fresca instead of a gross garage lobby, you're doing yourself a disservice!  This is a fantastic coffee bar with a full menu of soups, sandwiches even pizza. All prepared in house. Pastries are delicious and fresh; great breakfast choices too.  Full coffee menu as well as a great wine selection. All that while my oil is changed?  Yes please!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Great dog friendly patio! The drip coffee I had was excellent... it had some sort of undertone that reminded me of christmas... not flavored or sweet- just a hint of something the beans might have been roasted with. I only give it 4 stars because I have only been once, but I will definitely be going back and probably will update soon. They had a great looking interior that will be perfect for grad-school-binders. Looking forward to going back!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Best coffee shop in austin but man it can get crowded! The only option I see to improve it is to add a double decker ""bunk bed"" style second floor that would definitely fit the decoration. Good food, weird good music, very affordable. Long live LTF.",1
Coffee Shop 39,Cool studying spot. My girlfriend is a coffee fiend and she really likes the coffee here. Although she says it's inconsisent. Atmoshpere is great. Great music. Just wish they had more outlets and indoor space. Don't try the breakfast burritos and you're good. The vibe alone makes it worth it.,1
Coffee Shop 39,"I was able to finish writing my thesis because of La Tazza's existence.      Bottomless coffee and a great atmosphere.  If you're a student looking to get away from campus, seeking a non-silent but non-loud place to study/read, this is a good option.  If you're wanting a chill place to chat with a friend, this is still a good option.  (They also serve wine and hookah, though I never came for those).  A few times, my roommate and I would play a game of chess while waiting for our laundry next door.    I must say the ambiance is better than the coffee, but I still put this place at the top of my list.  As far as food goes, the Tomato Basil Soup (which comes with a piece of toast) was tasty on multiple occasions. I've tried both their hummus sandwich and egg salad sandwich -- both good, but I prefer the egg salad.    As a loyal patron, I was going to give 5 stars, but on more than one occasion, I had a difficult time finding parking, only to later find that the search wasn't worth it because it was too crowded to find a good seat.  Afternoons/early evenings are better.    But to end on a positive note, free wifi!",1
Coffee Shop 39,Wow. Seriously the BEST chai latte ive ever had. I'll definitely be returning to this place!,1
Coffee Shop 39,"Awesome coffee shop! Reasons why include: kind baristas, jazz music usually playing, strong drinks, a million flavor options for flavored drinks (even though I always get the same one, I check out the list every time just in case I decide to get wild and go with the smores flavor or etc), cozy, and the prices are fair. The food looks tasty although I've never eaten there. Oh, and I love that the house coffee has a hint of cinnamon flavor! The main reason I'm writing this review is to say how awesome Colin is!! One night around closing time I was a little nervous about walking home (which is almost the closest apt to tazza, but there was a homeless man and a probably-not-weird-incident that I turned into I'm-gonna-get-mugged and I know this homeless man is probably actually very nice but I was carrying expensive electronics), and he offered and walked me home!! Very kind of him!",1
Coffee Shop 39,"La Tazza Fresca is one of my favorite places to study in Austin. Granted, it is only a block away from my house, yet I still prefer it over most other coffee shops.  It is pretty small, eclectic, and they have a nice outdoor seating area as well.  They have a huge menu, and everything I've had has been delicious.  Pros: - Best latte I have ever had, EVER. They have an absurd amount of flavors, and all of them are amazing. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry latte. - Plenty of outlets, you'll never have to compete for one - Relatively quiet, but not silent. Usually soft, unintrusive music playing. - Soft lighting, comfy couches, and regular tables - Bottomless coffee/ice coffee for $2.95  Cons: - Service is iffy. Some cashiers are really friendly and fast, others are somewhat rude. - Only open until midnight - Drinks are expensive, especially tea (over $3 for hot water and a tea bag? Really?) - Parking lot is tiny. There is free neighborhood parking but only at night and on the weekends.  General comments: - I haven't had any of their lunch food, so I can't speak to that.  Their pastries are always amazing. - Their regular coffee has a definite spice component to it.  It tastes especially cinnamon-y, so if you don't like cinnamon you probably won't like their coffee.  Warning: La Tazza offers hookah as well, although I rarely see people actually smoking it and I think they make you sit outside if you do want to smoke.  If you're bothered by hookah, I wouldn't recommend studying here.  La Tazza is a great place to study, or just grab a coffee and catch up with your friends.  It is much quieter and calm during the day, while at night it gets packed with college students studying right up until midnight.  I wish it wasn't quite as pricey as it is.  However, I will be back.  Update: I had their bagel with hummus today and it was AMAZING!!! I can't even express the joy I experienced eating it. It was made with pesto hummus, olives,  onions and a side of tomato soup for dipping.  Jaw drop.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"Updated review 4 check-ins Have to downgrade La Tazza Fresca a bit, though I still like it.  In probably my first 5 visits, I was twice hassled by a sketchy homeless man for money, though in one instance the man running the coffee bar was on him in a flash and escorted him out. In the other instance, another worker just stood behind the bar while the guy went to every table, never doing a thing.  A woman I talked to while there one day told me that she had been threatened by a very aggressive homeless woman there, and that a worker got into an altercation with the same woman.  In those same 5 visits, the shop was not open twice when it was supposed to be... once it opened about a half hour late, the other time it was closed for painting (though it hadn't been posted ahead of time, as I'd been there).",1
Coffee Shop 39,"17 check-ins This is my favorite cafe in town!  I'm a hot-fruity-herbal-tea kinda' girl, and Tazza has an excellent selection with the Wild Berry as well as the Raspberry flavors.  And years ago, a friend talked me into trying a Soy Chai Latte here claiming it tasted like ""the nectar of the heavens"" or some such thing, and I've been getting one every visit since.  So good.  I get it hot since I like the foam, and soy since I'm now non-dairy, but it's good hot or cold, and with any milk.  I've preached its wonder to many a friend who are all now true believers.  Just tastes like magical happiness. They also have a hummus plate, which doesn't come with just hummus and pita, but an array of goodies like cheesy pizza crust, a spanakopita, a samosa, some olives and feta and other stuff, and it's only $7. They also have sandwiches and pizzas a soup; I've never had any of these items, but I think it's lovely that they're all offered. Always a nice ambiance, and great eclectic and quirky music selection, plus a nice and laid back staff.  And the dessert display is always filled with amazing goodies.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Always.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"2 check-ins Listed in Hidden Gems, Caffeine High, Texas Hold Em' I figured out during my brief visit to Austin that the best time to visit LTF is early in the morning on a weekday.  Since it's near the north UT campus, NO ONE is around.  I remember those days of sleeping until 12pm on a Friday...I can't say I miss them.  Now that I have become an early riser in my early 30s, I enjoy a place that is empty.  Such a delight.  The coffee here is truly great.  I ordered a simple iced coffee with cream and sugar, but the coffee had this amazing flavor that I couldn't quite pin down.  Then I realized it was nutmeg!  They put nutmeg in all their coffee and it is delicious.  I am now all about putting it in my morning coffee thanks to LTF.  And the atmosphere is so darling.  Very indie-coffee-shop-with-art-for-sale-everywhere kind of vibe.  And they have an adorable side patio for sitting and sipping.  Ironically (and unfortunately) there is a Starbucks directly across the street from LTF, but avoid it and support the mom and pop.  Your tastebuds will thank you.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"LTF is one of my favorite cafes in Austin.  Pros:  Location - Centrally located with a decent amount of parking. The parking lot fills up sometime, but usually you can find a spot on a side street within walking distance.  Coffee -The coffee is some of the best I've had in Austin. I can drink the drip coffee black (it's flavored, but strong and good), and the cappuccinos and lattes are outstanding.  Food - I've never been disappointed with their sandwiches or smoothies. The pizza is pretty good too. The pastries and baked goods can be really tasty depending on what day it is.  Service - The baristas are usually very polite and quick to serve. Most of them are friendly and have inviting personalities.  Environment - The music they play is unique, eclectic, and entertaining. It's never too loud or obnoxious and gives the place a good atmosphere.  The furnishings are also eclectic and mismatched, giving the place warm and home-like feel. Plenty of outlets for your laptop. The multiple patios are great for hanging out or studying on cool days.  Cons -  Food - The pastries and baked goods are inconsistent. Sometimes you get something really good and fresh, sometimes you get something really dry and stale that should have been thrown out and replaced a few days ago.  Environment - LTF is really popular during school sessions int he evening and midday on weekends. This isn't really a con in itself, but it's often hard to find a seat indoors and can get obnoxiously loud during peak hours. Honestly, this usually doesn't bother me, but it can be annoying if you're just looking for  a place to chill. Also, the outdoor patio furniture is pretty cheap and often dirty. Not awful cheap/dirty, but enough to lower the quality of the outdoor environment.  Summary: Overall, this is my favorite coffee shop in Austin. The coffee is amazing and the environment is great for talking with friends are studying. There's room for improvement, but most of its faults are minor and worth overlooking.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"The place was kind of messy, but WOW was the coffee good!  Don't be the sucker who stands in line at Starbucks across the street. Get a cheaper, faster, and WAY better cup of coffee from this local business.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"2 check-ins Great study spot.  I ordered an iced Cafe Zino, which I had never seen before (espresso pulled through brown sugar) and it was great. Lovely bold flavor with just enough sweet, and I usually take my coffee black. Cozy decor makes for a nice atmosphere with comfy couches and sweet art along the walls. 5/5 for service alone! The barista was sweet and friendly, and brought drinks to the table which was really nice.  Only complaint is that it's hard to find. There isn't a visible sign (I hear it's blocked by trees) so know that it's adjacent to Groovy Lube, this could have saved me a little confusion.  Overall I had a positive experience and would recommend!  Edit: Several (5?) hours later and I am still here. Would like to add that the mix of jazz and swing playing over the loudspeakers is a welcome change from the distracting garage punk/indie goop that is so often heard at other popular study spots (not dropping any names but *cough cough* rhymes with Renooh).  Also, the hummus sandwich is yummy. The soup that comes with it was decent.  Editing again: Hookah too! Wow, this place just gets better. I'm totally giving that a try next time.",1
Coffee Shop 39,"I'm not proud to admit it, but my momma raised me to be a total coffee snob. I have no clue what the food tastes like, but gee-whiskers do they have some great coffee!  Wow.  I don't know what it is that makes it a little bit different from other places, perhaps the pink-haired barista, the plethora of comfy seating, or the hint'o'cinnamon in the brew.  Maybe a triple threat?    Top of the line coffee and an atmosphere full of nerds.  Love it.  They have speedy internet access - thus allowing me to draft up this review whilst working on my code- and plenty of table-top room for my laptop and coffee!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The staff is great here. There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be quiet, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Really cool place! I had a meeting scheduled here by someone, and I am so glad they did. Great vibe and atmosphere! Highly recommend!  This is a gem!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I'm not sure what I did to the workers at this Epoch but they never give me more than 1-word answers and indifferent service. I went in yesterday to order a pour over (overpriced at $5). The cashier took my order and walked over to the area where they make pour overs. I tried to strike up a conversation and got 1-word answers. The barista and other cashier interactions were the same. They were very friendly to some people that appeared to be regulars so maybe it was just me. The Ethiopian pour over was fine but other coffees I've had were nothing special, certainly not enough to make me return anymore. I should've just kept driving down the street to Genuine Joe's, my regular joint that always has good coffee and friendly service.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Wifi is fast!  Mocha's cinnamony and sweet. Not my style but I'm sure it is for some.  Latte is pretty low on that sharp espresso taste, kinda asleep.  Just the one men's toilet and there was a line with maybe 25% of the place filled - if you walk in and this place is full you better be leaving with that coffee!",0
Coffee Shop 20,The fella with he big beard and glasses sold me on the Ethiopian V60 pour over. I'm not a big fan of coffee but this man sold me on the best cup of joe I've ever had. I'll be returning again! Thank you for being so kind and patient. The world needs more people like you! Ethiopian V60 pour over!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I'm not from Austin, but I've been to more than few coffee shops here. When I'm staying in North Austin, Epoch is my new fave. There's plenty of space, a back area with tables, and super fast wifi. Like legit. I went to another spot in east Austin and they were rocking dial up...like for real. I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly. What more do you need when you're writing/studying/on a blind date? It's comfortable and the coffee is great. Check it out next time your in north Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Easily my favorite coffee shop in the entire city.  Had a couple friends come in town, so I couldn't wait to take them there as they are both huge coffee fanatics as well.  Unfortunately, this time the service was less than acceptable.   The guy working the counter was clearly pissed off about working this day, and made sure that everyone ordering knew it.  I gave him my order and afterwards, he just looked at me, then told me the total, without ever acknowledging what I asked for; and same with my girlfriend. My friends were behind us and were ordering next.  They had never been here, and wanted something cold since it was so hot outside.  They tried ordering a ""frappucino"", and they got snapped back that they don't have ""frappucinos"".  They asked if they had something similar, and he said ""yeah, we have the ""blended"" drinks.  When they asked about what flavors were available, he said ""the sign is above you"".  They had never had Horchata before, so they asked what it was, and he responded ""it would take too long to explain what it is, so it is basically a cinnamon flavored coffee drink"".   Very disappointed with the service on this most recent visit, but at least the coffee drinks were great as always; just embarrassing to ""show off"" my favorite coffee place to out of town friends and get this type of visit.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"7 check-ins Love this place! Excellent Americanos. Great layout, cozy and warm decor, always friendly baristas, patio seating out back. A small cozy bar as well.

Coffee Shop 20,"Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This coffee place is a hidden gem in North Austin.  Think a cross between Mozart's and ""your local"" where people know you and actually talk to you.  They don't just ask your name.

Coffee Shop 20,This place is busy busy. I see why now! The coffee is good and cheap!!! It seems too busy and crammed though. Not a type of study place to go too if you're looking for quiet. There are tons of tables and plugs for your laptop/charger though. Baristas were friendly.,1

Coffee Shop 20,"I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.  The barista was so sweet and patient with me and all of my questions. ""What's good here?"" ""Do u have vanilla almond milk?"" Ect. The drink was made in a jiffy with a beautiful latte leaf design to go. I will definitely be coming back soon.",1

Also the baristas that were jerks seem to be gone. The coffee is even better.  Seems like they're made a lot of positive changes, which is why I wanted to do this update!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins.",1

Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em Overall there's nothing wrong with this place. This one-time rating is based mainly on the cranky barista.  SERVICE I don't like to hand out 2-star reviews just based on service but man, this guy was so verbally passive-aggressive I wanted to just hand him a stack of post-it notes so he could write down his thoughts rather than muttering them under his breath in a way we both knew I could still hear him.  AMBIANCE Bumpin 90's R&B like yoooo that Destiny's Child and Tupac!! There is a good amount of seating but a lot of people were there studying as well.

A pot of tea is $4, and I settled on a warm genmaicha to counter the cold and misty weather outside.

Coffee Shop 20,"I just edited my review to 0 stars cuz the guy at the front harassed me and RUDELY came over and said ""did you need to order???"" And I said I already had a drink and he was like ""not since I've been here and we're getting busy........."" And that was the most rudest thing I've ever encountered with a business like how many drinks do u want me to get when I go somewhere??? I understand it's a business, but I already ordered something! Horrible employees! This guy had a typical weird austin beard and glasses. This place is a joke. I asked him like am I supposed to order after a certain period of time? Like what is this, buy 1 thing every hour? I've gone to a lot of places to study and this is gross customer service. I think he thinks I'm lying about getting a drink earlier, but that's HIS greedy little problem not mine!  I got a chai tea latte with almond milk and 3 splendas. It didn't come with one of those pouring thingies, I guess that's just for the regular plain teas. The drink wasn't hot like I like it. Right when I brought it to the table I could drink it right away and considering it was so cold outside I really wanted it hottt, but it wasn't at all so that was pretty weird..they need to turn up the heat on their machines. I gave this place 4 stars cuz of the prices! Holy moly, my small cup was $4.25!! Too much. The music is loud. Chai tea latte - almond milk and 3 splendas (made up a healthier version).",0
Coffee Shop 20,"118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art.

Coffee Shop 20,"This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I keep giving this place a shot over and over hoping it will get better...but it doesn't. Keep in mind I drink black coffee. I hate anything in my coffee, so if you're looking for mochas or lattes, my review probably won't help you.  My iced and hot americanos were disgusting every time I ordered them. They looked like dirty water, and tasted worse. I tried the iced coffee thinking maybe I'd just stay away from the espresso. It's not much better. For some reason both the americanos and iced coffee have a horribly bitter/I-don't-even-know-how-to-describe-it taste. It's not a flavor in coffee with which I'm familiar. And I've worked in two coffee shops and been drinking coffee since long before I should have started.  I'll admit that while I do appreciate certain coffees more than others, I'm able to appreciate/stand pretty much any coffee, anywhere. I had to throw out my almost-full iced americano, and the others I drank more of basically because I was there with a friend, I paid for them, and I knew that they weren't going to make them any better. But I didn't finish any of them.  I'll also agree on the comments about the attitudes of the employees. I often feel like I'm an inconvenience to them.  The only reason I keep coming here is because I meet a friend about once a week, and she likes this place (for the mojos) and it's a good in-between meet-up. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to request a new meeting place.  If you're in the mood for tea, however, go for it. Even if you're not...go for it.",0
Coffee Shop 20,3 check-ins Great coffee and espresso. Above average wifi. Lots of seating. Not enough power outlets. OK outdoor space.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Listed in Coffee Houses We were visiting our friends in Austin and we stopped in to grab coffeee. The parking lot was super busy too. We walked in and the coffee shop has a ton of room for people to meet up/study. I got the Chai latte and they make their own Chai which isn't as sweet as others. I really liked it and we sat to chat for a while.  If I was still a student in austin, I'd probably come by here to study. My student-self was looking at all the tables and outlets.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Cute location and relaxed feel if you want to get away and have a nice secluded conversation with a friend. Nice couches and plenty of tables for studying and enjoying all the lovely items Epoch has to offer.  Epoch served me my FIRST cappuccino and I'm HOOKED! Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second steeping on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again. I wish there were more laid back/spacious coffee houses in San Antonio! Austinites are SPOILED! My first cappuccino! Oh so good!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Great collection of espresso, don't forget to check out their tea selection! They have one with pecan, and it's just delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee, great location. Lots places to eat after. Had a  croissant that was fairly hard, so wasn't impressed with pastry selection. Study spot wise, it depends on the people working that day. There seems to always be louder music playing, and not the kind you can easily tune out, with certain people working. Genuine joes us better for studying on those days, even though its smaller.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Updated review Still love this place! We went in November when it was delightfully nice out and had a couple of vanilla lattes outside and it was really great.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee, tea, and good food.  I'm a big fan of East Side so I of course loved their pizza.  No issues with the staff or Internet.  The parking can be a little weird with the theater next door but that just means a bit further of a walk.  Ultimately the 5 stars come from the fact that there's nothing around it to compete.  Starbucks is ... well, you know.   Genuine Joe experiences have been mixed.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"""Service""? Hahaha. These baristas are the stereotypical holier-than-thou jerks people make jokes about. The coffee is fine, but personally I prefer not to patronize businesses where I'm clearly seen as an annoyance just for ordering.  The other location isn't much better. Starts at the top, I guess.",0
Coffee Shop 20,Not much for decoration or atmosphere... But this cup in front of me might be the best cup of coffee I have ever had.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"Love finding coffee spots. After a disappointing dinner at Korea House, we headed over here for some tea. I ordered a Coconut Chai tea (only comes in a pot). The Barista was really friendly. I loved the cozy feeling of the area. Thanks Austin! Coconut chai tea",1
Coffee Shop 20,So much improvement!!! This place has totally turned it around since they opened. That was rocky. Now it's lovely. The staff is great it's clean. Drinks are on point. Great job guys. Oh and the bottled water helps support drug and alcohol recovery so that's awesome!,1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been a regular to Epoch for about a year now, so this review isn't based on one visit:  Pros: -Coffee is great. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good. -Staff is nice and smiles all around -Wifi is really dependable -Their tables are big! If you like to spread out when you study, come here. -Usually you can find a place to sit at the tables, bar or couch -Love the hipster atmosphere and artwork  Cons: -This place is COLD. I don't mean kind of chilly bring a sweater. I mean after one hour your fingers will be ice and you will be chilled to the bone despite wearing a peacoat. The best tables are lined up on the wall and the air conditioning blasts right on them. Sitting at a table that isn't on the wall helps but definitely doesn't solve the problem. Every time I come here I bring a sweater, but nine times out of ten I have to leave before I planned because I couldn't stand how cold I was. If you're a small or naturally cold person, DO NOT come here or plan to be here for more than 30 minutes. Earlier this morning it was 50 degrees outside and they still had the air conditioning on -- I left earlier than I wanted to.  I really want to like coming here, especially because it's so close to my place, but I just hate how cold it is.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"If you ever are looking to grab a cup of coffee you should give this place a try at least once. I have not had many things here as I feel the only thing I need is the Iced Mojo, but based purely on the Iced Mojo itself I highly recommend it. No need for creamer or sugar it is good to go!  The staff/employees do provide the service expected but do not go above and beyond.  Cozy environment, not as hipster as some of the Epochs closer to downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Good coffee- the baristas were great. I use to be a barista so when I get a taste of a good cup of black I really appreciate it. The energy seemed a bit lacking in the atmosphere this morning. But that could just be me, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I've been coming here for a few years now. They have a great selection of coffee and tea. It's pretty mellow in here so it's ideal for working or studying. Employees are pretty nice overall, hard to beat.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Pretty nice place here, very good environment for studying if you can in a coffee house environment. I got some coconut chai tea without milk and it cost around $4. The only complaint I would have was that after I finished the tea, there were these little bugs flying around and into my cup and it was a bit disgusting. Other than the fly problem, it was pretty good place and tea. The flies are an easy problem to get rid of. Coconut Chai Latte",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Just have to say that I stopped by Epoch because Genuine Joe doesn't understand the concept of staying open during their posted times and how that affects customer service.    So my g/f and I walk in and the place is packed, but the line is small.  Apparently this was the place to be on a Saturday night.  We walk up to the counter and the barista was super nice.  Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"4 check-ins That area needed a good coffeehouse and this was it. I was sick and tired of going to a coffeehouse which I'm going to name but I'll give you a hint - they have private events scheduled and they will kick you out of the room. Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot. If I'm in the area, this is where I'm going to get some good coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I like this place, even though I've recently sworn off caffeine (mostly). The service is nice and the selection of teas and snacks is good. I got a burnt (like, ""why did you think it was okay to put these ingredients into the tortilla?,"" burnt) breakfast taco, emailed them (nicely!) about it, and they gave me a gift card to apologize.  I do wish they could better control noise, and have more outlets for laptops, but if you go prepared with headphones and a full battery you'll enjoy your experience.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Love this place. I usually get the mocha with almond milk. Always good. They serve Tyson's breakfast tacos in the morning. Baristas are always friendly. Plenty of tables and wifi. Great spot to chill or get out of the office.,1
Coffee Shop 20,"I have been to this place a couple of times -- usually Saturday afternoons.  I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.  Overall, pretty good -- but definitely not the end all.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"292 check-ins My neighborhood was low on local coffee shops, so I was thrilled when Epoch opened a new location right around the corner. I like the original location ok, but this one suits my style a bit more. (Yeah, I know, I'm a bit of yuppie.) They also display local artists work.  There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back. The baristas are always friendly and willing to debate you on which Star Wars movie is best, plus they make a mean cortado.  NOTE: They FINALLY fixed that second door in the ladies room a couple months ago.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"This place had a cute atmosphere, plenty of comfortable seating, extremely amiable staff, and just a generally pleasant place to work. Unfortunately I have to dock it for it's coffee though. I haven't tried everything, but the few drinks I've had were ok at best. I haven't tried the food or the tea so I'm not reviewing those, but I do wish the coffee were better. That being said, I like sweet drinks so if you don't, then you'll probably like it more than I did.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Edit: I left 30 minutes in because the music was so horrible and loud. It was old-timey country at first, but abruptly turned 80s alternative. The first song in that sequence was Buffalo Bob's transvestite song in ""Silence of the Lambs."" This is more of a place for people in their 30s or 40s.  First off, this is in a really cool little area. It's right next to Alamo Drafthouse on Anderson (which also means that parking is hopeless). It's part of a community of businesses centered around this leafy garden thing.  It's small, but not comfy. Lighting is poor, but people seem to be studying here with some success. The first two chairs I tried sitting in were wobbly/off-balanced. It's as hot as it is outside, but thankfully a little less humid. Unfortunately, I forgot my headphones, so I'm forced to listen to old-timey country. I probably won't be coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Good place. Got italian soda and fruit and hubby got the iced cappuicunio. Caramel sounds good.

Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp Challenge, Coffee addicts, step up! What the F is a cortado? I didn't know, so I ordered it. And surprisingly, I liked it. I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.  However, I like coffee, the W. Anderson Lane area, and Topo Chico :-)",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost In comparison to the original Epoch, I'm a huge fan. There's parking, open tables, and light! And the bathroom doesn't scare you. High fives all around.  I'm still a fan of the other Epoch, but this one suites me a bit more. They offer Cuvee coffee and will brew it up via Chemex or Clever. The drip coffee is cheap, and refills are only $1. The mocha here is still good, but you can only go Mexican mocha. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups. There's some nice couch space  and bar seating here also. The wi-fi can be spotty though, so that's one knack on it.  Solid shop.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"My favorite coffee shop. Pros: lots of room, comfy seating, 2 very strong wifi networks, a patio, often good music is playing, like Jeff Buckley, instead of that horrible coffee house music you get in places Cons: pastry selection isn't very broad, dine-in cups are so wide that the coffee goes cold quickly",1
Coffee Shop 20,"So- I love coffee shops.  I especially love coffee shops with sofas ( really the only way to work). I love a barista that can make a really good latte. I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"8 check-ins Circa13 is everything a coffee shop should be.  Plenty of places to sit and talk/work. Numerous power outlets, free WiFi and open until Midnight.  They brew up several local teas, Cuvee coffee and serve baked goods from Russell's Bakery. Also serve salad/sandwiches from 10AM-2PM for lunch but I haven't had the chance to try them yet.  Woohoo!

Coffee Shop 20,"21 check-ins ROTD This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

Coffee Shop 20,"Updated review My opinion of this coffee shop has declined somewhat since my original review.  A few notable bad experiences:  - Standing and waiting for the barista to serve me, even though there was no one else in line.  I had to finally say ""excuse me, can I get some service?"" to get said barista to do his job. -  Ordering a coffee, only to find -- they're out of coffee.  This has actually happened a few times.  I had to wait for them to brew a fresh batch. -  Some days, the coffee tastes like watered-down swill.  Other days, it's delicious.  This place happens to be right around the corner from where I work, so I keep giving it chances.  Wish the staff would get it together.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"Four stars means that I liked it AND I'm coming back here preferentially when in the area :)  Because there are no coffeeshops in North Austin as awesome as Epoch and as accessible!  The coffee, tea, and food selection is good, but that's not why you come to Epoch!  You come here because you need some downtime, maybe on a couch, with some wifi and isolation.  Or you come here because you need a quiet place to chat with a friend or three.  Or you can come here to play games with folks.  It all works at Epoch.    I no longer have to drive 30 min to get to North Loop and Guadalupe--halleloo.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"10 check-ins Listed in Coffee Thursday This place is very different from the North Loop location, but not in a bad way. It's just different. There's lots of seating with 2 top tables, bar seating, and a section with couches and armchairs for relaxin'. When I got there, nobody was at the counter for me to order but he popped out from the back after a bit and apologized. Genuine smile, so, of course, he was forgiven.  I always get the Mexican mocha or an iced Mojo from Epoch so I got the Mexican mocha to see how this one compared to the original location. Crazy tasty!  This location has a more modern feel to it than the other location, which is nice...I like having diversity without having to sacrifice deliciousness! They'll get another star out of me when they increase they're bakery/food options! Can a girl get a danish or a piece of cake??",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here.",1
Coffee Shop 20,Their iced mojo is amazing. The shop is spacious and the servers are wonderfully personable. I love this coffee shop.,1

Coffee Shop 20,"I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"Their espresso is vibrant and juicy, they insist relentlessly on quality ingredients, and I have never had a negative experience with any of the staff. I really like the wide space available and it is a calm, sedate place - not crammed with noisy meetings or unsupervised children. They have organic almond milk available! I really love coming here before work to focus my thoughts or work quietly on a project. It's amazing to be here in the early hours especially, and I love having this charming little space in the neighborhood.",1
Coffee Shop 20,"I love this Epoch because I've never had to ""wait"" for a table to open to sit down. It's pretty spacious! I used to live in Far West and hated traveling a little further to my other favorite coffee shops.  I'm not a sucker for coffee but I enjoyed my almond milk iced lattes and hot teas!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"- Great place to study - Great Coffee - The customer service does not meet my expectations though.  This place is a great place to study or work on anything. There are a lot of tables that are available before the evening and is pack usually at night. When I came there, it was empty and there were several places to study. During this time, I didn't purchase anything yet. When it started to get more busier, one of the cashier or possibly owner walked towards my friend and I to tell us  ""This place is getting crowded, either get something or get out!"" I thought this was incredibly rude, but I do understand a business is a business. I would  appreciate it if he asked us if we wanted anything to drink. One good thing was that when I bought my drink, he apologized and that is something I appreciated.",0
Coffee Shop 20,"3 check-ins Amazing atmosphere, laid back and relaxing. Perfect for a little meetup, all alone study sesh, or just a simple sit in. Tried their iced americano and latte. Both are so refreshing and I ended up craving for even more. Don't even know a lot about coffee, but I know for sure I love their kind. Love this place!",1
Coffee Shop 20,"If you want to head here because you enjoy the original Epoch, don't bother. They get their pastries from a completely different vendor (I had a croissant that tasted like an undercooked pillsbury product) and I think the coffee is much worse. Plus, the vibe reads super snooty to me. I won't be returning.",0
Coffee Shop 60,2 check-ins Have been here for a couple of meet ups and attended a private Christmas party. This converted gas station has a great Austin vibe.  Ozzie and Kim were attentive to our needs and made great drinks. Owner John and his wife were onsite and super friendly. Prices were reasonable. Blueberry muffin was huge and more importantly delicious. Great selection of hot teas (not a coffee drinker).   Love knowing I'm supporting a local business.,1
Coffee Shop 60,"There are so many expletives that I want to scream after eating here. The food is total bl#$t and the quality is equivalent to a fast food drive thru but double the price. I ordered their hamburger and they advertise it as an Angus beef burger; they even went so far as to put the certified Angus stamp on their menu. Fine, its Angus beef. What I got was an under-seasoned 3 oz frozen ""Angus beef"" patty devoid of flavor or juices slapped with onions, lettuce, tomatoes with a kiddy size of fries on the side. Payed $8.25 plus tip. You can get the same exact f#$&n meal at any fast food drive thru for $4 easy. Just for reference if you go to say an Austin burger institution...you know the one I am talking about. Their burgers start at $7 for fresh in-house ground beef patties that are seasoned, thick, and juicy.  Stinson's: Please step up your food game. You have a cool location and can easily make epic food but it starts with good ingredients. What angus beef patty? Oh, you mean this frozen crap?",0
Coffee Shop 60,"I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time and decided to try their Happy Hour.  I had read good reviews about their burgers and adult beverages and was ready to give Stinson's a try.  We arrived on a Thursday about 20 minutes before the end of Happy Hour.  As we walked in, we paused in front of a coffee counter (expecting someone to acknowledge us and offer seating) but there was no one standing behind the counter. At first we were hesitant to continue on. As we passed by the coffee counter a female voice says hello in a faint voice.  Oh, the counter did have someone there, hidden by the pastry case.  We turned around and said hello back to her.  Anxious for food and beverage, we headed straight to the bar.  When we sat down there was no one behind the bar.  Besides us and the female behind the pastry case, there were two or three other customers inside.  About two minutes after we sat down, a young man came around the corner at the same time the female from the coffee counter walked over and stood behind the bar at the register.  Expecting them to greet us, we looked up and they just stared at us. Being that they apparently were not going to ask us what they could get us, we said we were here for happy hour and a bite to eat.  They kept looking at us for what felt like an eternity, not uttering a word, so we asked if we could see a menu.  One of them then handed us a wrinkled and stained paper menu with the food selections.  We asked if they had a separate Happy Hour menu and again there was silence.  They both looked at each other and then the young man said no there was not a Happy Hour menu but we have beer and wine on Happy Hour as he pointed up to the chalk board above his head.  We smiled and asked if they had any food besides the hamburger on Happy Hour. Apparently there is not a drink menu, although their website advertises craft cocktails.  Both remained silent (again) and then the female said no, we do not have a Happy Hour menu.  We said ok and mentioned that we would probably order the $5 burger then.  The two employees looked at us as if we were speaking a foreign language.  Then the female uttered what $5 hamburger?  We stated, the hamburger being advertised on the large banner outside hanging on the food truck.  The banner advertises $5 burgers and Happy Hour seven days a week.  Both employees indicated they were not aware of $5 burger for Happy Hour.  The young man then punched some buttons on the register and looked up and said well, ok we can sell a burger for $5 because that is the price that they are ringing up right now.    At this point, I was ready to leave and certainly was not prepared to order food from this place.  The employees seemed clueless and I was not confident in their ability to take and deliver a food order.  We decided since we were here and it was still HH after all, that we would each order a cocktail.  The young man had already walked off so we ordered with the female.  We ordered two cocktails and shortly afterwards asked for our check.  As we sat sipping our cocktails a few more people showed up and sat down at the tables behind us. During this time we observed the young man busing a few tables, bringing the empty plates and glasses back behind the bar area to place them in a bus-tub (in the middle of the bar area).  Next we saw him use the cash register and then make a drink order for someone.  All this without ever washing his hands.  We also made note of two wet and dirty towels on the top of the bar counter.  One of the dirty towels happen to be touching the hand operated juicer.... gross.    I would have rated this place one star.  However the drinks were decent, they had live music that started while we were there and the decor/ambiance of the facility was nice...thus the extra star. Happy Hour sign - workers inside don't know it's there See all photos from Nickie B. for Stinson's",0
Coffee Shop 60,"Stinson's is awesome!  Cozy and lovely atmosphere, great staff. We held our private Christmas Party at Stinson's yesterday. Ozzie and Kim were extremely attentive and treated us like royalty.  Awesome restaurant. Loved the glass garage doors that roll up to let the outside in! Highly recommend!  Don't forget to try the drinks, really yummy!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"No complaints about Stinson's! The shop is clean and organized, and they serve breakfast in addition to their coffee. The price is fair and the coffee is good, so what more can you really ask for.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Updated review The owner of Stinson's reached out to me and wholeheartedly expressed concern for our previous experience, we appreciated his efforts to make it right so yesterday we stopped in to give it a second shot. Our second visit was a total 180 flip, the service was great and attentive and the food came out quickly. I really do enjoy the atmosphere and what they've done with the location.  Their lattes are delicious, hot but never bitter. I tried the cool cucumber sandwich this time around, it was crisp and light and yummy. During this visit there were crunchy and savory home-made tortilla chips that came with our sandwiches, we never received chips with our meals the first time so I'm not sure if this was something new or not but I dug them.  We'll definitely be back to Stinson's, my only slight hesitation is that the food, in my opinion, is priced a little high for what it is. So perhaps not a frequent stop, but we'll be back nonetheless.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"How have i not been here before?! Cool concept and they have everything! Coffee, food, atmosphere and wifi! Great stop and this is the flagship location. Came for lunch and they have a food truck outside with great items. Coffee is delish and they have italian sodas too. Did you know they have a bar with happy hour specials?  Ozzy was great in helping me pick my drinks and we ordered pizzas and chips and salsa. They have muffins (pumpkin was awesome) We just needed a neeting spot and some snacks. This was perfect and we loved the vibe. We will definitely be back to try more food off the menu as well as check out the happy hour scene.  Big bench tables and low music for a great atmosphere. Total cool austin hangout so stop in and visit them.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I attended a private party at Stinson's.  The staff and service were friendly and attentive.  Good mixed drinks!  Very cool converted mechanic's garage / gas station with that unique Austin vibe.  They have a nice patio area, and main seating area inside can be opened to the outside using the big roll up doors left in place from the mechanic's garage, so you can sit inside and still enjoy the nice weather.  I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast and coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"My hubby and I loved our coffee we got here. The peeps are friendly, the coffee is great, and it's a cool atmosphere. Granted we only drove here to for only pit stops, we never had a coffee that was just bleh....happy customers all the time",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Incredibly underwhelming. The place wasn't busy, my husband and I ordered 2 items, and they forgot to make his sandwich. When we got it, the sandwich was disappointing. My potato cake was not what I expected. It was a loaf of potato served with a ramekin of mayonnaise. We were so hungry, and so let down. They gave us $10 credit to eat there again, which we really didn't want to. The following week my husband got a sandwich to go with the credit, and it was also just ""meh"". Perhaps it's a great spot for studying, I didn't try the coffee but have heard it's alright. Just beware of the food.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"Great hang-out spot at the corner of Burnett and 45th street.  Coffee, meals, full bar, dessert, wifi and great AC all in a converted service garage.  Lunch at 11 on a Sunday was uncrowded and the service was fast.  Order at counter, find a seat and wait not too long for food to be delivered to the table.  I expect that Stinson's can get quite loud when fully occupied, since the space is surrounded with many hard surfaces, and can pack quite a few people within its relatively small space    The arugula and cranberry salad was very fresh and a good portion.  I added grilled chicken and the chicken was moist and well-flavored.  Grilled Angus Burger was very good as well.  The only complaint was that the bun was a little dry, but overall this was a very tasty and satisfying burger.  The side of fries was piping hot when the burger was brought to the table.  We ordered a soy chai latte and regular latte to go.  The chai mix was a very nice blend with a noticeable hint of ginger.  The latte was average.  But the main places that come to mind that have better lattes specialize and focus on coffee.  So average for the breadth of what Stinson's is was quite fine.  Stinson's is a great place to visit any time of day for good beverages (for there or to go), good food and socializing.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I'm a big fan of Stinson's. I'm here pretty much every other weekday morning cranking out good work over their gloriously fast (5Ghz available) wifi and a steaming cup of almond milk latte.  Stinson's doesn't try to be ""Austin hip"", and it doesn't need to be. If I wanted cramped spaces, wobbly tables, and fighting for plugs, I'd just head to any number of other Austin coffee shops. Instead, what you get here is a really clean, surprisingly large space that serves both coffee and real food (not the traditional panini press sandwiches coffee shops normally put out).  I will say that while the prices for drinks are fairly reasonable, food prices are a tad bit high. I honestly don't mind though. Coffee shops don't make enough margins as is. If that's what it takes to keep the lights on, 5Ghz wifi pumping, and caffeine flowing, I am entirely happy to support that.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Updated review 2 check-ins Lots of natural light, decent food, alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, and 3 tables with outlets. They have everything I need to get things done on my laptop.    It's always a little awkward to interact with staff. It could be the food and coffee counter immediately inside the front door. They do make an effort, which I appreciate. They don't bring you cutlery, napkins, or condiments with your food. These things can be found at the right end of the bar. No place to grab an extra napkin. Awkward.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Stinson's has a relaxed atmosphere. I saw a few people studying and using laptops. My friend and I were able to talk easily without feeling like we were bothering anyone. Mostly everyone had their headphones in but the music was chill- think Radiohead. I had the iced coffee which was good and the egg & bacon sandwich which was only okay. The parking lot is small, but I got here at Sunday at 11:15 and there were still plenty of spaces. I would say it's best to come alone or with a close friend.",1
Coffee Shop 60,Updated review Had to return with my son. We both got their 100% angus beef burger and fries. The burgers were excellent. Hands down our favorite. The meat and toppings were so fresh. You can tell the meat was not the 80% regular hamburger meat. The fries were hot and excellently seasoned. Naked 100% angus beef burger and seasoned fries Angus beef burger with all the trimmings and fries,1
Coffee Shop 60,I have passed by a few times and it finally dawned on me this coffee shop has food!  It was a perfect quick lunch.  Clean and bigger inside than it looks.  Friendly and courteous staff.  My order was up pretty quick.  Chips with the spicy salsa were good- tastes homemade which is nice :)  Chicken salad on arugula had a nice flavor but I would have liked it to be a bit colder and have a few added veggies or something .  Wish they had more gluten free items :)  End of the day a cute yummy lunch spot that appears to have a full bar! Yummy chips and salsa- Chicken salad in arugula!,1
Coffee Shop 60,"2 check-ins Tried to call ahead to place a to-go order, but they didn't answer the phone. Just after I hung up, my phone rang, and it was Stinson's calling me back. Thought that was pretty funny and awesome. Just an example of how friendly and accommodating the employees are. As far as the food goes, I've had a great lunch (salad), breakfast taco and buttered coffee there -- all tasty! One of the walls is a garage door, which they open when it's nice out. In addition to the service and food, the fresh air makes it a really enjoyable place to stop and grab a bite/drink or sit down and work.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Updated review 4 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" Wow, it's been a year since I wrote about this place? They definitely deserve an update: Their original trailer thing was okay, but this brick & mortar on 45th & Burnet is great. The interior is great, the staff is great, the WiFi is great, and their plain & simple hot & black coffee is great. The parking here is not great.    Don't know much about their food, their beer/wine/booze, or their history and biology for that matter. What I do know is I love hanging in coffeehouses, because I can play on my phone and drink coffee for long long time. And when there's parking available around here, Stinson's is a great place to do it. Lots of coffee choices up and down Burnet these days, have some fun with them. Now this interior beats their former outside trailer any day...",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Great location, great service, really bad food. Sat outside and one employee kept going to the side of building to smoke. Not 15 feet away from entrance, right next to it.  Made the whole meal worst. No one is on the same page there.  Redo your menu, don't have employees smoking right by the front door. Get a restaurant consultant. You have a great location",0
Coffee Shop 60,"Updated review Wanted to update my review on Stinson's since I spent an entire day here last weekend (ate all my meals and numerous cups of coffee while furiously working on a deadline).  Holy shit - you must all try their veggie burger. I asked for a recommendation and am really happy that I tried this one. The veggies were great - it was heavy, satisfying, and fresh all at the same time. The flavor wasn't overwhelmingly strong, but there was enough spice to keep it interesting. The turkey sandwich was amazing as well.  Other great features? Lots of large tables! Places to plug in your computer, a bar, or the ability to move many tables together to bring in a big group for dinner. Huge fan.  Will be back again, please don't hate me guys (I promise to buy plenty of food and not be a complete waste of space!).",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Loved it here! Rustic, friendly, and inviting. Chloe my bartender went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. Would hands down come here again.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Stinson's is an odd case that shouldn't work yet surprisingly does.  Stinson gets at some of the dual nature of the Rosedale neighborhood.  Rosedale is simultaneously keep Austin weird - AND Longhorn former fraternity boy/sorority girl.  It votes left-wing save-the-planet-save-the-granola, yet packs them in at places like Pinthouse Pizza which cater to straight arrow types in their 20's and 30's.  Stinson's is a fusion of both elements.  It is a coffee house by day and a bar by night.  That is a little bit like being a nun by day,and a showgirl by night.  It is hard to get the buzz and the ambience right.  The coffee house/bar fusion sounds good as a business model since ""in theory"" you sell product morning noon and night.  However, the incompatibility of the two types of establishment may make you sell zero morning noon or night.  You want a coffee house to be nerdy - and productivity oriented.  Starbucks hits that pitch perfectly -  but a place like Epoch totally excels at nerdy/productivity.  At any hour of the day and night you are surrounded by programmers or artists or academics or moral crusaders - all working on their computers - drinking coffee and saving the world from bad virtual architecture, inappropriate ideas about Van Gogh or whatever.  They are saving the world at 2 in the morning - so you can too. Boot up your computer and get down to it!  Stinson's is a coffee house that goes for none of that.  ESPN is on giant screens everywhere.  The dominant visual is the bar - with a medium sized but excellent collection of fine bottles.  Never mind your dissertation! Have a drink and watch Memphis Beat Brigham Young!  This is not where people are going to want to get work done.  Further uncoolnesses are fraternity house neglect of housekeeping in the otherwise marvelously decorated bathrooms - and large self promotional placards pushing the marvels of Stinson's Texas-Hooey style.  So why doesn't this place go on the reject list?  a) The coffee is excellent. Much of the coffee served in North Austin destination coffee houses is mediocre at best.  b) Table sizes are good - and if you sit against the South Wall, plug access is good.  c) The food is decent enough. I can't judge the cooked dishes having not had them - but the hummus (a standard item at coffee shops everywhere that is always middle of the road, never good never bad) was served in small looking but generous in reality portions that left me waddling out of the shop at the end. Samuel C likes to be well fed.  d) The bar is intriguing. Interesting mixed drinks and interesting bottles. If one is doing one's drinking in Rosedale -  and one wants to drink fine hard liquor sitting in a chair rather than drinking a beer while standing in a parking lot -  (you know the over-rated establishment I am referring to) -  then Stinson's is a serious place to go.  I do not always want sports events around me when I am drinking. (Most of my close friends are aesthetes rather than jocks.)  But that line of bottles appeals to me and the room is fine.  So this place has a niche.  If you prefer Starbucks to Epoch but you want something better than Starbucks, Stinson's might do it for you.  And if you just finished your magnum opus and you want to cut back with a double manhattan and watch the game - well that can be arranged too.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"The owner contacted me about another visit the day after this review.  I have not had a chance to go back yet, but I appreciate the email and his comments/concern.  Will review again after I visit.  Will try this place again for breakfast and coffee, but never for dinner or music. Hum....calendar, which I just checked again before this review says music tonight; 8/28.  No music at 8.  We arrived not long after 7pm.  One other customer arrived at the same time.  No one else was there or came.  The one staff member was wonderful.  Sweet man.  Do not have his name right now, but will get it from the friend who paid with her credit card.  Food--tasted fine, but will never have a sandwich there at full price (special pricing this night).  The full price $13 sandwich was skimpy with not much inside the bread.  It was not worth the half price special. The cocktail menu is also not as advertised on the website.  Only had three on the board and the nice man stated that was the cocktail menu.  $7 well margarita was not large so not worth the price. Have driven by this place many times and never gone inside until tonight.  May return and may just keep on driving, sad to say.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"The famed tortilla espanola was cold and hard in spots so much so that i had to wonder when it was made. The $5 fries that were ""browned with tasty seasoning"" had no seasoning and took 25 minutes to come out. Service was good despite the food.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"Coffee shops are delightfully in abundance in Austin, but some of them can get incredibly crowded, loud, or just don't have outlets for your laptop. Stinsons was great in that it wasn't over crowded at all while I was there and had a pleasant ambience. Combine that with plenty of electrical outlets and good sized tables to work on, and I was impressed!  I got a chai latte, which was disappointingly syrup-y and had a strange taste. The pumpkin muffin is fantastic! And the coffee was really good too, some of the better coffee I've had in the area actually.  The barista who took my orders wasn't smile-friendly, and she seemed a bit brusque. I gave her a smile and a pleasant hello, and I seemed to sense the tiniest bit of thaw in her demeanor. That and the terrible chai were what knocked a star off, but otherwise, this is a great spot I plan to frequent again to do work!",1
Coffee Shop 60,We just found a little jewel! I've always stopped for coffee but never realized how cute the dining area was! I needed something central for a bridal shower and this place was perfect! The Manager was so easy to work with and the staff was stellar! I'm a picky Bloody Mary girl and I gotta say it was so good!! We also enjoyed sangria & mimosas and our guest all had smiles! Thank you Stinsons!!!! Perfect for a girls get together!! Great drinks & yummy food!!,1
Coffee Shop 60,"I go here to work every couple of weeks when I want a treat. They have good wifi, a gorgeous grilled cheese sandwich,  and a delicious coffee cocktail.  I CRAVE their coffee cocktails. If they had comfy seating,  I'd probably be in there every day.",1

Coffee Shop 60,"Listed in 100 reviews in 2014? Done and Done and Done., I'm pretty much a coffee shop expert. This morning, I waited 9 minutes in line for coffee, the guy in front of me waited 7.  I make that point because there was NO ONE IN FRONT OF HIM.  What there was was a barista who also had to tend the register who was preparing a  drink for someone who came in around minute 6 and didn't have to wait in line.  It's 9:15 AM.... I came here because I wanted an alternative to the ridiculous parking at Pacha and even drove through their lot just in case... I was praying for a great experience... that. ruined. it.  Come on... basic customer service in the morning says you handle the people in line in the order they come in... no special treatment.  The dude in front of me was mad... and you could tell... but he kept his composure by doing what looked like a peepee dance...  I on the other hand turned my powers to Yelp.  Stinson's has a cool venue... the old converted gas station or vehicle fixer-upper place.... it's really nice and comfortable inside... but maaaaan... you take a hot dump on a great venue when your customer service is inconsiderate to customers.  Sure, we were apologized to... but for what?  Sorry you had to wait while I made a drink for someone else?  Why did it take so long?    This is just going to set the precedent of me being snarky and mean the rest of the day...  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS CRITICAL... ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THINGS TO DO.  And yes, I wrote this review in less time than it took the guy in front of me to get his coffee while waiting at the counter WITH NO ONE IN FRONT OF HIM.  UPDATE:  So I've since been informed that there is a texting system where people can text in their orders ahead of time to have them made by the time they show up... so it wasn't the barista's fault at all.. it's the TERRIBLE CONCEPT'S FAULT.  You could literally have a scenario like this over and over again every morning.  Take a lesson from Torchy's... there are 2 registers:  one for the current line and the other for the call/order online ahead of time customers... there's also staff to cover all the orders.  My review stays at 2 stars, because this is a horrible and poorly thought out concept.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"Good food, and a pretty good atmosphere, but the wi-fi is spotty. I tried to get someone to help me with a consistent signal, but nobody seemed to know how to get it to work. Stinson's is close to my house and would be a perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and do busy work -- if only I could get connected.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"I love when a trailer is successful enough they can convert to a bricks-and-mortar hangout and not lose any of their charm. One of the benefits of these guys being in the area (Rosedale)for a while, is they know their market! Excellent espresso machines pull fabulous shots.  Comfortable indoor seating with a real (liquor) bar & 2 TV screens for watching the game.  It seems like they have captured a good mix of ""something for everyone"", without feeling like a big box chain.  Outside tables under a covered patio provide space for a gathering or place to chat and enjoy freshness outdoors.  (Also another flat screen TV here.)    Located just across from Upper Crust bakery they also serve lunch and bistro food, as well as pastries Russell's bakery. Espreso trailer turned bricks & mortar. Three screens to catch your favorite game! Outdoor covered seating & big screen See all photos from JoAnne N. for Stinson's",1
Coffee Shop 60,Easy to access. Had not tried their food before.  The burger was tasty and Gabby and Boe were really friendly and helpful.,1
Coffee Shop 60,"Really like this place.  Staff is friendly, food and coffee are very good.  I have one request...window coverings for the windows (not the garage doors).",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Updated review Since my last review the owner, John, reached out to me. I cannot say enough good things about the level of customer service he provided! It was enough to make me give them another chance. They were, again, out of the first thing I ordered, which was a veggie burger. Reading Rebekah P.'s review I wish they hadn't been because it sounds like it would've been amazing! My chicken sandwich wasn't bad though and the fries were so good!  The owner and manager, Ozzy, have gone to great lengths to change my mind about Stinson's and they truly have succeeded. They recognize the business' flaws and are working hard to change them. I believe that they will get it right and Stinson's will be that much better for it. The way a business handles challenges can make or break an experience, and for me, they have truly made me believe in the future of this place.  I'm not counting Stinson's out yet!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"After passing on the $14 veggie burger (really?) at what seems to want to be a sports bar (based on the three TV's), we opted for some chips and salsa (as starter). Came way over cooked (can you say burned?!) Disappointing. Other food was good. Over cooked chips...",0
Coffee Shop 60,I recently discovered Stinsons at an alumni meeting they host monthly. What a treat. The coffee and breakfast tacos are delicious. I like the lattes in the extra large cups. It is in a converted gas station garage so the space feels very open and light with tall ceilings. They are serving beer and wine here il now so I'll have to come back and try that I the evening. Latte,1
Coffee Shop 60,I was very disappointed after all the good things I'd heard. My husband and I both got the breakfast sandwich of which I've had much better. My tea had no sugar & I had to ask for it not be offered any! My husband chose the mocha. He said the ones at Kirby Lane were better.  We won't be returning anytime soon. I'll give you 1 star,0
Coffee Shop 60,"This area needed another coffer shop and I'm glad it was Stinson's that moved in. Despite the gas station exterior, the inside is gorgeously decorated. Garage doors let in ample light, great for getting work done.  Coffee bar is first when you walk in, food and booze bar is to the left. I like that it is separated so that you can easily get a cup to go without having to wade through a bunch of tables to get to the counter.  Chicken salad sandwich was good although I didn't like that it was served with pita chips. My friend got a pizza which looked and smelled delicious. I will definitely get that next time.  Overall, better food offerings than most coffee shops and a really cool vibe with friendly people. Parking is bad, though we found 1 hour parking on the street.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Updated review Okay, Stinson's.  I'm finally knocking you one star... but only because I care about you. I feel like there is so much untapped potential at this nicely renovated, perfectly located coffee shop/cafe/bar.  There are two problems, though, that are preventing you from achieving true five star greatness:  1) I usually stop in within 30 min of opening on Sat or Sun mornings for drip coffee, and lately the temperature of my beverage has been just warm.  Definitely not hot. By the time I walk the short distance back to my house, I have to heat it up in the microwave.  Are you serving yesterday's leftover coffee that hasn't had enough time to heat up fully, or what?   2) I can expect to wait about 10-15 minutes for my coffee if there are 2 people in line in front of me.  Nobody seems to really hustle around this place, and everything moves at a pretty relaxed speed.  Otherwise, I think everyone who works here is very friendly, and I'm still loving the baked goods from Russell's, and my dog is a huge fan of the complimentary dog treats.  Also, since you've started to make the breakfast tacos out of the trailer on order, they've greatly improved and are pretty delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Nice atmosphere, good coffee. Only question I have: almost totally out of pastries by 9:00 am?  Otherwise, nice place, friendly service.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Love that they open at 6:30 because usually the only other place around that time that I go to is Houndstooth, and I want them to think that I actually go other places.  For the longest time, I couldn't get over the fact that this place used to be a ghetto-looking gas station revived with some fresh paint. After visiting for a morning meet-up at 6:30 (that's a different story), I have to say that I love it. They nail the industrial operating-behind-a-garage-door thing well but the interior is still classy feeling. Plenty of seating. Pastry case (unfilled at that visit).  Even though it seems like you can see right through it when you drive by, the interior is cozy. Good choice of warm lighting, clean bottles and supplies displayed for aesthetics, and has a full bar and happy hour. The coffee is great and decently priced. I realized I was given a small instead of a medium, but it was early so it's alright and the girl is sweet.  Parking is difficult at that corner but a great neighborhood walk. I'll have to return to try the food and drinks at night, but think it's a great morning place so far.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"4 check-ins Stinson's is a great little coffee shop, but it also is more than that!  It is also a bar, which makes it the perfect after work date location. You can get a small coffee to get you through the night and your date can get a local beer. How more adorable can you get?  The coffee they serve is very good! The best barista is by far Lauren, who knows what you want before you even get to the counter! She is so friendly too! THeir honey bee latte is a fun twist on the classic drink and they are constantly coming up with new yummy recipes.  The lunch menu is great and quick too! Pizza, sandwiches, and even a black bean salad for the health conscious. I had the black bean salad and their breakfast pastries before and they are all very good.  Definitely recommend for a quick drive-by pickup but also for a quaint sit down! In the summer, they are going to open their huge garage door and it is going to be so nice out there. You'll definitely catch me out their on a weekend...",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I really REALLY enjoyed hanging out at Stinson's. The low-key bluesy live music they had the night we went was awesome, and the drinks were delicious. I liked the grapefruity vodka drink I got, and my boyfriend is still talking about the coffee liquor mixed drink. Next time we plan on eating there too!",1
Coffee Shop 60,Im glad this relaxed neighborhood cafe is in my hood.Especially nice for sitting on the patio or when they have the walls up and enjoying light bites and drinks.Casual vibe and good place to watch sports or work on laptop,1

Coffee Shop 60,"Good cocktails in Rosedale?  Yes please.    Good staff, good food and coffee too.   But cocktails in Rosedale!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Three stars is actually really generous!!!! I'll base that on the cocktails alone. They were really good. I had the ____ Sue...I can't remember the first word, but it had ginger beer and sweet tea vodka. My friend had some other gin and lime concoction that he had customized. Both were really good and turned out to be much cheaper than the menu said. I think that's because the service we got was really sub-par.  It started with ordering an app...some sort of potato quiche item. We were both starving; it was about 8:00 and I never got lunch. There were 2 ladies working, one much more competent than the other. We had a whole conversation regarding how big the appetizer was and if we should get one each. The incompetent one suggested that we get one each as they are small. We obliged, only to receive one and ONE set of silverware delivered by SAME said girl. I'm not sure how she misunderstood. Whatever, we just asked for a second set of silverware....and then a second round of drinks. Roughly 30 minutes went by to get those. Also, we ordered a salad for him and the deluxe chicken salad sandwich for me. Both came out separately and about 15 minutes in between. The incompetent one made the salad as I watched. She is ridiculously slow! A cat could make a damn salad faster than this girl! She had no clue what went in it. It took took her forever just to find ingredients and put in the bowl! Seriously, it was painful to watch. Then my sandwich had to be made too. Man! I just wanted to pop in grab some grub and get a quick drink. Nothing is quick or easy about this place. The food was also a major disappointment too. Chicken salad is bland and boring. The menu is SLIM!  So, the other girl, when bringing out our 30 minute drinks said she was busy making drinks for a catering job or something and that's why they took so long. First off, I'm here just a waiting! Secondly, maybe communicate that and I wouldn't have been as annoyed. She was nice and funny so that helped, but still. I think she got it and that's why the drinks were lower priced...again, mentioning the poor service resulting in a price reduction probably would have avoided this review. My experience for a quick dinner lasted 2 hours, so for a coffee/ convenience place...avoid like the plague!!!  One last thing on my overly long review....check out all the 5 star reviews of faceless folks with very few reviews and few, if any friends. Hmmmm. Yeah, I'm gonna go with 2 now that I think about it.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"Definitely one of my favorite coffee shops in town. The staff is always friendly and their coffee is supreme. Their espresso tastes great, not watered down or acidic. Also their breakfast tacos are a great size. At night, they have some fun live music on the patio. All around highly recommended!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Great coffee with almond milk, awesome veggie burgers, and relaxed atmosphere (with wifi and sports) make this place one of my favorite Austin joints.  Highly recommended for a quick pick up, or to drink a tasty latte while catching up on emails.  Can get crowded with students during finals week.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I've been going here just about everyday for over a year; since they first started in the trailer in fact.  I can't recommend Stinson's highly enough.  Whether it's a cup of coffee and a muffin in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, or a late night drink, I've never been let down by the quality of service or food here.  Every single member of their staff has always been super nice, friendly and been extremely prompt when making my drink or food.   They're a growing and expanding business and I could not be more happy for them.  Great coffee and food!   Thanks, Stinson's!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Stinson's is a beautiful, comfortable space!  Great for coffee or a cocktail. Cecy, our waitress, was super helpful and offered suggestions off the food menu.  My husband went the healthy route choosing the kale ceasar salad with chicken, while I indulged by choosing the truffle fries.  They hit the spot for both of us and we thoroughly enjoyed the suggestions!  Thanks, Cecy!!  The building was once a mechanic's garage and boy have they transformed it.  Lovely design, that is a casual, comfortable, well-lit, space.  As a native Austinite, it feels a little bit old Austin and a little bit hip Austin.  Whatever your mood Stinson's is a great addition to the Burnet Road area and great for a quick pick me up or lingering over any other choice.",1

Coffee Shop 60,"Love the ambiance & one of my favorite neighborhood gems, but I have to say that I wouldn't come here if you plan on working / being all that productive. I'm currently sitting outside at Stinson's at 2:00pm on a Wednesday, and the music is so horribly loud and unpleasant that I cannot hear myself think. Others out here have voiced that as well and left. Very frustrating...",0
Coffee Shop 60,"This place is as lovely as they get!! The coffee is good, the atmosphere is airy and light and conducive to nice chats or chilling on the laptop. But the COCKTAILS are simply delightful. Try the ""Little Bear"" and you'll be glad you did! From the baristas to the bartenders, everyone at Stinsons is happy and helpful. Something that is often hard to say about other Austin establishments. This is most definitely my new favorite local spot. Lovely light and chill people. The ""Little Bear"" and ""The Longhorn."" Yum!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"2 check-ins ROTD I work from home so I'm always looking for a coffee shop to work out of when I start getting cabin fever. I think my search is over. This little hidden gem may be my go to when I need an office. They have a coffee! They have food! They have booze! They have my heart!  I was looking for a place to have lunch and do some work. Yelpers steered me here. I'm so glad they did. The staff was super friendly. If you want coffee, you order from the coffee bar. If you want food, head over to the booze bar. I order half a personal size pepperoni pizza and a coke. That's a pretty good lunch for $6. The pizza came out hot and cheesy. It was delicious. Their wifi is fast and the atmosphere is perfect for productivity.  Bonus: you can use the PayPal app to pay your bill! If it's your first time, PayPal gives you $8 off! Be sure to tell your server you want to leave a tip. I learned the hard way. But I'll be back again soon to make up for it!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"2 check-ins ROTD Listed in Hipster Coffee Shops Stinson's is officially added to my rotation of Austin coffee shops.    Their mochas are delicious AND you can order them in this huge 20oz size, which is a huge plus for a mocha-chugger like me.  If you're lucky, you'll get Lauren to make your coffee concoction- seriously the girl can't make a bad drink, she's probably magic or something.  She  also has a really awesome name (I'm super lame I know).  The inside of Stinson's is really adorable and  full of natural light- the place is cheerful as fuck.  Currently, there's an old classic movie starring Humphrey Bogart being projected on the wall with subtitles and Frank Sinatra filling the sound waves.  Great place to get some work done- the wifi is pretty fast!  I could also see this place being great for events or brunch with the girls :)  10,000,000,000,000 bonus points for having no dirty hipsters here!  PLEASE DON'T TELL YOUR HIPSTER FRIENDS, YELPERS!",1

Coffee Shop 60,"15 check-ins I love Stinson's! I first went there when they were a trailer on the corner of 45th and Burnet. The barista and I were from the same region up in North Texas (and he'd even been a barista at my old coffee place in Amarillo), so that was pretty cool right off  the bat!   They just opened their bistro up in the newly remolded, once gas station, on the same property their trailer stood on. I could go on and on about how they renovated the gas station into the bistro, but it looks AND SMELLS amazing. It just smells like fresh wood everywhere, mixed with coffee-- its pretty much perfect. The textiles they chose, wood floors paired with brick work, even down to the sinks in the bathrooms,  it all looks so classy and amazing.     I've only had three drinks so far, chai latte (great), soy latte (great, strong), and I tried bourbon in coffee which was pretty interesting.. they said it was just one shot but I was feeling it.. ha ha! Their pumpkin muffins are great, the best muffins out of what they carry in my opinion-- and ask for it to be heated, makes it 100x better. There's a cute bar with a few beers on tap (I know Guinness is one of them), and lots of pretty liqour bottles on their dark wooden bar shelving :) I know they are still in the process of getting everything together, but I think they just expanded their menu a TON, will probably be carrying lots more food items.  On top of it all, great location.. don't hesitate to give them a try, stick around and enjoy your drink, and soak up all that yummy ""fresh wood"" scent :D",1
Coffee Shop 60,"This is probably my favorite coffee place in Austin. The drinks are always top notch and I feel like every drink they make is truly done with care. You can tell with the taste that it's quality. The guy that owns it I believe, who previously just had the trailer is a really nice guy and now with the brick and mortar location, which is beautiful, the baristas he hired have all been really great as well. My favorite drink is an iced latte, but I've also had their chai, teas, smoothies, the croissants, and it's all very good! I also appreciate the all day hours now too. Great place to stop in quick or hang out for awhile.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Everything is fantastic about this place... The incredible cocktails, coffee, food, people and atmosphere... I'm completely in love with this place stinson's is my favorite place for amazing handcrafted cocktails",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I enjoy studying at coffee shops, but often find myself driving all over Austin in search of a free table.  I was very fortunate to have Stinson's open up down the street from my home.  I love the coffee, and my father (who has much higher standards) is in full agreement.  The food is great and full of variety.  The service is stellar and the employees are friendly.  I would 100% recommend this place.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I'm a huge fan of Stinson's coffee. I have to say I've never tried any of the food, but I look forward to doing so when the brick and mortar location opens (only a few days!). I love the fact that I can stand outside and wait for my coffee on a nice day or bring my dog with me. The guys that work the trailer are great and always friendly. The coffee menu has a good amount of options from regular drip to a latte, americano, mocha and even a white mocha for those of us that want something a little sweeter.  The only bad thing about this place is the parking, which is basically non-existent. So if you want to stop for a quick brew in the AM it might be a little difficult to navigate. But I'm pretty used to that now in Austin so it's definitely not enough to deter me from this place.  This is definitely my new neighborhood spot and I can't WAIT until the brick and mortar location opens!  PS - there are rumors that they'll be opening a second location as well. That's where the trailer will go once the permanent location is open.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Great place to watch a game outside or inside! Only tried dessert and wine, but they have a great full menu! Can't wait to come back :) Outdoor hd TV",1
Coffee Shop 60,"New coffee spot popping up in Austin!  This trailer will soon have a full restaurant and bar.  Perfect location for that after work happy hour, lunch or morning drop-in for a fresh cup of your favorite brew.  If those weren't enough reason for you to try Stinson's Bistro then there's another...   You can be one of the first people in Austin to ORDER AHEAD FROM YOUR PHONE.  That's right!  Download the PayPal app on your smartphone, find Stinson's Bistro in the app and place your order (and pay) before you arrive.  They won't have the red carpet rolled out, but you can skip the lines and feel like the true VIP we all know you are.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I can honestly say this is the worst place I have ever continued to give multiple chances too and repeatedly speak on what is wrong with the quality of service as well as the product being produced here. I have spent over the last 7 months going in and out of Stinsons only to become more and more frustrated and disgusted each time. At first I went there as a customer who also works in the restaurant business and has done so for 12 + years and had compassion and understanding for those working I have spent hundreds of dollars in this place and regret every single one. The start of my disappointment happened when I Would come in and order a personal pizza and tip on top of that and not only did my co workers that also accompanied me quite frequently leave disappointed be rarely got our food in a time frame in which you can actually enjoy your lunch break. Working so close to this place has not only proven how inconsistent this place is but how those working lack character and concern for those who come in regularly and what their complaints are. Every time I walked into this place no one ever smiled or greeted you in the proper manner or even cared about giving good quality service. The next thing that disappointed me about this place was every time I ordered a pizza it was either burnt or not cooked enough and the kicker was the day I went to bite into my first slice and the entire bottom was covered in aluminum foil!!!! Yes ALUMINUM FOIL that I ate and chewed up and had to remove from my mouth! No one cared...I showed the girl working behind the counter and she just looked at me blankly....next I Start ordering the arugula salad adding cucumber and tomato .... I literally received this salad at one point with one cucumber and one tomato barely any arugula and specks of cheese....I was completely disappointed at how huge a difference you produce a salad being the only person making it one day to the next! Lastly this past Tuesday and last Friday I decided after not GOing for 2 months that I would try what they considered ""The best burger"" ....which is a lie. Both times I pulled out the hair of the lady who made my burger and all the other food I ate there. She doesn't wear a net on her head and I see why I had to pull out 2 very long strands of hair twice....once was enough but twice on two separate very close in time occasions ...sickens me! I will never go back to this place because not one person working there cared when I showed them the hair. They again blankly stare at me in disbelief that I could continue to have such terrible experiences at their place of Work and still find no one to fix it. Over 7 Months of eating bland chicken salad sandwiches that taste like freezer burnt old chicken and sandwiches that are 10 dollars and don't even fill me up I can honestly say this place is the worst I have ever experienced on all levels in my life!",0
Coffee Shop 60,"I always wondered what would go into the old filling station next to my sister's place in Rosedale, and this place didn't disappoint. Skip the lines at Starbucks and go here for great lattes, yummy cocktails and the BEST pumpkin muffin you're taste buds have ever been lucky enough to touch. I could go on and on, but don't take my word for it...just go!",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Cute little place I only just found out about through my $8 PayPal deal. The exterior looks like some abandoned gas station, but the interior is a shnazzy, elegant coffee shop.  Ended up getting a vanilla chai latte since I'm not big on caffeine + a tortilla española. I like how this place is open at 6:30am and stays open late, too.  Vanilla chai latte: a bit too sweet, esp. if you were to drink this after it's turned cold, but you can definitely taste that otherwise the spices are a good, soothing blend. EDIT: They topped off my chai with a bit more chai and milk to try to decrease the sweetness. No charge. How sweet!  Tortilla española: I've actually been to Spain and had this popular Spanish breakfast item...pretty much every day. However, that was 6 years back or so, and I don't remember how it tasted. Stinson's makes this dish plus its aioli in house. Nothing to write home about, but it was still pretty good.  Ambiance: This is a nice place. I like the French(?) music being played. The news was on (abc station) and they play movies through Netflix on another big screen. They were playing a black and white film. Unsure what it was, but it meshed well with the classic beauty feeling of this coffee shop. Both screens are situated at the sides, so they're not too distracting.  Temperature: THIS was awesome. I've gone to WAYYYY too many places to study and end up getting cold pretty quickly. This place was nice and cozy.  Service: Great, friendly server.  Other: They have a plastic punch card that also works for their other Stinson's places (Stinson's Deep Eddy). For every purchased 10 drinks or treats, you get 1 free.",1
Coffee Shop 60,I really like the vibe here for after work drinks. They're super strong and full of yummy things!,1
Coffee Shop 60,"Went for coffee early on a Sunday afternoon - there was only one other client when I walked in but the place filled up within an hour or so. Cute atmosphere, nice barista,  decent coffee, and I'm delighted that they offer almond milk - though I wish it were the unsweetened kind. Didn't try any food.  I often like to use my computer at coffee houses and I appreciated the strong wifi and good availability of outlets for plugging in. However, due to the large windows, there was a lot of glare that made it hard to see my screen - perhaps at another time of day or in the evening, it would be better.  I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood and offers another option to Pacha (too small) and Upper Crust (no wifi).",1
Coffee Shop 60,"The first time I went was for breakfast.   It was a pleasant experience so I thought about patronizing the business one evening.  The ambiance was ideal - low key and soothing.  The second time however,  the music was overwhelming, making conversation impossible.  I find the trend of loud venues an unsettling pattern that is major turn off.   I truly hope that Stinson's doesn't become a victim of the Californication wave consuming Austin.  The staff however is professional and very kind.",1

It was very delicious coffee!  And while I wait for the sweating and jitteriness to wear off, I think to myself, ""Yes Ma'am, a fine cup of joe, indeed!""  BTW, you can text in your order ahead of time.  For those of you that think ordering in person takes up WAAAAAY too much time and terribly inefficient.",1
Coffee Shop 60,"Great coffee by day, and tap-beers or cocktails by evening:  what's not to love?  The quality of the coffee drinks I've had here have been excellent.  I really enjoy the roast which isn't so dark that it borders on burnt like some large coffee chains.  Enjoy the atmosphere and good WiFi.  There are some coffee houses where it's next to impossible to get a seat or decent WiFi throughput.  Thankfully Stinson's hasn't become one of those venues (yet?).  I don't go there for the food.  They really don't have a kitchen there, and there's plenty of nearby restaurants and cafes with better food.  I read some people have taken them to task for the service. I've never had to wait too long, but I've also frequently taken advantage of texting my coffee order which I *love* to do.  It's great to swing by there in the a.m. before work and have my coffee ready to go.  Now, I just wish they'd provide those little stirring-plug sticks like a certain international coffee chain does that greatly reduces spillage from the little hole in the lid....",1

Coffee Shop 60,"11 check-ins Listed in Coffee Coffee Coffee ""Can't beat a great coffee trailer that has superb coffee! Soon to be a full blown coffee shop.""  I'm always looking for a good place to get coffee. Lo and behold this little wonder pops up out of no where. What used to be Cutler Automotive is now becoming Stinson's coffee shop! At first I thought it was a little odd considering the long-time business, Upper Crust, is across the street.  I've been going there for years, and they have phenomenal baked goods and coffee. However, that does not mean I don't have room in my repertoire of coffee shops. There's always room for more!     The great thing is you can text them your order at (512)-968-4970 so your drink is ready when you arrive. This makes that quick coffee fix even quicker. Although an IV filled with coffee would probably be the fastest solution for that morning drag. I love this place because it's around the corner from my office, so it's easy to stop by on my way to work. Don't forget about the orgasmic pumpkin spice muffin. See if they'll heat it because it's addicting. I'm definitely going to be craving these come fall. Now this place isn't perfect right now, they're in a trailer in front of the shop that they're trying to remodel in order to move in. They have been trying to accommodate people however they can though. There's picnic tables with a huge flat screen tv, free Wi-Fi, and some parking spaces on the side; a little awkward to get in and out though. Once the actual café opens, Alex said that they will be serving sandwiches too. There is definitely quite a bit of coffee competition in this area, so I wish Stinson's the best in a successful venture. Whether it's a plain cup of coffee, a fancy latte with a pretty design, an iced latte for the days where you can fry an egg on the sidewalk, or a delicious chai tea latte. They have it all and, in my opinion, are definitely worth checking out. Medium mocha latte and pumpkin spice muffin",1
Coffee Shop 60,"I can only comment on the breakfast taco I ordered.  The two star rating is really based on one, and only one fundamental, unforgivable, downright sacreligious practice at Stinson's. In this day of age, an old born and raised West Austinite plays hell finding a good, simple, breakfast taco to go in the central / Tarrytown side of town...especially on Sundays. And since it is now easier to find an egg taco with Kimchi and Pastrami than one with simple breakfast sausage, I was excited to learn Stinson's was open on Sunday AND had breakfast sausage. It was close to being a good taco.  The tortilla was a quality packaged model, fresh, and plenty good for the purpose.  The potatoes were a 3/4"" dice,  fried to just tender, not crispy.  A matter of taste, but done properly for those who prefer a soft potato.  I prefer a smaller dice and fried crispy.  The eggs were scrambled properly!  ...not a burned omlette ...like Torchys (yuck).  Unfortunately the sausage was greyish white, and tasted like the pellets from a frozen pizza.  They used frickin Italian sausage!  Lordy. That is a hanging offense.",0
Coffee Shop 60,"I love this place! As a senior at UT, I've frequented dozens of coffee shops around Austin and Stinson's honestly serves the best lattes I've had in town. Their espresso is rich but never bitter, and their steamed milk is always thick and smooth. They have plenty of outlets, great natural lighting, and their service is always attentive. With lunch, dinner, and drink menus available, Stinson's has everything you'd ever need for a day of studying or a night out with friends! Highly, highly recommend.",1

While trolling on Instagram, my sister and I found this place and decided well because we are sisters, we had to go get some coffee here. Hidden around a corner off Caesar Chavez, the little daisy sign that says Coffee and the graffiti wall is the perfect invite in. You walk into a quaint little room with a small coffee bar where you meet your barista. Small menu, which is perfect. I opted for an iced coffee and sister got a latte. We walked around and look at some art, clothing, shoes & jewelry while we waited on our drinks. I must admit, this is one of the BEST iced coffees I've ever had. While normally I want creamer or sugar, this one didn't need it. SERIOUSLY AMAZING! Not to mention the cute cups their drinks are served in!

This trailer is indeed tiny and they have a cozy space for enjoying some caffeine and pastries. I ordered a green mint tea that was served piping hot. The coffee smelled wonderful and the donut the lady in front of me ordered sure looked good too.  Friendly service, both cold & hot caffeinated beverages and a local place that has some wit, that is what you will find here.",1
Coffee Shop 58,"This place was cute. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was great - creamy with plenty of espresso coming through. There was only one employee trying to make the coffee, take orders and work the register, so it took a little while, but it wasn't a big deal and she was nice about it. The coffeeshop is connected to a really cool bookstore and boutique you can browse in while drinking your coffee, and there is one or two tables to sit at, but don't come here with a large group of friends and expect to sit and chat or work for a long time. If I'm in the area and want someplace that's a little more low-keu, I'd come here again.",1
Coffee Shop 58,"2 check-ins Me and a few friends were off to Micklethwaits to gorge on some bbq and I decided to grab a coffee at this cute truck in the same, small food truck court on Rosewood ave. The woman working there was extremely friendly and the hand poured coffee was hot, strong and worth every penny of the $3.25.  I'm often disappointed by regular coffee being weak at a lot of places, but here this certainly isn't the case. I will be back (even when I'm not engaging in reprehensible gluttony at Micklethwaits)",1
Coffee Shop 58,"The girl working there is very sweet and as an out-of-towner in town for a couple of days, she gave me some good tips on food places. My chai was perfect and creamy, and made with almond milk. Loved this little coffee stand!",1
Coffee Shop 58,"VERY weak coffee. I got a pour over because they were out of Iced coffee. When I received it. I took a drink and it has a very watery after taste. I took the lid off and it looked like Ice Tea it was so weak. And at $3.50 for a 12 ounce coffee I expected at least a cup of strong black coffee. In a town with such an awesome coffee scene, I was highly disappointed. I won't return",0
Coffee Shop 58,Perfect spot for a mid day pick me up! They even had local honey to add a unique taste.,1
Coffee Shop 58,"3 check-ins After filling the void in my stomach with tasty meats next door we were walking back to the car and noticed this little unassuming coffee shack.  A buddy of mine from the Bay Area was with me and saw they carried Blue Bottle Coffee who apparently has a cult following back there told me I had to try it.  You don't have to tell me twice and with that I grabbed the cold brew.   It was descried as New Orleans Style and flavored with Chicory making it a most excellent drink.  Parking in this lot filled with what is becoming well known BBQ spot, a juice trailer and coffee shop, a hair studio and some other business that escapes my mind might be the only drawback to stopping in here easily, so park on the other side of Rosewood on the side road and play frogger to acquire your java.  My 2 pennies",1
Coffee Shop 58,The coffee from here is absolutely amazing. I have never tasted coffee this good in my life. I recommend every one to try this place if you are a coffee drinker. I will never go Starbucks again!!,1
Coffee Shop 58,This is such a cute little spot! Amanda is very friendly and has wonderful suggestions for other local spots to check out. Definitely looking forward to coming back.,1
Coffee Shop 58,"I was glad to finally make a stop at this sweet little coffee shack. This unassuming trailer makes a great cup. My baseline drink is a mocha and they made it just right, not too sweet and oh so savory with some great quality beans and a friendly barista. Definitely worth a visit. I know I will be going back.",1
Coffee Shop 58,First to Review New kids on the block with a great product. Love that Bluebottle quality! So glad to see them in town.,1
Coffee Shop 50,"Updated review i'm feeling generous today bc i just had a bite of their quiche and it was delicious (as usual). they change their quiches every day so you never know what you are going to get but they are consistently good.  their pancakes are still the bomb (today i went for banana and walnut). and i like that i can come to this small, austin-y, tasty place and never be disappointed. tired of all the trendy brunch spots that deliver on atmosphere but fail on taste.  only downside? parking can be hard bc there are limited spots.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Wow! Most tasty and wacky brunch in Austin. Locally sourced ingredients and amazing coffee. I am stunned by how much I liked this place, I expected to like it but not to LOVE it.  Pancakes were incredible, french toast came with espresso cinnamon butter (good god is this real life???) and the bacon was so flavorful.  Expect a wait when you come here, if you want a fast breakfast out go to McD's. Pacha is a place to while away an hour or two with some great breakfast food and some great coffee. Staff were so efficient and kind, they are doing a great job!  I will be back, sooner rather than later.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"*9/7/16* Pacha! Made a quick stop for pancakes at this quirky, small coffee shop. I'd recommend parking in a nearby neighborhood and walking over to this vibrant yellow cafe.  The menu had decent amount of things on it, there were many other items, but I read pancakes were great here, so that is what we ended up ordering. We got the Pancake Special - half size with blueberry and pear filing, and over-medium eggs on the side.  These pancakes were delicious! Buttery, soft and had a nice browning to it. The fruits were a plus, sweet and delightful, along with the maple syrup which was not too sweet.  I'd come back for a quick bite of pancakes again, and maybe even a cup of coffee. Pacha - view of the ordering station and coffee bar",1
Coffee Shop 50,"2 check-ins The interior was really pretty and homey but it was very busy. The wait line wasnt too long, but we had to wait almost 30-40 minutes for food. If not for the wait, this place would have been worth 5 stars. We ordered french toast,  beef cake, and pear and bacon pancakes! The pear and bacon pancakes were both sweet and salty and it tasted really good. Odd combination, but it went really well together~ The french toast was very in my friends opinion ""french"". It was sweet and fluffy and tasted very cinnamonym The beef cake was a little salty for my taste but it had a spicy aftermath i liked. I liked how there was different pieces of meat in the pancake. Omlet Beef cakes See all photos from Sarah L. for Pacha",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Typical indie coffee shop, and I mean that in the best way.   Though they have a relatively small sitting area it would be a great place to study or read.    Their highlight is their pancakes, particularly their apple/bacon/scallion pancakes.   The dough itself is very fluffy and very slightly crispy at the edges (i.e., just as it should be).  I have to say the pears, scallions, and bacon marry together really well.    Was probably a top 10 pancake for me!    I'd definitely return.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"2 check-ins The old (Elizabeth Street) Bouldin Creek Coffeehouse didn't die. It moved up north.  Same old, funky wood house painted brightly. Same lovable, crusty punks behind the counter. Same vaguely-militant health-conscious ethos.  And look at that hot sauce selection: yelp.com/biz_photos/pach… !!!!  What should you get? They have veggie tortas and quiches with PERFECT crusts.  Quiche: yelp.com/biz_photos/pach… Veggie torta (this is an Italian torta ... Not to be confused with the Mexican sandwich of the same name or the sweet ""torte""): yelp.com/biz_photos/pach… Just picture a giant, beautiful pie filled with beets and greens and onions and cheese and stuff.  Oh, and apparently they have pear/bacon pancakes: yelp.com/biz_photos/pach…  Pacha is an Austin gem. And if it's April, see if you can get some loquats from the big trees out front.  Apparently they're closed at night. Which would have made them dead to me in my 20s But I'm fine with the daytime grind now. Veggie torte",1
Coffee Shop 50,"3 check-ins I am in love with Breakfast at Pacha and so is everyone else. The space is fun and vibrant with color, and there are tables packed together inside.  There is nothing fancy here, just a converted house.  There are a couple of spots to sit outside at the front and back door.  On a cooler day, eating outside is lovely, as you can then escape the noisy banter inside.   On a Sunday there is a line to the door, and patience must be found as you wait 30-40 minutes after your order is placed.  You place your order at the cash register, and then receive a number to take with you to a table to wait. The food is then delivered to you. Tables are first come - first serve, so snag one if you are a party of two.  They now serve Breakfast at Pacha until 6pm, and after 11am you can select from the afternoon menu.  The place is packed on the weekend, and bubbly with noise of breakfast eating patrons.  Even though the place is small, the selection of drink and food options to choose from is vast.  Everything is locally sourced and organic.  They make everything themselves in house - even the delicious looking deep dish pies and quiches (you can custom order one for yourself if you ask 3 days in advance).    I love that they have a gluten free menu that includes French toast as an option (that is rare!).  The gluten free French toast is delicious, and the maple-pecan-espresso butter is out of this world.  I didn't even need syrup.  It was the perfect combination of slightly sweet meets savory.  The smoothies are creamy, thick, and very filling.    The pancakes can be made savory, or jam packed with fruit.  My husband loved the pancake batter, but didn't find the combination of bacon and pear very good.  Next time he will stick to the blue berry.  The pancake bite I had was delicious. The batter is sweet, moist, and fluffy.  I just wish they had a gluten free version.  The omelets are also fresh and tasty.  You can select how many eggs you want, and what ingredients you want inside.  It is served with a slice of bread (can substitute with a gluten free bread).    For drinks you can select from a menu of coffee, tea, beer, wine, organic cider, or MIMOSAS (my personal fave!).  The organic coffee they have here is superb.  They make a mean coffee drink.  The pacha latte mix that they have premade and mix up with their coffee is made from soy milk and not too sweet. I highly recommend it.  The mimosas are $4 and on the larger size.    The parking here is very limited. There are a few spots in the back.  But, I have always had to park in the neighborhood. Bacon and pear pancake w/ green onion Two egg omelette w/ veggies and bacon and gluten free bread Sunday brunch line See all photos from Mindy H. for Pacha",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Came here for breakfast/brunch expecting a really good experience and left feeling ripped off. The parking situation here is pretty bad. We lucked out and found a spot in the front but keep in mind that they only have about 6-7 spots in the back. When we arrived the line was decently long but not terrible for Austin. Waited in line for about 20 minutes then ordered our food. After ordering our food I saw a sign that said expected kitchen wait time was 45 minutes. I should of stopped after seeing that sign...           I understand this is a small cafe/coffee shop but this isn't Franklin BBQ, or a popular brunch restaurant. If your a small cafe that can't make an omelet under 20 minutes than you probably should just stick to pastries and coffee. After about 1 hour the food we ordered finally came out. It wasn't that great at all... It was not worth waiting over an hour for.           The only thing they did good at was making coffee. The food, wait time and the parking situation sucked but the coffee was delicious. I don't plan on coming back ever again for breakfast/brunch. $5 dollar taco.",0
Coffee Shop 50,Came here for a pre birthday brunch with some close friends. We each got something different and so I got to try a bit of everything. The pancakes are definitely some of the most delicious things that I have tried. I tried banana pear and cheese and bacon and they were so good. The French toast has  comes with a really tasty cinnamon butter and the coffee is so fresh. Might be a little small but since I have lived in Nola for a while I thought it was fairly sized. I went with a large group probably the largest there but it wasn't too noisy or too quiet and the staff was great Mimosas!!,1
Coffee Shop 50,"Pear, bacon, and green onion. Who knew this odd combo can be so tasty when mixed in a fluffy pancake?!  Friend and I came here for brunch. Neither of us were especially hungry, so we shared a full size pear, bacon, and green onion pancake with 2 eggs, over medium. If only we had known how good the pancake will turn out, we would've gotten our own  We ate it as was and skipped the syrup. A pancake that's delish without syrup? Not sure how American this is, but it was delish!  Why 4/5? The wait was ~30 min, and parking.  But all in all, I will gladly return and try the rest of their menu Pear and bacon pancake with green onions + 2 over-medium eggs",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Love the funky vibe of this little place in an old house.  Pancakes are truly incredible--would go back for those.  The hash was good but kind of wished I'd ordered the pancake!!!  Others loved the savory pancake as well.  Eggs were cooked to order, and all at our table loved their meals.  Not much parking, but there are some spaces next door, where the small Patcha parking sign is not readily  seen.   Would go back to this one again!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"This little ramshackle house on Burnet makes me happy.  Ambience is artsy and homey.    Pros:   Good Coffee Fun music Great breakfast locally sourced, humanely raised ingredients Best Peanut Butter cookies (according to the guy at the table next to me) fast wifi friendly staff  Cons: Limited parking  Here everything is counter service.  So when you arrive, walk up to the ordering counter.  Place your order, pay, take your order finder card and find a place to sit, or stick around for pick up if you are taking your order to go. Food will be brought to you.  If you want something more, go back up to the counter and place another order.  At the end of your visit, please clear your table and place your dishes in the dish pan.  On my last visit I had the pear, bacon, green onion pancake with two eggs on the side.  So delicious!  Pancakes were served with syrup, which I didn't touch.  The pancake batter base and pears were sweet and flavorful enough on their own that I found no need to add additional syrup. Pancake with apple. add two poached eggs and bacon. Pear, bacon and green onion pancakes.  Add two scrambled eggs w/ cheese.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"This place is not worth the wait. A little too hipster for our liking. We waited for over an hour for our food, no refills on regular coffee, not much seating and many indoor flies. It was crowded when we arrived but after people left we waited hoping someone would clean some of the available tables so we could sit, but we had to ask a worker for them to actually get to it. Can't comment on service because there wasn't much. May seem like a good idea to chance it but if you don't mind the long wait, have at it.  Food: my bacon & pear pancake was very good and eggs cooked perfectly. My boyfriend's meal however was runny scrambled eggs and nothing-special French toast.    We will not be coming back. Waited an hour for runny scrambled eggs and French toast. Not coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"10:52 AM Order was made 12:10 PM They just remember to plate put food.  What did we order? Quiche and salmon platter that required no cooking. They just need to slice the food and plate it. They did not even apologize.  Also, I saw the server dropped some avocado and placed it back on the plate. Very organic indeed. Yuck!  I'm reviving my Yelp account for this. Never returning to this place. The back porch has hungry crows flying around waiting to eat your food.  Not to mention all the bird crap all over the porch.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Really really small place. Very popular, local,vegan and vegetarian fare in addition to bacon, eggs, pancakes, etc.  Very little parking with threats of towing, as is SOP in Austin.  There are a couple of tables outside.  Coffee was excellent, as was the bacon.   Husband had a bacon and cheddar pancake.  It wasn't anything he would order again, but it was flavorful and yummy to me. Glad we stopped in. Awesome bacon.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Oh man the par, bacon and scallion pancake is amazing!!!! Emits sweet and savory, so good plain, with hot sauce, dipped in egg yolk or smothered in syrup.  The eggs over easy were cooked perfect and bacon side was crispy.  We ordered some grapefruit juice mimosas and drip coffees.  The people working were super friendly and helpful, always a plus when eating in a smaller, eclectic spot.  So glad we came in today! Pear, bacon and scallion pancake, with a side of eggs over easy and bacon",1
Coffee Shop 50,"4 check-ins Pacha is that little, cozy, eclectic cafe with a equally eclectic staff that has good coffee and the BEST DAMN lox and toast plates. The tomatoes, the capers, ask for some serranos, the avocado---gluten free bread you can request that is actually really good!!?? It's a small little space and occasionally there's a pop that will make finding a table an ordeal---but it's worth the wait. I love the energy of the space. Really good. I took out the cream cheese and asked for avocado instead :) gluten free udi's bread",1
Coffee Shop 50,"3 check-ins We came here on a Saturday morning for some breakfast and I was a little apprehensive due to what seemed like mixed reviews on yelp.  Based on the pictures people posted it was enough for me to give it a try.  We arrived around 10:30am and as people mentioned there isn't a lot of parking, but we were lucky enough to find a spot in the back immediately.  The line to order only had a few people in front of us which actually gave us time to look over the menu and nail down our order since this was our first time here.  We were noticing as we were about to order there weren't many tables and most people seated had not gotten their food yet which gave me a little anxiety.  We proceeded to order a banana pancake and a meaty pancake with a mocha latte with Mexican chocolate.  We stood and waited for a table and one became available within a few minutes which was nice.  We did wait about 45 minutes for the food, but we were for warned that it would take that long so we didn't mind.  The food itself was delicious and the majority of it is all local farms and organic. The coffee was also great and served in ginormous cups which makes the wait for the food more palatable so I would recommend a beverage with your meal. Here is what I would not recommend if thinking about coming here. - I don't know about coming with a large group as the biggest tables probably only seat 5-6 people. - kids unless they are prepared to sit still for quite awhile - coming with someone you don't plan to conversate with because there will be plenty of time for that. - if you are in a hurry although I will say at 11:30 when we were leaving it did appear to be emptying out so maybe later in the morning towards almost lunch time is the way to go. We will definitely be back though as we loved the food and coffee. Banana pancake Support our locals Meat pancake See all photos from Charles Y. for Pacha",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Updated reviewCame during brunch hour, wait was long, but they warned us of that, so I get it.  What I don't understand is how the table next to us, that was 3 tables behind us in line, got their food before us even though they ordered the exact same thing (bacon pear scallion pancakes with eggs and sausage). Prior to bringing their food out, an employee came by to tell us that there were no more sausages available (mind you, this was after 50 minutes of waiting) so we'd have to settle for bacon. Honestly, I would not have gotten meat at all if there was no sausage available bc the pancake already has bacon in it.  What made me extremely upset, however, was that the aforementioned table that got their food before us despite them ordering after us, clearly had sausage! What? Please do better next time. Extremely disappointed. Gave 2 stars bc the pancake is still pretty dang good.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"With so many awesome coffee shops to choose from in Austin, I wouldn't waste my time going back to Pacha.  The main reason is the horribly rude staff.  Typically I don't like to rag on the staff, especially after just one interaction... maybe they were having a bad day?  However, after having several conversations with friends about the service, it seems as though they're consistently rude. The coffee was good, but the food was just so so, and not worth dealing with the staff again.  Also, it's extremely small and there is very limited parking.  There are at least two other places to get amazing coffee, service, easy parking, and a much more relaxed atmosphere on Burnet and they will be getting my business from now on!",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Stopped by before we headed back home to Houston Monday morning.  Super friendly and helpful staff. I had a breakfast taco with bacon, cheese, and scallion. I loved it. He had a the cornbeef hash. He wasn't crazy about it... But We both agreed that we just had the BEST BLUEBERRY PANCAKES ever in our lives! Best blueberry pancakes. The dough is different.. It's crispy, buttery, and unreal :)",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Fantastic food and friendly staff. I will say it is a bit pricey for a college student, however, for a special treat, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The ingredients were fresh and I waited no more than 15 minutes for my food.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"5 stars to Pacha! Delicious fruit filled pancake. Wonderful omelet, farm to table wonders. Latte the size of a small bathtub. I ate until I was stuffed. I hardly ever eat pancakes, but I had a feeling this was another league of pancake and it was. Don't miss!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Nice atmosphere!!  The Bacon is supppper crispy and so soo good. The grass-fed hash is so delicious.. But, there pie is so good. I had the apple-pear pie and so tasty and I wanted more Mexican Mocha latte!!!!!!! #yum",1
Coffee Shop 50,"On a Tuesday morning we couldn't find parking (there are only 10 spots) so we ended up finding a space on 46th street and just walked over. We sat on the small shaded back porch that had two ceiling fans running which was nice and kept us cool despite the 90 degree heat. Next time we'll be sure to bring our dog to come hang out with us.  The staff is very friendly and easy going, which already puts them well ahead of other coffee shops in Austin. My boyfriend was able to have a video conference call, so I know the wifi works well also. This is a really hip spot with an eclectic fan base which makes for a fun environment to meet up with friends, not so much for studying or reading (unless with headphones).  I had the smoked wild salmon plate on a toasted seeded bagel with cream cheese and tomato-dill pico and it was seriously slap-yo-mama good. PHENOMENAL even. I couldn't help but make gleeful little moans as I took each bite- so much that my boyfriend rolled his eyes and asked if I needed some alone time, ha! He had the classic American breakfast with bacon and grilled potatoes and he said it was really well done and all the flavors worked together. We were so impressed!  We will absolutely be returning to Pacha! Smoked Wild Salmon on toasted seeded bagel nomnomnom The Smoked Wild Salmon Plate is so bomb!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"I visited Austin for the weekend, and ended up trying out a few brunch spots, but Pacha was the winner in my eyes. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had, and I've had a lot of good pancakes. So good, in fact, that I tried to duplicate the apple and cranberry at combo at home the next day (with some success...go me!). This might sound crazy, but I loved the lighting and cute tables and tablecloths. Prime food photo backdrops. My friend and I each got a delicious latte while we waited for our food on a busy Sunday afternoon. Two egg white omelets with veggies and a pear and cranberry pancake for me, and an apple and cranberry pancake for her.  Amazing. Seriously. I savored every bite. I want more.  The restaurant is tiny and there isn't a lot of parking. Because of the size, it can take some time to get your food, so if you're starving, grab a cup of coffee. It's good coffee. Very good coffee. Addictively good coffee.  I also bought two cookies to take home with me because I couldn't resist. Such a cute spot for a fresh, healthy and delicious brunch. I wish I could take them back to Denver with me! Pacha latte and cookies! Excellent brunch! Pancake with apples and cranberries, and egg white omelets with veggies. Everything was amazing.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Used to go here all the time. Too long a wait even when there are only 1 or 2 people in line. Rude service. When food wasn't cooked right, was told that was the way it was supposed to be (raw potatoes and turnips, really?). Not going anymore.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Wonderful brunch place worth the parking hassle! I consider myself an anti-pancake person, but I think I can make exception for Pacha.  I had the pear, bacon, and scallion pancake and thought it was outstanding. On the menu it might seem a little nondescript (the description just says something about a savory-sweet taste), but I think that is underselling it by a lot - it reminded me of a bit of Korean pajeon, but perhaps less heavy (not a bad thing). I satiated my anti-pancake tendencies by adding two eggs and Canadian bacon to the side, which did the trick.  I took a bite out of my friend's Beef Hash and thought it was tasty, but maybe not as ""special"" as the pancakes. I'm inclined to recommend the pancakes for first-timers, but that's out of a sample size of two dishes tried.  As an added bonus there are many quaint houses in the neighborhood behind Pacha that you will inevitably park in. Seriously, don't bother trying to get a spot at Pacha - there's not many and the killer incline will murder smaller cars.  Overall there don't seem to be much seating, but we didn't have to wait during peak hours on Saturday morning. This was a good experience and I look forward to coming back!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"This review is for the coffee, love the cold brew and they have non dairy options that makes life so delicious~ The food is very good as well.They use filtered water! They seem to have a deep care for the earth and what they purchase for you to consume. They are still managing the wait times most likely not because the place is to small as the menu is just to big. Less to offer less to wait for. I recommend this place. I took one star off because I'm not a fan of the microwave.",1
Coffee Shop 50,First time here : Oh my... That pear bacon pancake... 'Naf said!.....  This time : got in at 11:30. now 1:15 still waiting for food . This is crazy. Almost 2 hours . The rush went down 30 minute ago. Still. No. Food!,0
Coffee Shop 50,The building screams local Austin.   A brunch place not far from the city.  Very limited parking but extra parking is available on the street.  Walking in ...  The place is small with a handful of small tables.  The menu lists out the local farms and sign states they are 90% organic.  The menu sounds very good and the portion are big.  I ordered a half portion of blueberry pancake and salmon lox omelet.    The wait took a total of one hour but it was worth the wait.  They offer free wifi and had no problems just sitting and sipping on coffee.    Pancakes-- perfect! Omelet was delicious and fluffy.  Definitely a winner and can't wait to be back to try lunch items.,1
Coffee Shop 50,"My boyfriend and I went there for the first time today. There was a 40 minute wait which we dealt with. The guy behind the counter was a little off putting with his attitude but I looked past it. We both ordered the gluten free French toast. I was pretty excited that I found somewhere that had gluten free French toast in the city. Well, my boyfriend's French toast ended up NOT being gluten free and he got really sick afterwards and still is sick several hours later. (He is truly gluten intolerant.) Seeing that they had 40 plus minutes to get our orders right it was really upsetting and off putting for them to get it wrong. We are not going back.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Pear bacon scallion pancake and chai tea served in an oversized mug inside of a cozy, charming, slightly kitschy house? I dig it!

Overall, I really like the vibe, although parking is limited (I believe 6-8 spots). The scallion pancake is unique and delicious and if you like savory and sweet things, this is the thing to get.",1

I like that this company are conscious business owners... not sure I got the friendliest service since I'm pretty sure the lady working the cashier heard me say ""bleh"" to pear pancakes...I get it, I'd take it personally too... but maybe I just don't like the pear and pancake combo.

The chai was also great. Highly recommend for a leisurely Sunday brunch place. The people are friendly, the atmosphere is quirky but comfortable, and the food is delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"2 check-ins Hi. I got food here. It was good.  My foods:  - French toast plate with eggs: French toast wasn't overpowered with powdered sugar so I can actually taste the bread.  - beef specialty pancake: I got the half size and I regretted it on my first bite because it was so unexpectedly good! Next time I'll get a full size. At first, the combination of the pancake didn't sound appealing but that pancake slapped me in the face.  - blueberry muffin: I'm not usually a fan of sweets but I finished my meal off with this well balanced muffin. Size, moistness(?) and sweetness was great.  Pros: - the staff here are friendly and very welcoming. Yay Austin TX. - surprisingly they have a good selection of food including baked goods and gluten free items for those that do that stuff.  Cons: - parking is a turn off, I came here once and just left since I couldn't park - expensive but it's probably because they use organic ingredients. So that we don't die.  Maybe pro or con: - the place is small and intimate. There was a continuous flow of people coming in. Lots of conversations going on. It would be cool to see them expand! Blueberry muffin Beef specialty pancake - sounds weird, but deeeelicious French toast with eggs",1
Coffee Shop 50,"3 check-ins Such a cute house sitting on Burnet. On a Saturday morning right at 8am there was a small line and the wait for food wasn't as bad as I had read about. When we left it still wasn't too bad so maybe it gets more crowded towards noon. The parking in the back is definitely limited and I probably wouldn't have stayed if I couldn't find a spot. I guess it helps with crowd control?  After reading a bunch of reviews I had to try the pear bacon scallion pancake, and it was DELICIOUS! I would highly recommend. My boyfriend got the french toast with eggs and meat (bacon) which was also pretty good, not smothered in powered sugar like other places. Sadly, the pacha latte wasn't as great as I had hoped but probably because I like my coffees pretty sweet. Also, when I asked for it with soy the waiter said that it always comes with soy so that's pretty cool. I think I'll have to try it iced next time. French toast with eggs and meat Delicious pear bacon scallion pancake and small pacha latte",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Came here for brunch with some friends and it was overall pretty delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and so is the parking lot, so it took us a while for us to find parking. Pacha offers a wide variety of menu options including breakfast, brunch, and afternoon or dinner meals.  Our little group ordered their famous pear/bacon/scallion pancake, sourdough French toast, and the beefy melt. The pancake was absolutely delectable, the mix of flavors is just right and the combination is unique. The French toast was mediocre and nothing special. I thoroughly enjoyed the beefy melt as well, but noted it felt a little too heavy and greasy for me.  Pacha has unique menu items, which I advise all customers to take advantage of, as the prices are a bit high. Pear/bacon/scallion pancake, beefy melt, French toast",1
Coffee Shop 50,"An Austin ""must try"" so of course, we tried it.  Very organic, laid back and no nonsense breakfast joint. The vibe is very ""Austin"" or if you're from San Diego it's very Ocean Beach. Or if you're from Colorado, it's very Boulder.  Everything is made fresh and you can taste it. The eggs, potatoes, pancakes, and even coffee are tasty, nothing fancy, just straight up home cooking goodness.  The prices are reasonable too $8.35 for 2 eggs + potatoes + sausage or bacon. $5.25 for their famous pancakes. My hubby is still talking about his apple/pear pancakes, and I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy sausage.  We went mid-week during the summer so there wasn't a wait and plenty of seating. Although as we were leaving most of the tables were occupied by people sipping coffee on their computers, so a table shortage was in the future.  We'd both recomend this place for sure.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"A nice place and the brewed coffee was inexpensive and tasted good. Staff was friendly and I am glad we finally got to try here. I inferred that it is busy here on weekends, so I'm glad we came during the week around 1:30p. Wouldn't mind returning.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Reading some of the other reviews, it sounds like I was pretty fortunate with my timing. There was no line when I showed up. I did have to wait a little while for my food, but it seems like they're doing the best they can with what they have.  I had coconut pancakes with bacon and eggs. I order the eggs over medium and one of them showed up over hard. That's about where it stops when it comes to my complaints. The coconut pancakes were amazing and the bacon was cooked just the way I like it (and I didn't even have to tell them how I like it). The consistency of the pancakes was nice and soft, not like a normal place where you're basically gambling on whether or not they'll be overcooked. I also had a cappuccino and that was tasty.  The ambiance was pretty relaxed, with neat artwork on the walls and tables. People were working on their laptops, so there wasn't a ton of loud chatter around me. There was some chill music playing in the background at just the right volume. There's also an outdoor seating area that looks like it'd fun to hang out at. They have board games near the kitchen so they don't seem too opposed to folks lounging around.  The parking isn't great, but I'm kind of use to parking in neighborhoods and walking to get good food. I would come back here again!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Long waits, but you won't be disappointed. Make sure you do not go there already ""hangry"" because you will probably hurt someone. Bring a magazine, kick back and relax, enjoy the people watching and most of all THE AMAZING PANCAKES! :)",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Breakfast is wildly overpriced, slow, and doesn't taste that great. I got the beef hash which was marked as a special for the day. It was $20 for a large pacha latte (served from a refrigerated pitcher) and the hash. The hash was bizarrely sweet, it tasted a bit like sloppy Joe mix.  I wouldn't come back. The food is just OK but costs way too much. On a summer Saturday, expect to wait 30 minutes for food, probably longer when school is in session. There are way too many great places for breakfast in Austin to come back to this one.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Awesome food!  I'm always skeptical of places, but this place is great.  Friendly guy at the register with great atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Love this place. I've only been a couple times but it's so cute and homey inside. Coffee is always good, people are friendly, and they even have a good gluten free menu!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"We LOVE Pacha.  Will you have a wait on the weekends... Yes, but if you know what to order, the wait is well worth it. The pancakes are some of the best I've had.  I usually have banana or pear bacon scallion. Their omelettes are also delicious. The Greek omelette has been my go to. Now, the Pacha latte is my absolute favorite. I crave one about every day.  I've never been disappointed with the food or my experience. Yes, there is limited parking, as with most restaurants on Burnet, but you can park on the street and walk. It's really not a big deal at all.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"This is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch joints in town. It's cute, quirky, and f***ing DELICIOUS !! They have great coffee, quiche, pie, omelettes, and don't get my started on the bacon, pear, and scallion pancake. It gets a little crowded on the weekend, but the staff is always upbeat and friendly. You will not be disappointed !!!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Loved the espresso drinks and food!  Oh so good!  Plus, cute and ecclectic place to work at.  Parking is limited, so park on residential side streets.",1
Coffee Shop 50,Pacha was on point on a Saturday morning before heading to ACL. I had the Pear Bacon Pancake with chives. I was a little skeptical with all the different ingredients in this pancake but I am so glad I tried it. The mixture of sweet and salty is a great blend. I would recommend trying this pancake out to any pancake lover! The service was a bit slow but they were pretty well organized. The staff was extremely friendly as well and made the morning very pleasant! Doesn't break the bank either!,1
Coffee Shop 50,"Thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem. Initially, customer service was not impressive. We got in and did not know whether to order ourselves or someone would be by and give us the menu and take our orders. After a few minutes of waiting I decided to go to the counter and found out we have to put In our orders. Everything else was fantastic. The coffee was great probably one of the best I've ever had. We ordered French toast and the American breakfast and we were satisfied and full. One of the staff came by and gladly answered our questions and was very accommodating. I would be back and try the other items on their menu for sure. Overall, we were very happy The American breakfast. The sausage link was good! The French toast",1
Coffee Shop 50,"They use fresh and local ingredients and it shows.  Meats, eggs, cheese -- all excellent.  Food is done right.  The coffee drinks set this place apart as they are all prepared to perfection.  Everyone is friendly from the staff to the clientele -- people are just happy to be here.  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  The biggest thing for me is that the line ordering at the counter moves slowly.  They have so many food and coffee options (which is great from a meal perspective) and an ordering system that doesn't seem to be sufficient that it slows down the process.  Not a super huge deal as long as you know what you are getting into -- it's not a place where you can grab a quick bite.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"6 check-ins Listed in 100 reviews in 2014? Done and Done and Done., I'm pretty much a coffee shop expert. I like this place a lot... but you can't enjoy it because of the parking.  I love the hipstery venue, the staff and the coffee is great at Pacha... but when you can't park... or people have made parking spots around it to the point that half of your car is stuck holding up traffic while you have to go back and forth to not hit anything to get into the small alleyway that leads to the back where you either park in trash or not at all because there aren't spots, it becomes not worth it.  And yes, that run-on sentence was intentionally written to be as stressful as it is to find parking there.  If you can get in, you're looking at a solid 3.5-4 star experience... but odds are... and I'm speaking from experience 20% that you're going to find a space to park... and on a hot day, you might as well go to a place up the street like Genuine Joe that has a big enough parking lot to handle their customers to have a relaxing time. Sometimes when you park here, you park in a pile of eggshells.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Coolest coffee place in LoBurn hands down.  (Actually coolest restaurant in LoBurn hands down).  Best decorated coffee place on the north side hands down.  Not all the custom beverages are wonderful  but the Pacha latte and anything with Mexican chocolate is quite fine.  The basic coffee and espresso are quite fine.  Food excellent if it is cooked to order.  Food awful if semi-pre-made. Avoid empanadas and items in the display case.  There are not many places to sit - and the place is super super crowded.  So even though it is a wonderful wonderful place to sit and work all day and hang out all day - somebody someplace is going to want your table unless it is a rainy Wednesday.  Parking is impossible.  Ordering food takes             f    o     r     e     v     e    r.  The menu is incomplete. The boards are incomplete. The person taking your order is friendly, but chatty, and doing other things at the same time and the ordering system is cumbersome.  So lines   n  e  v  e  r    m  o  v  e  .  Then because it is a small kitchen, it just takes a long long time for your food to come.  But it is a beautiful room full of sunshine and Latin American art and happiness ...  so as long as you have the whole day in front of you and the sun is shining who cares.  One of my favorite coffee places in Austin - better for mellow conversations with friends and a yummy slow breakfast -  than barging in with deadlines on your mind and forty urgent work-related things to do on your computer.  However, if this is your day to write poetry on your computer -  Pacha's is a great choice.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Just left Pacha! Had a wonderful, chill lunch. The italian panino was great! Highly recommend.  the place is small but cozy. there was enough seating though. the staff is super friendly. small parking lot, but still got a spot. All of their items seem to be under $10. no complaints here!  Next thing to try is their coffee and fruit pancakes! :)",1
Coffee Shop 50,Probably the worst breakfast place I've ever been to! Kept me waiting 40 mins for a couple of the most expensive breakfast tacos I've ever had. Don't come here.,0
Coffee Shop 50,"The stuffed blueberry pancake is good, but not traditional. Try it if want something different, but don't expect diner pancakes. The hash is great, savory and delicious. My hubby and I went and tried both and they paired well together. The coffee is also great. Get there early, as the line gets longer & longer as the day goes on. Sooooo good.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"I have never eaten a better pancake.  I have also never waited as long for a pancake (only because the place is highly popular and busy).  The coffee is delicious.  The staff is very kind and helpful.  The atmosphere is charming.  It is pricy, but with this price you will be getting Quality.  Today I discovered that if you take home the pancake bacon and egg and eat it on the next day, having just chucked it in the fridge for 36 hours, you will still be consuming a delicious leftovers snack.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"I visited Austin for only four days and am so glad I chose to eat at Pacha over one of the many other great breakfast choices. You know that Food Network Show, ""Best Thing I Ever Ate?"" Eating the pear bacon scallion pancake at Pacha reminded me of that show. The place was beautifully decorated with artwork on every surface and the wifi information was displayed in multiple parts of the cafe. The service was wonderful, we even got some help finding our way back to our hotel. Definitely try Pacha. I know it will be hard to choose what to order, but you won't be disappointed with a pear bacon scallion pancake with eggs and a pacha latte. I miss it already",1
Coffee Shop 50,"Funky little coffee shop with a small menu of good stuff. The decor, the loose banter and dress of the staff, the free-flowing menu, everything about this place feels like the culmination of an old hippy's entire stock of capitalistic ambitions. But what's all that matter when they can make a Greek-styled breakfast bagel sandwich as goddamned tasty as this?!",1
Coffee Shop 50,"I love brunch, so naturally I had to try Pacha! It was my first time, and a friend and I split the pear pancake and the classic american breakfast plate. First of all, the restaurant itself is very cute and eccentric, very typical of a small Austin spot. There's also free wifi, which is a definite plus for a college student such as myself. I can definitely see myself working or studying there as the vibe is really chill and the staff is super nice and relatable! It was the middle of the day on a weekday, so limited seating may sometimes be a problem, but it wasn't for us. Waiting for the food didn't take long either.  Now to the real details. The pear pancake was incredible! It was huge and amazingly fluffy and literally melted in my mouth, and the pear addition to the flavor was so delicious. I'd never had anything like it, even compared to Kerbey Lane, though I've never tried pancakes at Magnolia Cafe. I love that they use fresh, organic ingredients at Pacha! It makes me feel a little less guilty about loving breakfast food. The sausage, eggs, and potatoes were cooked so nicely and the platter was really filling, so I think it's worth the money.  Didn't try the coffee there today, but I will definitely be back soon to do so! Cannot wait to come back and try all the different pancake flavors and probably the omelettes too. Would surely recommend this to anyone looking for a moderately priced brunch place that is super yummy.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"This is my 1st review but people need to know what to expect at Pachas. I took my date here last sat. for breakfast, we got a pancake, veggie omlet and beef hash as well as chai tea and a cappuccino. EVRYTHING was horrible. The food cost 43$! The cappuccino was undrinkable and taste like burnt wood it was so bad my date insisted on tasting it and choked on it, her tea was tastless. The food took close to an hour before we got it and evrything was soaked in grease and had a grey color too it. The eggs were egg substitute. Some of the servers appeared to be diseased and or stoned and was sweating profusely over the food...it was awful...and parking is equally horrible as they only have room for 3 or 4 cars in front parking area, we were expected to park 2 blocks away in the neighborhoods. The place is quaint and the patrons gave a good vibe...everything else, was truly horrible and grossly overpriced.  *Marjorie i would def appreciate a refund and will call this week,.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"We ordered food at 11:50 and didn't get our meal until 12:55. During our hour wait we were told ""10 minutes"" and then ""it's coming right out."" I prefer honesty over blowing your paying customers off by just telling us what we want to hear. There is insufficient seating and parking. The employees are very disrespectful. The cashier got onto us for not picking up our drinks soon enough. We couldn't find a place to sit so we had to go to the very back and sit behind the cars in their ""parking lot."" Because of this, I didn't pick them up fast enough. I am not sorry  I'm actually now very bothered that my business is an inconvenience to you. Your customers are the lifeline to your bottom line and you should treat them that way. Locked in the back of Pacha not being served. Thanks for the shitty customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Small, poorly ventilated, takes about 50-60 mins to get your food... Food portions were so/so and the food is good. Definitely not worth the wait. The staff is slow and doesn't follow sanitary guidelines. (Playing with hair)",0
Coffee Shop 50,"GET THE BANANA PANCAKES. You won't regret it. Unless you don't like bananas....then their other pancakes are good too! Their pacha latte is better cold, in my opinion. I'm a huge fan of iced coffee so I'm biased, but I got an iced pacha latte and it was great whereas my friend got it hot and it tasted slightly different..",1
Coffee Shop 50,"6 check-ins A great local spot to meet a friend for brunch. Seating space is limited (it's a small, bright yellow house) but I always manage to find a spot. Maybe I'm just lucky like that.  My favorite thing to order is an egg scramble. You can customize a scramble with dozens of meat, cheese, and veggie options. (You can do the same with a breakfast taco.) I usually order mine with goat cheese, spinach, and onion- delicious!  Staff has always been very friendly, even in the midst of a rush. They pride themselves on carrying many organic and local ingredients. Many vegan and gluten-free options as well. Their quiches are always very satisfying. I hear their stuffed pancakes are to die for- they are next on my list to try.  Update: have tried both the apple cinnamon and the blueberry pancakes, and they are in fact to die for! I've been ordering a half size pancake with one breakfast taco. A little sweet and a little savory.  My main issue (that becomes seemingly unimportant in the midst of their sheer awesomeness)- parking can be difficult. They have a teeny lot in the back that maybe holds five cars. I usually have to park a couple blocks away, which is no problem if the weather is good. Front of café (isn't it adorable?)",1
Coffee Shop 50,"I only had coffee here but I loved it and would definitely come back. It wasn't the best coffee I had in Austin but the atmosphere of the place made up for it and I would definitely try it again.

Coffee Shop 50,"2 check-ins Best breakfast place in Austin. Bacon, Pear, and Scallion Pancakes are my new favorite breakfast dish of all time. Pacha Latte and the Quiche are amazing too.",1
Coffee Shop 50,I came here for Sunday brunch because my friend recommended this place. And I would've enjoyed my experience there if it didn't take 2 HOURS to finally get the food.... It took about half an hour to order the food and another  hour and a half to get the food. The expected wait time was approximately 40 minutes when I walked in. I also don't understand how other tables were getting served before us even thought they had ordered after me. The food tasted good but I didn't have much time to actually enjoy it as I was starving by the time the food came to me. Hope service improves for future customers.,0
Coffee Shop 50,"Updated review Can I give negative stars?!? I thought I would give this place one more try, I was just asking for it!!Ruined our morning! When we got there it was crowded, but I had no idea we would wait over 1 hour for our breakfast after we ordered! It really is a shame how rude they treated people coming in for a nice breakfast! Just WRONG!",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Takes forever. It is more like a coffee chop than cafe. The food was decent but way over priced. I paid $37 for some French toast and eggs, an all American breakfast and two coffee. I was under the impression this was more of a cafe style but not the case. You wait in line for like 30 min and it takes another 40 to get your food. It's ridiculous and not worth the time or money",0
Coffee Shop 50,"Pacha is great! I love that the coffee is fairtrade, and most of the food is organic/local.  My favorites are the iced Pacha Latte (coffee frappe, boosted with banana so it's a good breakfast on the go) and the daily quiche.  The baristas are always friendly and joking around. Can get pretty packed on the weekend, but its a great work/homework spot during the week, with solid wifi.",1
Coffee Shop 50,"I'm subtracting stars for the hour long wait, lack of communication about free coffee offered when the ETA of food is over 30 minutes (c'mon, would a note under the ""average wait time for orders"" chalkboard be so difficult?) and the faulty Paypal promotion. If I check out this space again, it'll be on a weekday morning. Honestly, two months later, I can't remember what I ordered or how anything tastes. Maybe give this place awhile to lose some hipness and to get their PayPal system in working order. PayPal incentive",0
Coffee Shop 50,"The staff is extremely friendly and energetic. I ordered an egg white omelette with spinach, mushrooms, grilled onions and potatoes. It was so flavorful and despite my obsession with hot sauce it really did not even need it. Hubby ordered the beef hash with over easy eggs.

I ordered the pear & bacon pancake with a scrambled egg. The food took a while to come out but that's because they are making it fresh with real ingredients. The egg hit the spot. The kind of egg you'd get from a home cooked meal. Then there's the pancake. Holy moly I could go on forever about how good this pancake was. Everyone should check this place out if only to try their pancakes, but it's a place I will definitely be revisiting.",1

Coffee Shop 50,"Really enjoyed the food here! The pacha latte was delicious, I added an extra shot and it was full of flavor.

Otherwise the other person who took my breakfast order was very pleasant! My only complaint is it didn't seem air conditioned and it was hot as hell. Swiss mix omelette. Really really good.

Coffee Shop 50,I love this little place. It's tiny and tucked away and parking is hit or miss but it's so worth it. The quality of food and coffee is fantastic so if it's a little pricier it's fine and so worth it. I love health conscious little cafe/coffee houses like this. So much charm and character - perfect place to grab a snack and coffee or sit out on the back porch with a friend for breakfast.,1

Coffee Shop 61,"With great coffee drinks, google fiber internet, plenty of open space with available seating and a quiet room for more intense studying this place this is a great coffeeshop in the south austin area.

Overall, i'd recommend it if you're in the area and need to get some stuff and want a good drink while working.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I've been here twice to work.  The coffee isn't bad.  There is plenty of parking and tables to work.  I really like that there is a quiet room for when you need to concentrate.  The two stars are for the cleanliness.  The floors were filthy and the bathrooms were disgusting.  They smelled strongly of urine.  There was a thick layer of dust covering the handicap ""grab bar."" The soap dispenser did not work in two different bathrooms.  I have to assume this is where the staff that makes your food and drinks also uses the restroom. How are they washing their hands?

Coffee Shop 61,"I love the atmosphere of the coffee shop.  They are always changing their art.  My problems?  Staff is ALWAYS talking too much-amongst themselves and with customers, so it takes forever to get served.  Very annoying, especially when there are only one or two people in front of you.  In addition, pastries and other goodies in front are almost always dry-so I don't bother.  I definitely get pastries at other coffee shops-but I have learned that their pastries are never really fresh, so I don't bother here.  Also FYI-their WiFi runs on a password-which they only change once every 6 weeks, if that.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"Think I'm getting too old for places like this. Coffee is ok, music is nice, but it's incredibly grungy - to the point of filthy and dusty. Bare walls, zero aesthetic, cavernous, dark, depressing, ripped and stained and covered with grime.",0

Coffee Shop 61,"I'm a quasi regular, I guess. Pretty much every time I come in, everything is on point. I just went in to get a drink before work. Now that I've gotten to work and I've actually tried my coffee, the shots taste old. Like, as if they were sitting on the bar longer than they should have been before getting thrown into a drink. I should have guessed since my drink was done before I even finished signing my receipt. The cashier was cool. He always is. The barista was short with me in the most passive way. Brief eye contact, lack of verbal communication - instead of telling my dumb ass there were wrapped muffins to go right in front of me, he reached around the counter pastry case, pointed at one and gave me a half second of piercing eye contact. Single syllable responses and swift impatient head nods make crappy customer service.  The coffee isn't totally on the cheap end, and I'm stuck at work now with something that tastes like stale burned dark coffee and baking cocoa. The drink was also short, which didn't help offset the taste of three old shots.  Recently I'd thought about applying as there's a hiring sign posted, but if I were - I would not work well with such an obviously catty employee who serves bad drinks on purpose, or just isn't good at making them to begin with.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"I gave you a one because your toilet and urinal were stained with drops of urine. Come on, you can keep it cleaner than that!

This makes me wonder how clean you are behind the scenes and how often your employees wash their hands.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"I ordered a red eye with almond milk. I grabbed two pieces of pumpkin bread (smallest slices ever, hence the two). Handed over my card. They don't take AmEx. Look for a clean table to sit down and work, eventually found a semi-clean one next to a filthy wall. Finally take a drink of the coffee after figuring out which of the too many wireless options will work. Coffee is sour, bland. Open the pumpkin bread #1. DRY. Open pumpkin #2. DRY.  Next time someone asks me to drive from north Austin to south Austin for a coffee meeting, I'll do the suggesting. And it won't be this place.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"The owner or the guy who counts the tilt is a jerk.  The jerk slams his fist on the table and say""hey buddy you can't sleep here"". Okay my bad. Turns out I asked the guys behind the counter what the big deal was with my eyes closed for a minute. Turns out this elite owner group comes in here often to harass people and little kids. The barista was telling me a kid bought a snow cone across the street, came in with his mom to get her coffee, and these social elite egos kicked the kid out for having a snow cone with him. Oh an the owner of the snow cone place is the one who made the big fuss plus it turns out he was once a part owner in this coffee spot. I guess it's called Strange Brew because of the strange people who own it.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"Fine place to see a show, they serve beer and wine only and it's very reasonably priced. Only craft beers on tap. I wouldn't come here for the coffee, though.  4 Stars for the polite and efficient door guys and concert cops. Bartenders were nothing but smiles.",1

Coffee Shop 61,"Coffee is OK, nothing special.  Older crowd tends to hang around, sometimes a lot of parents with young kids.  Breakfast food is pretty bad, had a stale old muffin that was inedible.  Overall has a dirty underwhelming vibe.",0
Coffee Shop 61,Quality of the prepared coffee is not good at all. Pastries are almost never fresh  and the environment is pretty good  for working with your laptop.  Dusty and dirty almost on every corner. I give ONLY 1 star because the quality of the coffee must be excellent in a place like that.,0
Coffee Shop 61,"Strange Brew used to be a pretty cool place to be. I found it laid back, good people watching and friendly.  But unfortunately I think they are going downhill. The last few times I have been there it's been pretty empty. I heard that you could buy iced coffee in jugs to go, and asked for one, and they said they were out of containers to pour it in and would be for the forseeable future.  The music was on for 10 minutes, then off for an hour. When I finally asked, he said the player was broken and very spotty. Next time I came in, no music. So there's just this air about the place now of falling into disrepair. Not sure what's going on, but very disappointing.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"I live this place! 24 hours a day there is a nice person ready to make me a sandwich and pour me a cup of something good. Since I work mostly nights it's good to know this place is here and I can get some delicious home cooked food at a decent price. My favorite is, hands down, the croissant sandwich with Turkey and bacon.",1
Coffee Shop 61,As nice as the two gentlemen working were and what a big room to sit/study...I have to say the large latte wasn't good. I found it watery and dumped it when I got home. Too bad.,0
Coffee Shop 61,"This place is awesome!! I am glad I decided to stop by for dinner and try this place for the first time. When you enter, you will see multiple rooms - the venue, room for ordering food or drinks, a lounge, and a quiet area designated for studying. I cannot give an opinion on the venue because I stopped by during the daytime, but for other rooms, it definitely is perfect for anyone who needs to get some work done during the day or just relax. I ordered hot coffee with creamer and toffee syrup, as well as the Italian panini. The food was VERY good. As someone who is not a crazy fan of pastries or donuts, I liked the variety of the menu. If you're in the mood for some savory food, you will definitely find it here. The baristas also were very friendly when I ordered my dinner.  Speaking of ordering - you can also sit down at a table and scan a QR code to text your order! It might not seem like a big deal, but I am deaf, so anything like this definitely helps to faciliate communication for better service. I would definitely say this place is ""deaf friendly"" just because of that. Overall I now have a new favorite place near my home, will gladly recommend this place to anyone, and bring my friends here next time. I love how you can sit down at a table and actually text your order. This is definitely ""deaf-friendly"" for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 61,"For a 24 hours study lounge, I really like Strange Brew. A lot. I'm not even sure if I would say I prefer their coffee, but compared to Epoch and Bennu, the place is way less crowded and a really nice drive to and from campus. Meaning, when you want to leave, you really have to make the effort of wanting to leave (which then, I hope, should propel you to continue with your studies).  Upon entering Strange Brew, to your left is a live music lounge for those chill nights. My nights are never chill, and I have yet to actually visit for the music alone--but hey, at least you get the option. The music is loud when you order, and I was afraid it would be loud when I studied but once you enter the study area, the music dissipates into background noise. Nice.  I like Strange Brew because I NEVER have to worry about parking, and I have yet to come and never find a seat--which is, honestly, the worst things about Bennu and Epoch. So Strange Brew is a little far from UT campus (10-15 minutes?), but it's worth the drive (to me).  The study area is big with lots of open space. Tons of tables. Tons of seats. And, people are usually gone by 12/1 AM, giving even plenty more seats/tables to choose from. A little on the dim side, but there's an even quieter and brighter silent study room with a door to shut off the world!  Their espresso/coffee is hot. Like, scalding hot. It takes a while for it to cool down. Their Strange Brew was really good--I quite enjoyed it. It kind of reminded me of Epoch/La Tazza Fresca's vanilla latte but WAY better, less sweet, and creamier. I also previously tried their iced vanilla latte, and I feel like it could have been good... with more espresso, less milk, and less ice. So maybe I'll ask them to switch some stuff around next time, lol.  Only thing I really don't like is that there's only one cashier, so it sometimes takes a while to even order your drink, especially bc of the fact that they brew/create your drink right then and there before they charge you (aka, holding up the line even more). It's alright though because the baristas are just so friendly!  Also, their wi-fi is a little jank. It takes a while for it to get working, and once it starts, it's a little laggy and goes in and out. But once it starts up, it stays pretty consistent--although, this could also be because people have disappeared by 2 AM and less people means better wi-fi. Who knows.  All in all--for a study lounge, I would say Strange Brew has been my favorite so far. Thumbs up, Strange Brew.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"So... This place is tough to review. The concept is interesting, sort of a hodgepodge mix of someone's interests. I can only guess the owner wanted to do a bunch of things and the randomly decided ""why not do all of it in one place?"" Which seems sort of ok, until you're having a cup of coffee with a friend and people keep leaning right over your table to squint at a painting on the wall because your coffee bar is inconveniently located in the middle of their art show. Or, when you're getting a beer at the bar... But have to wait for your bartenderista to make a latte and macha frapawhateva before they can hand you a can of beer. Or when they have live music and the website says tickets are at the door, but when you get there the angry old guy chews you out (unprovoked) because you should have bought tickets online... While he sits at a ticket booth jammed directly in the doorway which is NOT marked sold out. In addition to the music ticket booth being directly in the way of the entrance, the staff asks the line for their tiny coffee bar with one register to walk away from the door to the back of the room because the bar/coffeebar/register/kitchen is also awkwardly located just a few steps inside the front door. The coffee is only so-so and the baristas/bartenders are nice enough, but overall it's less than worth the hassle most of the time. It's really ideal for people needing hours of free wifi for the cost of a cup o joe. So... Stoners & students... That's about it.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"Great place to see live music. The listening room is small, but acoustics are awesome. Plan to get there early if you want a seat. The shows are reasonably priced, and their Sunday morning show is awesome-and helps fund the food bank via donations and part of the proceeds from purchasing mimosas. They have food, beer (tap and bottle), and wine.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"This coffee shop is so relaxing and vibrant. I've come here countless times to get work done, meet up with friends, clients, and just to get some great tasting products! I love their coffee, teas, and treats.  They also have a room devoted to live bands and solo artists which is always fun to check out! They feature local artists paintings/art on the walls which makes it feel very local. The back porch is great to for a sunny day :)",1
Coffee Shop 61,"As students, this is my boyfriend and I's go-to study spot. We're here about twice a week. I'll admit that the lounge/coffee shop matchup is interesting, and the sound definitely permeates through the coffee shop, BUT I'm very impressed at how quiet they're able to keep the study room.  Like any coffee shop, the need for outlets and better wifi is there, but you really can't beat the place that's open 24 hours.  Never ventured to the music side, but perhaps I will someday! For now I'll listen through the walls while I sip my tea (lots of variety, very nice loose-leaf teas) and study.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Not only do they have great coffee, but they're  cheap in comparison to most other places *cough* Starbucks. AND open 24/7. What more could you want??",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Service very slow and served with an attitude (the gentleman behind the counter was obviously angry at something - no smiles, not attentive and complaining to his colleague) They didn't have my first two choices of drinks (little to no tea options left and smoothie flavours out). I ordered a biscuit with sausage which took longer than expected to arrive (though they were busy due to my group) only to then find it was a jalapeno biscuit (no mention on the menu of that) and they had forgotten to add the sausage so it was just egg...I don't work in a coffee shop but don't think it's that hard to have stock, serve with a smile and then get the order right...",0
Coffee Shop 61,One of the best latte's in town.  Great music venue. Hate the barbed wire in the back.,1
Coffee Shop 61,"6 check-ins I've been to Strange Brew several times and service has always been spotty but today was downright disappointing. When I inquired about our our order the guy says, ""it's just coming off the grill."" I wait for it and he puts one sandwich up for me to take. Not only did it take 20+ minutes to make a breakfast sandwich, they were supposed to make two of them. I bring this to another guys attention who responds with, ""I wasn't aware, I just got here."" Wow, ok. So the guy who originally took my order starts making the other sandwich and I decide to wait up front while my family is eating their food. It takes all of 5 minutes to make it and he sets it on the counter. Another customer walks up to grab it when he says it's my order. Instead of letting me know that my food was ready he decided to chat with some dude who didn't appear to be a customer...nice. No apology or attempt to make up for the terrible customer service, great job guys! Makes me want to go back REAL SOON. The two stars is for the food only but that won't take me back any time soon.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"Honestly can't say anything bad about this place. It's different and friendly, I like that. It's our second time here and this time we enjoyed the music lounge. While waiting in line and deciding what to get for a drink, a local customer suggested the aristocrat. It's a frozen coffee blend that was the best that has ever graced my taste buds. I loved it! It's $10 for entry to see the local bands and that's for all night, come and go as you please. It's awesome. I like the atmosphere, I like the dark lighting and the intimate setting near the stage. I will admit this will probably only swing with some crowds, not all but my husband, cousin and I(ranging from early to late 20's) quite enjoyed it. If you like local music, or music in general check it out. This is a part of Austin I wish we had back home.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"2 check-ins Simplicity at it's finest.  A no fuss, bare bones hang out space  with quality coffee, food, and drinks.  I was looking for a space to work virtually for several hours while waiting for my dog to be groomed, and dreaded having to just go to a Starbucks.  I was overjoyed to find Strange Brew.  It reminded me of all the awesome study spaces I used to haunt that got bought out and torn down by land developers in Seattle near the Univ. of WA.  This place even had a section for live music in the evenings.    I loved how everything here was just simple. It looks like they have slowly expanded as space has come available in the strip mall, connecting one empty retail spot to the next.  It's quite large once you get inside, and it's nice because each former retail space has a bathroom.  The final room on the end is a quiet study room with no music and lots of work stations near plug ins.  I like the local artists they highlight for sale on the walls.  They do have a modest outdoor space in the back that is dog friendly, and has limited sun shade.    You cannot eat or drink anything from outside.  So it's good they have a small variety of items to choose from.  They have a light menu of sandwiches and items to order, that they will make and call out your number.  There is a shelf with some prepackaged snacks -some are gluten friendly.  Also, there is a cold case with various drinks and beers, and a small selection of wine.  For a sweeter taste they have some pastries near the cashier.  Don't miss the Misty Morning Bakery Vegan/Gluten free cookies pre-wrapped in the basket by the pastries- the oatmeal raisin was one of the BEST I have had in awhile.  So what about the Brew?  I have saved the best for last.  The majority of morning patrons were lined up to get the drip coffee here.  I didn't get a chance to try that.  I instead tested the espresso.  Which was strong, and all things great about good espresso.  I loved the large selection of milk alternatives to choose from.  The hibiscus tea was refreshingly- not sweet.  Plus, the mixed iced coffee I took away when I left was the icing on the cake.  Yes, the Wi-Fi was free with purchase of food or beverage.  Just ask the cashier and a code is printed for you.  It was strong and steady.  You just need to request a new one after four hours.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  I will definitely be back the next time my pups needs a cut.

Coffee Shop 61,"If you start with a beer and finish with the Jelly Doughnut steamer (trust me, try it), it's like you had dinner and dessert. Comfortable and easy-going, you have permission to come as you are. There's a study room if you need quiet but much more fun to do your coffee sipping/people watching/eavesdropping/pretending to work in the main rooms where the action is. The Lounge next door gives you the live music option if you decide to scrap the work pretense altogether. Go ahead and come to Strange Brew when you just shouldn't be at home anymore. It's okay, they understand, it's open 24 hours.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"One of my most cherished haunts since I was a teenager. A 24 hour place with the coziest vibes and the most chill, welcoming staff you could hope for at a coffee joint. Their cold brew can get addicting, but the best thing is that this space features both a music venue and a quiet study area. The clientele is also something to boast about- you can always find someone interesting to talk to here.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I love this place. I've been coming for 3 years, since I moved into the neighborhood. It's 24 hours and the double strangebrew with white chocolate is dreamy. The guys behind the counter always remember me and my modifications. I love that it's always a familiar face. I've watched them expand over and over. It's cool to see them grow. The Internet was my only complaint about this place but the situation has been fixed and now my phone automatically connects to the wifi when I walk in. They seem to have heard and understood people's frustration with the system and will never do that again. I think they should focus on developing the backyard more. It's a great space but needs some love and thought. Some plants would help, more seating or something decorative and welcoming. These are just ideas though. Strangebrew is my favorite coffee shop in town. Lots of seating and tables",1
Coffee Shop 61,Loved studying here in the designated study room. It's so quiet. It's the best of both worlds: a coffee shop and library study room all in one! I hear they have pretty cool music and events to! Def check it out,1

Coffee Shop 61,"10 check-ins Listed in Southside - ATX I can not believe it has taken this long to finally stop in at Strange Brew.  I have been curious about it many times.  It is open 24 hours and every time I drive by, at all hours of the day, it looks like there are always people there.  I guess I did not stop in until recently because I am not a fan of coffee - at all.  I never drink it.  I do not like coffee flavored anything!  I am however a new fan of Strange Brew.    My fiance came home one day and told me he stopped in and ordered the peanut butter mocha frozen drink and it was one of the best things on earth for him.  He said he wanted to take me in to check it out.  Within the next couple of days we did just that.  I ordered the white chocolate frozen drink - it was surprisingly very tasty and refreshing!  I thought it was a good alternative for when I may be craving ice cream.  The barista was friendly and able to carry on a conversation as he made our drinks.  I also noticed the delicious looking cinnamon rolls sitting out.  I almost got one, but resisted.  On my second visit I ordered the chai frozen drink and it was just as delicious as the white chocolate.  I had decided ahead of time if they had the cinnamon rolls out I would get one, but they did not.  Oh well next time - I am sure I will be back!    The atmosphere here is pretty chill each time I have stepped in.  Looks like there is plenty of seating and free wifi.  There is also some seating outside as well.  Strange Brew has bought out many of the shops and continued to expand over the time they have been there and they have have the Strange Brew lounge side.  I have not checked this out yet, but will at some point I am sure.  I heard they also bought the Bakehouse building and am looking forward to what they will do with that.  I am glad I finally discovered this little gem in my neighborhood and I am excited to try some other fancy drinks and pastries (non coffee drinks of course).",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Probably the best ice coffee I've ever had. We didn't have time to hang out, but definitely a laid back vibe and plenty of room to just chill. Oh, and they also sell beer!",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I want to love Strange Brew...and there are things that I do like about it. It's the only coffee shop remotely close to my neighborhood, it's 24 hrs, free WiFi, a ""quiet"" study area, they showcase local artists and they've expanded their business to do cool things like supporting live music and opening a restaurant. These are all very cool things..but there are some things about the place that are ""meh"" and a couple of things that seriously f'n suck.  The coffee and food are okay. A couple of things are really good--the peanut-butter frap drink and the ""strange brew"" drink come to mind--but everything else I've had is basically standard barista fair: decent and about what you'd expect (a.k.a. much better than 7/11 coffee but not appreciably different from any other coffee house.)  And there is almost always a line for service, which isn't a big deal, but it can get really long and when it does, they don't handle the volume especially efficiently. Most of the baristas are friendly, though, and acknowledge the long wait.  The first thing that drives me nuts about the place is the smell--I'm not exaggerating when I say it smells funky ALL of the time.  There is a faint moldy, mildewy funk about the seating area rooms and especially the quiet study room.  I've been several times--in different months and in different weather conditions---it's just an old building that has deep-seated mold issues. After awhile you stop noticing it so much but whenever I first arrive, it hits me like a wall and I have visions of toxic black fungi particles wafting thru the air.  The second thing that drives me nuts is the live music that's pumped into the main seating area.  9 out of 10 people in those rooms are there to study---not check out a live band.  It's distracting in a couple of ways. First, live music isn't the same kind of back-ground hum as an album or Pandora station (what they usually have pumping through the speakers.) There is a conversational, staccato, and noise level variance to live shows that make it an anathema to background sound.  What's worse though is that the live shows sound levels are actually attenuated in such a way that they come through the the room speakers a few decibels louder than the Pandora stations.  I repeat---almost everyone there is there to quietly study, NOT to listen to a live show.  I've complained about it and I was told that there ""was nothing they could do about it.""  If it was a Friday or Saturday night, I wouldn't even have complained.  But this will happen during the middle of the day on a Sunday--it doesn't matter. If there is a band playing, everyone in the building has to listen to it. Why Strange Brew wants to force everybody in the building to listen to the live music, too, is beyond me.  If it's a marketing idea, it's a bad one.  It's worth nothing that the ""quiet"" room doesn't have speakers. The noise from the speakers in the next room do bleed in there as well and as aforementioned, it's the smelliest room in the joint. It's also rather poorly lit. The main seating area is much more comfortable.  I honestly think that a good deal of the popularity of the Strange Brew is a direct result of the fact that those of us who live in south of Ben White Blvd. have precious few options in the ways of coffee houses (and bars and music venues for that matter.)  Strange Brew is helping fill a much needed void---and I'm grateful for that. They are clearly promoting art and culture in South Austin and I truly find that both admirable and great for the community.  But I dearly wish some other businesses would come help fill the void to give us additional options.  Are there any entrepreneurs out there reading this? Please come open a truly student friendly coffee house in South Austin!!!  I, for one, will never return to Strange Brew again...unless there's a band a wanna check out.  That said, I am still eagerly anticipating the opening of their new restaurant. My fingers are crossed for the owners that all is going well and on track.  I hope the food is good---if it is, I will become one the first regulars.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"Hip place that gives you a choice of a chilled coffee bar, study room or a music filled atmosphere.  We enjoyed our drinks and just lounging around.  It's south of the main austin scene but definitely worth visiting if you just want a nice drink and a place to hang.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Great venue. Wonderful acoustics and a great listening experience (small venue, easy access, parking). We LOVE Strange Brew.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I really loved this place. They've got a little bit of everything! Cozy study spaces inside- a lot of students come here to take advantage of those. Then it's got a cool patio section outside with plenty of tables. Still good for private conversation and dates. Lastly it's got a wicked cool live music section that's closed off so as not to disturb the study environment.  It's got it all!  Good IPA beers and for the vegans in the city: they've got a large selection of milk alternatives. Coconut milk, rice milk, hemp milk as well as the classic soy and almond. Definitely refreshing to see!  Really friendly staff as well! I'd love to go back!",1

Coffee Shop 61,"Okay, so the Strange Brew coffee concoction itself is what I like to come here for.  It's fatty mcfatterson, but OH SO GOOD.  Honestly, I have never had the desire to drink anything else here because it's that good.  Although I don't frequent this area much, I do like stopping by here once in a while.  Jamey is an awesome coffee aficionado, and everyone else also really knows what they're doing.  It's very chill, and to all the haters who don't like the decor, most everyone who goes there has their face planted in a book, so it really doesn't matter all that much.  It's nice that they have a study room dedicated to the intense crammer, and they have a back patio area that's nice. If the decor is not good enough for you inside, you can sit on the patio closer to the evening and watch the fireflies light up here and there.  I was so mesmerized by the fireflies that I kind of stopped listening to my friend's conversation with me and she basically had to repeat everything before I could respond properly.  I blame it on ADHD.  Doesn't everyone these days?",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I love Strange Brew! They are 24 hours, which in Austin can be tough to find.

They are supremely kind and considerate, and ALWAYS helpful.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I come here often to enjoy a cup of black coffee and there 'Italian"" sandwich....usually because it's quiet and they provide free wifi on the weekends, which I've found some other coffee joints refuse to do(radio cough cough). Today started out quiet, but I've discovered there is apparently a music venue right next door and they have live music!! As I'm listening through my headphones it sounds a little mellow, but there's definitely a drum set. Prices are reasonable here and that Italian sandwich is always delicious. Update : the live music is part of strange brew!",1
Coffee Shop 61,"So, overall I like this place but there are a few major downers.  The atmosphere is a great coffee house, super chill, great artwork and bands. Nice space. Coffee is delicious, I really dig good coffee.  Drawbacks: Two hour internet limit -- this is fine, I don't mind paying. BUT it's SO SLOW. How do you have this system and yet have internet that is so slow? I can barely do any work here because it's like the internet is constipated. The servers always seem rude, and like they're better than me and I should know everything about this place already. I've been here at least five times and every single time I'm made to feel like I'm not welcome. Outlets. There is a lot of space but half the outlets seem to be taped over or removed. I don't understand why. So not only do I get kicked off the internet after two hours, my laptop is also going to die at some point.    Drawbacks outweigh the good things and basically it's hard to stay here for longer than two hours, which is apparently what they want. Sad, but true.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"24-hour laid-back South Austin coffee shop with live music. More parking and room inside and outside than Epoch on North Lopp with a similar vibe, though the clientele skews older, and the parking lot fills up when they have a popular act on the Lounge Side, so expect to park next door at Bake House on weekend nights. The Lounge Side features live music and usually charges a cover, but the coffee shop side includes 2 seating areas to chat with friends, play games and do work with plugs along the walls, and a quiet study room. There is free wifi, but it's not the most reliable. They sell coffee, espresso drinks, Italian soda, bottled juices, beer & wine until midnight, and food includes paninis, premodern salad or quiche, pie by the slice and pastries & bagels. The staff is excellent but there is only one register to order so the line can get long. We love to come to work on our laptops outside in the back, which features picnic tables with umbrellas and a canopy and a large fan, but unfortunately they're down to only 2 available outlets so it can get pretty ""crowded"" with only a few people who need to plug in their devices. The other downside is the outlets are right behind the Lounge Side, so when people step out for a smoke break from the Live Music they fill up the work space. Also the wifi is pretty sporadic, so you have to be prepared for it to be unreliable and be able to work offline or save your progress often (for example, this is the second draft of this review because the wifi went out when I tried to submit my first).

Coffee Shop 61,"If the music is good as their Strange Brew Coffee, I'm in! Coffee is one of a kind, rich in flavor.  This place has a classic South Austin vibe and I love that it so close to my old high school.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I like Strange Brew mainly because they are open 24/7 and they have a terrific music venue. The regulars here are friendly. The coffee house is spacious and the quiet area is useful.  However, like many gathering places in Austin, it gets crowded. The parking lot gets crowded too. I could not imagine trying to study here during busy hours, yet many people do. You may have to wait in a long line to order during peak hours, although the staff works at a fast pace to accommodate the customers.  There are usually smokers out front which means you will get smoke on your clothes when you enter and exit. This is unfortunate, but pretty standard for any bar, coffee house, or music venue in Austin.  The wi-fi is slow during peak hours, too. There is not a lot of bandwidth for the amount of traffic.  In a nutshell, I like this place but always avoid it during busy hours. I appreciate the quality of the music they present. Their wi-fi has served me well during late nights and early mornings.",1
Coffee Shop 61,44 check-ins My wife and I love coming here! I love the regular cold brew and my wife loves the frozen mocha with coffee. The pastries here are awesome! I just wished they would have fried pickles LOL oh and the snow cone trailer outside is awesome too!!,1
Coffee Shop 61,"Pros: -Open 24/7!! -Extremely spacious -Separate ""quiet lounge"" area -Separate room for live music -Most people are working/studying  Cons: -Ill-lit, decor and furnishings are nothing special -Ordered a small House blend drip coffee, interesting blend of flavors but was way too watered down to really enjoy -WiFi cuts in and out -Located in a strip of shops, so the parking lot is usually packed (but the building next door closed down, so there are usually parking spots there)",0
Coffee Shop 61,One of my favorite coffee shops to work remotely at and they even have a quiet room! Place is legit :),1
Coffee Shop 61,"This place was recommended to me by my leasing agent when I moved South. However, I've been twice and had bad experiences both times. Apparently if you don't look hip enough, you don't get good service. The staff were dismissive and snobby both times and the products overpriced and inferior.",0
Coffee Shop 61,3 check-ins Love their coffee. They have so many milk alternatives and they aren't judgey about it. They even have coconut milk! Woohoo!!  They have their cold brew down to a T. It's sooooo good. I'll be buying growlers of it soon.  They're always super friendly and there's tons of parking available.,1
Coffee Shop 61,"107 check-ins I love Strange Brew! Sure, their prices are higher than the other local coffee shops but they are open 24 hours & that in itself is awesome! Even the corporate coffee chains in the area don't stay open 24 hours. I discovered this place in 2011 when I used to live in the neighborhood & still occasionally stop by. What amazes me is how much they've grown throughout this time. This ""tiny coffeehouse"" has since taken up space on either side, now consuming much of the former shopping center it's located in. To the left is the ""Lounge Side"" music venue, which I believe has it's own check in. They have a smal bar & live music nightly. There's almost always a cover charge but if they're hosting a musician whose familiar to you, it's totally worth checking out.   To the right are multiple seating rooms, great for small meetings & gatherings. As Chiqui B noted in 2011, Strange Brew didn't offer much seating in it's humble beginnings but they do have plenty of seating now & a few bike racks for those who prefer alternative transportation... Which leads me to their parking situation. SB does have a big parking lot but good luck finding parking during the afternoon/evenings, especially when a well-known artist is performing. I've had no trouble finding parking in the AM but have passed on the opportunity to give the business my support during the afternoons many times due to the lack of a parking space. If you're looking for a South Austin coffee shop that's local & on the other side of Ben White or Oltorf St, this is the place! Lounge side",1
Coffee Shop 61,"It's 5am and I need GREAT iced espresso! Strange brew to the rescue. A laid back neighborhood setting, and a greeting called from the barista as a walk through the door. I ordered the hex iced, and a breakfast croissant. Well executed. The 10% check-in discount is a bonus.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"This is a deceptively large spot. Great crowd, awesome outdoor patio in the back... wine, beer, coffee... what else could someone want? they have snacks as well.. this is where you come to relax, have a beverage and unwind. They are even open 24 hours as well and you can bring your dog! The only thing that needs to change is the way you have to access the internet. It's horrible.. you ready for this.. here we go -  1- Make a purchase at the counter and ask for internet access, you will be given a receipt with a username and password.  2- Connect to the wireless network (strange brew login)  3- Enter network password (strangebrew)  4- Start browser and you will be prompted to enter the User ID and password on your receipt.  Then a little ""information"" window pops up with a countdown on time starting at 2 hours.  C'mon maaaannn!!!  Sweet baby jesus it's 2014 and this ain't no Fort Knox.  All in all one of my favorite coffee shops to come though.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Best coffee bar I've found in Austin. Nice baristas, great coffee and pastries. Dedicated quiet room, nice patio. Wifi has always functioned well for me.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"The WiFi never works, so don't come here to work or study. I came here more than half a year ago and left because I didn't get a wireless signal. I gave it another shot today and it still doesn't work. No it's not my computer because my phone didn't register a signal either. And no it's not the capacity or amount of people at the coffeeshop; I've worked fine out of Dominican Joe's, where there is usually twice as many people.  The coffee is good, so come in for a to-go cup or to simply read a book. People nowadays visit coffeeshops for some combination of the coffee, the atmosphere, and the ability to work or study and this coffeeshop severely lacks in the last area. If you're looking for other 24/hr coffeeshops, I only know of Bennu Coffe up on MLK which is pretty good.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"11 check-ins ROTD How have I never been to this place before last week? Because I live so stinkin' far north of it. It took an evening live music show to enlighten me, and even then I was expecting the usual coffee house show, where the band crams themselves into an awkward corner and you shout your orders above the squawky sound system. No.  Strange Brew is strange perhaps because it rises above the typical coffee shop in its offerings. The main room houses the coffee and sandwich bar with a few diner-style tables. The middle, adjoining room houses rows of tables occupied with college students from nearby ACC, all studying quietly on computers and surrounded by four walls hung with the quirky paintings of a local artist. The far room has the stage, backed by heavy red velveteen curtains and strategic rack and ambient theatrical lighting, and surrounded by a nice array of tables and chairs. It's like hanging out in someone's living room for an intimate show. It reminds me of a smaller version of The Cactus on the UT campus.  We ordered panini sandwiches (the veggie ""Hippie"" is delicious, with goat cheese, tomato, and pesto), Vickie's salt & vinegar chips, and bottomless cups of creative hot herbal teas. The craft beers were a welcome surprise as well. I noticed quiche and pastries in the case, and coffee, so it's not like you couldn't get your usual coffee shop fare if you wanted to.  People who live close by are certainly lucky, because Strange Brew is open 24-7. The employees are bright and friendly, and it's a beautiful atmosphere to spend time in. I just wish they would open one up here in Four Points at the Trails at 620, or maybe in that half-empty strip mall in front of the Home Depot. We don't have a good coffee shop with a study spot, or an intimate concert venue. Hint, hint... Well, it's worth a try, anyway. Can you blame me?  **mini-update: As of December 21, they have knocked out the wall between the lounge and the study area. The latter is gone, and the lounge now seats about 160 in 7 rows of chairs; no tables remain. There is a mini-bar in the back corner, and servers make the rounds for those who don't want to get up for food or drinks. You can bring food over from the cafe side.",1
Coffee Shop 61,This place is sooooo Austinish. So one side is a bar with live music and all. The other side is pretty much a coffee shop with lot of overpriced paintings (there are some good paintings tho). It's very hipster I have to say. The best thing bout this place is that you can order beer in a coffee shop which is cool af. Also it is open 24 hours!! So that's super convenient. The drinks are a ok. I had a Italian soda but I've had better at other places. It's okay. But the service is great. Maybe I'll get coffee or something next time but def not Italian soda lol. Will be back again!,1
Coffee Shop 61,"Updated review 2 check-ins Stopped here today for the first time to check out the Saturday morning kids show and have some breakfast. Kids show was packed, not surprising on a rainy Saturday (someone had a birthday party in the audience). Got a 10% off yelp offer for checking in (excludes alcohol, but for the love of God, who needs alcohol at 10am on a Saturday while with your kids?).  Ordered some breakfast tacos and a hot tea. Good potato egg and cheese tacos, wish I had gotten an extra red salsa.  Also I was impressed at their loose leaf tea selection, all Zhi Tea. I will go back for that alone.  Seemed to be folks working/studying in the coffee shop side, nothing fancy, but adequate facility. Staff was friendly and efficient. The lounge side would be a cool place to see a show, good space, probably seats 50-75.  Check it out if South Austin or Sunset Valley is your 'hood.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee Strange Brew  has all the elements I love in a coffee shop: Ample parking and seating Free Wi-Fi Locally made Rock Star bagels Topo Chico Cold brewed Ice Coffee Beer and wine Happy Hour Open 24 X 7  This is further south than I typically venture for coffee but after a drop off at the airport and in route to work, Ice coffee and a bagel was the perfect way to start out an early Monday morning. The service was quick and I was pleased to find they cold brew their ice coffee which = less bitter. In addition to Rock Star Bagels they also sell other locally made food from Quacks Bakery, Torchy's Tacos and Full English Bakery. They accept the Go Local card and have happy hour Monday-Friday from 5pm-7pm. Beer!",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I love Strange Brew. It's bare-bones approach to a coffee house is strangely comforting. I'm here today to get some work done. I'm set up with my laptop at one of their many tables, soy latte in hand. Haven't been able to get that freshly-baked bagel-wrapped sausage off my mind since I spotted it the moment I walked in. Trying. Not. To. Give. In. I probably will though, in about a half hour, so I can at least feel some sort of dietary accomplishment. All in all, cool strange vibe, definitely lives up to our town's ""Keep Austin Weird"" mantra. I think they have some sort of live music here in the evenings, which is a nice touch.",1
Coffee Shop 61,I want love this place even though there chai tea left something to be desired now they just got too big for their britches and I won't be going back even though they have some amazing artist that I was performed there,0
Coffee Shop 61,Very cool unassuming place.  Tucked away but really hip!,1
Coffee Shop 61,"Coffee is good. Ambiance is great. And there's tons of space for one to relax and do whatnot. I was recommended a chocolate chip cookie but it wasn't very good; not soft at all. Their other pastries look amazing tho. I'll try more in the future. Oh, and the staff is friendly and funny. One of my favorite coffee houses.",1
Coffee Shop 61,I spent several hours at strange brew writing on my laptop and reading. This is very much my style of coffee place where I don't feel rushed. They were busy but not overwhelmed on a rainy day and I'd hang out here anytime. Reminds of college and spending time in coffee shops.  All I had was warm green tea during my visit but I'll be happy to try other options and grab a cappuccino next time I'm in.,1
Coffee Shop 61,"Great service, good coffee all in a wonderfully Austin-esque venue. Strange Brew is the Spiderhouse of South Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Great vibe, great music, great patio, GREAT COFFEE. After the recent renovations, the amount of space allows this coffee joint to be anything you want it to be.  Music venue? Study room? Outdoor patio? Coffee date? Grab a drink with a friend? They've got ya covered.  Make sure to grab a vegan oatmeal raisin cookie and a strange brew on ice. Forever in love.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"South Austin enterprise on Manchaca Road just North of Stassney offers: coffee shop with sandwich menu, quiet rooms for work/study, internet access, patio area out back, shaded porch in front, free parking and - the icing on the cake - one of the best live music rooms in Austin, Texas.  I have been going here since the place opened. The owner is totally dedicated to the live music and it shows. Here is a breakdown of what I like about Strange Brew.    LIVE MUSIC ROOM:  The sound system is outstanding. Strange Brew's music venue is called Lounge Side and has won five awards from SXSW over the past two years. The ""door"" fees begin at free for some musicians then rise to $6.00 and up.  You can find out who is playing on their web site and can purchase tickets in advance.  Music starts early and we often take in the 4 PM or 6 PM shows. The audience is respectful and quiet is appreciated. The place has a neighborhood hangout feel and many in the audience seem to know each other and the musicians well. Hospitality toward new customers is very good. There is a wine and beer bar and table service. I really like that you can have coffee in the music room and can also order grilled sandwiches and other food either from the barkeeper or direct from the barista at the coffee counter just outside the door. The staff books a wide range of musicians - mostly Americana, but also jazz, blues, C&W, folk and some creative genres as well. Joe Ely, Malford Milligan, Jeff Plankenhorn, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Justin Welch, Emily Gimble, Ernie Durawa and many other well-known Texas musicians - some who play on the road as far away as Europe - may be enjoyed here. There are frequent guest musician appearances and I think that some new material is tried out in this room.  FOOD AND COFFEE: The barista and ordering stand is just inside the main door. This is not a fancy place and has a limited, but adequate menu. There are cold drinks in the cooler. Iced tea is provided. Coffee purchases come with a free refill. I am a black coffee drinker and enjoy their brews, but can't comment on their lattes and other coffee drinks. The grilled cheese sandwich is very tasty. The Rueben is one of the best in town. There are pastries including muffins and banana nut breads. Prices are fair compared to other establishments. The wine bar in the music room has a small selection of beers and wines.  QUIET AND WORKSPACE:  There are several rooms with good seating for those who ant to be alone with their coffee and computer.  Being close to Austin Community College brings a steady flow of customers who make this a study hall away from home. Guidelines for purchases to support the free Wi-Fi and seating space seem fair to me.  PATIO and PORCH:  I thoroughly enjoy sitting in a chair out on the front porch with coffee and a snack and listening to music in the background. Very relaxing on a warm evening. Good place to meet friends.  So, if you are from out of town and you want an Austin neighborhood experience, this is a good place to try.  If you live 15 minutes away as I do, then this is a place you can go and enjoy on a whim.  LATE REPORT - Just got back from an enjoyable two hours at Strange Brew Lounge Side. Durawa with Ernie Durawa on drums, Chris Alcarez on bass and Will Knaack on lead guitar plus guest on keyboards and organ - Mark Goodwin - put on a blast of a show - just superior bluesy jazzy music and vocals plus high energy antics on stage. Had a Malbec and a coffee. Great night!! Again!! I interacted with 4 employees and 3 musicians and all were hospitable and pleasant to me. The small wine and beer bar at Lounge Side. Table service is also provided. Memory of the early days when the place opened. Love settin' out on that covered front porch. See all photos from Stephen S. for Strange Brew, Austin Coffee",1
Coffee Shop 61,"I used to love this place. Love it! It was a great neighborhood coffee shop. I used to be comfortable taking my kiddo here to have a cup of jo and a cookie.  Now, it's expanded. It's got some weirdo clientele. Is it a bar, music venue or coffee shop? I don't know!  Horrible internet rules.  No longer family friendly (the employees are nice, the vibe, not so much).  Crappy food.  Good coffee.  Word on the street is they bought the Bakehouse. I hope they don't do the same carb heavy, pre-made food as they do in Strange Brew, because they neighborhood needs a nice restaurant that serves up some healthy food.  Anyway, now that Radio has opened up down the street, I'll likely be moving my business there. Sorry Strange Brew! I used to love you. Maybe you'll come around and be the neighborhood awesomesauce place again. I sure hope so.",0
Coffee Shop 61,"2 check-ins The Strange Brew Lounge has some of the best acoustics in the city and it is known as one of the best listening rooms in Austin. Get there about a half hour before the show & you're assured a good seat. The coffee is good, and they also service a variety of other beverages including italian sodas, chai teas, beer, and more.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Great coffee, great music, great staff.  Not some stuffy uptight coffeehouse that makes you feel out of place if you aren't a coffee aficionado or somehow not hipster enough. Great place for studying, catching up with an old friend or making a new buddy while taking in a live show on the lounge side. Would you like a cold beer or a hot cup of coffee?",1
Coffee Shop 61,"Listed in I enjoy beverages I wasn't really sure what to expect coming by here, and I'm kind of still surprised that a place like this exists in Austin. I'll just list all the good things this time, because I'm sure you can come to the same conclusion of AWESOME.  - Open 24/7 - Free Wifi - Extensive selection of drinks (coffee, beer, wine) - Very roomy - live music - PARKING!  There's nothing wrong with this picture and I hope this place sticks around for a good long while! If it was closer to my house, I'd be here way too much.",1
Coffee Shop 61,"2 check-ins The best beer selection of any coffee shop in Austin.  But Jesus Christ... Has anyone actually been able to get online here?  I have come here to work four or five times. I think I could actually get online ONE of those times. And of course I had already made my purchase the other times, so I had to just sit there and stare at the wall until I finished my drink before going somewhere else to try to catch up on the lost time.",0
Coffee Shop 53,"I found Quack's Bakery in Hyde Park when I stayed for a few days at the lovely ""Cottage at Duval Garden Airbnb"" on Duval St.   Quacks offers pastries, croissants, muffins, cookies, pies, cakes and cupcakes - all freshly baked everyday on the premises.  They also offer a variety of juices and coffee or tea.    It's a charming neighborhood bakery with a lot of locals and students that meet there to relax and chat in a comfy laid back atmosphere.  The yummy, freshly homebaked quality is exactly what I miss so much since Starbucks took over the coffee scene.  I also found myself loading up on apple danish, peach muffins and banana nut bread to take with me and snack on later.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Quack's is a great stop and go place where you can pick up a sweet treat and be on your way. The interior of this place isn't that conducive to studying due to the lack of tables and outlets. Half of the space is dedicated to the bakery display, with the other half devoted to a sitting area. In addition, I think their drinks are pretty average, so stick to the baked goods.  Other than that, I think Quack's has excellent cookies and cupcakes, and they always have really adorably decorated sugar cookies (got a ghost for Halloween) that make for a great gift. Service can be hit or miss, but Quack's definitely has that Austin vibe going for it and has its own particular charm.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This place is damn charming. When I was younger I had no idea it was around the corner. Probably good for my little fatso self to be honest.  Could not help myself and bought a few pastries as well as a cookie. The cookies are cute and taste good but the sugary coating gets a little dry. The shortbread underneath is still good and hey, it's fun eating a mummy's face!  The jalapeño cheese croissant is so good. I could have those everyday.  The drip is not half bad either. Room in here for probably 20-25 people to sit around. It's a nice open spot in quiet Hyde Park. More fun cookies for fall Vegan but looks delish cupcakes Fun cookies See all photos from Mary P. for Quack's 43rd Street Bakery",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Quack's is a quirky little place in Hyde Park... cute for it's no frills ambience.  A friend recommended the place for their pie.  We ordered a whole strawberry rhubarb pie and as a lover of strawberry rhubarb pie, I would say it was above average in taste and a wee bit expensive ($25).  The filling was good but I could use more strawberries, and a little more tart.  The crust was average, a little tasteless to be honest.  I also had the peanut butter, snickerdoodle, and chocolate chip cookies and they were nothing amazing.  Carrot cake was also just okay.  Standout of the night was their key lime tart!  Graham cracker crust was great, filling was tart... loved it.  I'll probably be back to give some of their other selections a try... and for the key lime tart! Key lime tart, carrot cake, and strawberry tea cookies",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This place is a pretty decent option for cakes and desserts! The cookies and cream torte is absolutely delicious! I've also tried the peanut butter chocolate cupcakes, triple chocolate cake and the cookies and cream cupcakes and recommend them! This place wouldn't be my first pick for dessert but is good regardless!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"The displays were so dirty and the cookies were so dry - I threw mine out, which is unfortunate because they were a gift. I was too embarrassed to give them. This place seems to have a lot of fans, so maybe I came on an off-day. Wouldn't go there again myself but I would be willing to try them again if a friend wanted to stop by!",0
Coffee Shop 53,"We came in to check out their pastries and they have some really cute cookie designs! I had a carrot cupcake and my friend got the chocolate peanut butter cupcake. They were both delicious! The carrot cupcake had seeds and a really nice texture, probably my favorite carrot anything ever. The chocolate cupcake meanwhile was tasty and moist, the top was both chocolate and peanut butter and while it was a little too much for me, was the perfect amount for my friend. This business also has sandwiches, coffee, and pies (to order), as well as photographs hung up for sale. The two people who helped us out were really friendly and made funny conversation so that was really nice and welcoming! If I'm ever back in Austin I'll make sure to drop by again. My carrot cupcake!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"38 check-ins This local bakery has been a staple in Hyde Park for decades. There is usually a line to the door and it is always worth the wait. I knocked it down a star for service. I wish the staff would just be a little more ""with it"". Maybe they are so high off of all the sugar they crash and burn at the service counter?!!  Favorites- chocolate ginger cookie, salty oat, snickerdoodle, ok all their cookies! Regular rotation of fun design on sugar cookies. Chocolate ganache cake, walnut scone, carrot cake. Barristas make a mean latte!  Sometimes lacking- needs more blueberries in the muffin, scones are sometimes a little on the dry side.  Tips- get there right after 6pm for discounted daily breakfast items. Any shortbread cookie can be designed just for you if you place an order of 12 or more. I ordered champagne flutes, bottles and ""40 and fabulous"" cookies for a friend's birthday and they turned out, well, fabulous!  Thanks Quack's for always been there! Made to order shortbread cookies",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Very cool place. Sadly, I think I had it bookmarked for 3 years now lol  Anyway, Quack's is located in the very charming Hyde Park neighborhood with lots of other great local shops around. It was quite busy for a Saturday morning, as you can imagine, and I was overwhelmed by all the options. They seem to have everything here, and is heaven for a sugar addict.  I opted for the pumpkin bread (because I love pumpkin everything) and an iced coffee with almond milk in it. Both were too sweet for me but I'm not knocking the place...it IS a place for sweets ;)  I really wish I would have tried the salted oak or the nutella tea cookies which were mentioned in others reviews. Also, the cupcakes looked enticing...and the cookies a work of art although many of the reviews say they are just for looks. Oh well, next time ;)",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Updated reviewThe chocolate cream pie is rumored to ""make you wanna slap yo mama."" Yup, it's that good. I always love seeing the decorated cookies and the old school feel is always welcoming. The employees haven't been as upbeat as normal, so that was a little disappointing but maybe they'll perk up with the fall weather coming! Good job quacks, I will be back! Chocolate cream pie. My friend says it ""makes you wanna slap yo mama""",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Dude. If you are craving some bakery goods, this place is the place to come!  With a decorative outside with a big white duck and big words ""Quack's 43rd Street Bakery"", you will have a great experience with their various baked pastries. From bread, cookies, muffins, cupcakes and drinks, they offer such a wide variety that suits all tastes and flavors!  When my parents came up a couple of weeks ago, we visited here and got these items: Oatmeal Creme Pie, Blueberry Muffin and Lemon Pound Cake All of these are delicious! The Oatmeal Creme Pie is humongous and has the right proportion of cream to cookie. The Blueberry Muffin is fall apart in your mouth, the perfect sweetness and lots of blueberries. The Lemon Pound Cake reminded me of Starbucks' Lemon Cake but like 10 times better!  Great atmosphere to sit and have a chat, to study, or to enjoy good company! Come now!",1
Coffee Shop 53,9 check-ins I love quacks! Great baked goods and super cute coffee place. It's the perfect weekend spot to work or read See all photos from Julia L. for Quack's 43rd Street Bakery,1
Coffee Shop 53,A very clean and quiet place with good coffee but even better pastries and deserts! I got the magic almond bar this time which was heavenly and last time I tried the carrot cake which was good too. There's ample parking (parking lot on the side) and a good number of tables and chairs. The music is quiet enough and people keep pretty quiet so it's good for studying,1
Coffee Shop 53,"I love me some Quack's. At work we place large cupcake orders all the time for clients and Julia always kicks major ass at responding to my emails and makes sure they're perfect before I pick them up. Quack's is perfect for business and pleasure, if you will. They're great at taking business orders and awesome at walk up service too.  Everyone I have encountered there has been a pleasure ordering from and talking to. May I recommend their SNICKERDOODLE COOKIES. That had to be all caps because they're the best snickerdoodles I have ever had. Sorry, Tiff's - Quack's proves you can have delicious snickerdoodle cookies, the size of your face without having to be gooey and fresh from the oven. So if you're reading this, future boyfriend/husband, the way to my heart is Quack's snickerdoodles. Other delicacies I have enjoyed are the Fricano sandwiches that they toast to perfection and their croissants (that WILL sell out in the morning). I'll be sad the day I leave Hyde Park and Quack's isn't a drive or walk away!",1
Coffee Shop 53,Donovan the barista was the first one to appreciate the way I drink my coffee. It was not a posh place like some places in the center of the city and the place a bit run down but they sure try to make you happy Nothing fancy but nice people,1
Coffee Shop 53,"If you subscribe to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" mantra, then Quack's is the bakery for you.  I sometimes have a hard time finding the ""weird"" in Austin, a city that is trying hard to hold onto its roots while embracing its celebrity status in the hipster world.  But Quack's is a holdover from a time when the eclectic defined this outpost in the Lone Star State.  Quack's main draw has to be the sweets and Quack's has plenty of them. Whether your sweet tooth craves cookies or cupcakes or pies or cakes, you're sure to find something to bring a smile to your face. The hardest decision you may have to make is what to eat at one of the tables frequented by the locals.  If you're smart, you'll do what I do, get a slice of key lime tart to enjoy I house with a cuppa Joe any a bag of cookies and cupcakes to take home with you. You can never have too many sweets. Corn on the cob cookies. Texas cookies. Key lime tart. See all photos from David B. for Quack's 43rd Street Bakery",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Based on the two pastries I chose for the morning, I would say this place is decent. Maybe I ordered the wrong items though. The iced cinnamon roll had no flavor and a weird texture. There wasn't any cinnamon flavoring to the inside of the roll which was wet and soggy with the icing. The icing itself was too sweet and not creamcheesy at all - just sugar icing. I ate a couple bites and left it. I also tried the bran blueberry muffin which was surprisingly sweet as well. Not healthy or lightly sweetened by bananas but possibly too much brown sugar. They use those little freeze dried blueberries too I think (they were tiny). Definitely pretty disappointed with my breakfast but I'm sure their pies and cookies are delicious.",0
Coffee Shop 53,"They serve sandwiches from Fricano's, and I got the Turkey Special. Quack's serves them with a pickle (optional) and with a bag of chips (get the sweet potato ones if you're into sweet potato). Got a 20 oz iced caramel latte with it and everything came out to a little over $11. Which I am totally OK with since the sandwich was packed with ingredients and got a medium coffee.  Service was great, superb even. The manager started to take my order, but seemed distracted and politely asked another employee to help me since he couldn't focus on me (due to another issue he had to deal with that the new person serving me relayed to me).  Everyone that works here seems to be so genuinely nice and it really ups the atmosphere. Plenty of outlets, plenty of tables for such a small space, and the big windows make it a great place to study or work at during the day. Lots of natural lighting. Wi-fi errs on the faster side compared to all the coffeeshops/cafes I've been to.  They have a huge selection of desserts: pies, cookies, croissants, cakes, cupcakes. You name it, they probably got it.  Can't tell if it's in a neighborhood or on the edge of one; either way, the location makes it feel, for lack of a better word, homey...or I guess, neighborly? I can't see how anyone could have a problem with this place, but then again, everyone has different experiences. Maybe I got lucky with a having a great one here.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Delicious pastries in a nice hipster setting. If you have had any deserts at any of the coffee houses around Austin then you've probably have already had some of their pastries. They make a great variety of deserts, mostly in the form of sweets and carbs. Their carrot cakes are super moist and the cream cheese frosting is smooth.  The raisins oatmeal cookies with sea salt sprinkled on top is also a good option. They also make theme sugar frosting cookies that are cute. Peanut butter fudge and strawberry rhubarb pie Summer picnic themed sugar frosting cookies!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"5 check-ins This is my go to place in Austin for desserts. I'm a big fan of their nutella tea cookies, and my honey loves their cherry pie. They have a large assortment of traditional cookies, cakes and pies, so this place can easily fulfill every sweet tooth.  Great place to study, hang out or just grab your favorite thing.  For real, though: Get the nutella tea cookies! Too good!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Updated review Still awesome after all these years. I've been going to Quack's for over a decade: for coffee while studying, for after hours work stuff, and to read on the weekend. Almost every one of my birthdays in Austin has featured cupcakes from Quack's, and we even got our wedding cake here (Italian creme for the win!). This past week, we celebrated our daughter's half birthday with their cupcakes, too. We love you, Quack's! xoxox",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I visited this evening with my daughter and husband to try out their pastries and espresso drinks, but was disappointed by the whole experience. There was no one ordering ahead of us, so I'm not sure why it took them over 10 minutes to acknowledge our presence. Then the guy ringing us up never spoke or made eye contact, and just seemed generally annoyed. My mocha was ok, but they forgot to use soy milk (that I asked for twice) and the eclair and pie tasted stale. But what bothered me more than anything was that I felt the staff were rude and condescending.. I don't see myself going back anytime soon.",0
Coffee Shop 53,"Love this place! The pastry selection is so vast there is something to please everyone. My favorites are the pumpkin bread and the cookies that they sprinkle with sea salt. Also, the employees are so sweet and will even hold your dog for you outside while you wait in line!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Updated review 21 check-ins Listed in Cutest Cafes in Austin I really want to give Quack's 5 stars, but it's not quite there.  That being said, I have had many more positive experiences lately at Quack's - the service has definitely been more positive - they make an effort to ask how I'm doing and whatnot, and the place has in general been a lot cleaner.  I will say that I always receive a warm latte, which quickly cools down - kind of disappointing. I wish they would make them a little bit hotter!  Quack's is still probably #1 for pastries in the neighborhood, but in terms of coffee & interior, it's lacking.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"My wife and I started a tradition on our honeymoon of buying cookies at local bakeries and bringing them back to the hotel room to have dessert for later in the evening. We landed late in Austin and after grabbing dinner and checking out Formula 1's downtown FanFest -- it was after 10. Most bakeries are closed at that time. Luckily for us, Quack's was open!  The service was great. Very patient with us as we scanned each display case for which treat we wanted. We finally went with a chocolate caramel brownie (delicious), pumpkin sugar cookie (really good), salty oats cookie (my wife was obsessed) and they gave us a free chocolate cat cookie (my wife was also obsessed).  Overall, we enjoyed the treats, the service was great and we were happy with the late hours.  Check them out! Display case! Featuring their horrifying cookies!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Gosh I was really hoping their stuff would be good since my wife and I had been searching for a cute date spot to get goodies every now and then. The ambience is pretty cute and the location is in a spunky part of town but the baked goods were just not that yummy. The lighting out side is terrible so it is hard to find this place at night. As for the baked goods ..... where should I start? Well we got a nutella cookie, boston cream cupcake, and a chocolate cream pie. The nutella cookie was super dry and the ""nutella"" part of it is just a glob of nutella sitting on top. The boston cream cupcake was dry and a bit under-sweetened, it almost tasted like a muffin. The worst of them all was the chocolate cream pie which we ended up throwing away after a handful of bites. Every bite had egg shells in the crust. - Every. single. bite.! I just cannot stand biting into a moist pie crust(expecting a little bit of heaven to tickle my tastebuds) and then getting pieces of eggshell instead of a smooth finish!! It's like going to an oyster bar and getting sand/shell/etc in every oyster. The shuckers are supposed to be pros so that should never happen right? I guess I will never be able to forget the experience I had with the pie .. I do not know if I will be going back but I really hope I could brave the eggshells sooner than later to give these guys another try. If it weren't for the cute ambience and funky part of town they are in, I would have given them a 1-star rating.  Minimal parking so be ready to wander around to find parking on busy days. See all photos from Jennifer Y. for Quack's 43rd Street Bakery",0
Coffee Shop 53,"If you like thick crust pie (cause you know its the best part!), then this is your sweet shop of choice. The pie crust here is so thick, you'll need a pretty sharp knife to cut through the confectionaries and they are mind bogglingly good.  I highly recommend the key lime pie. Tart, sweet fresh bursting lime flavor in a gelled custard with thick crust. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm  I tried some apple pie too but it sadly wasn't that great. A bit too mushy. But hey, find a pie you like and have at it. No regrets for the weight you gain.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"The cupcakes here are amazing! I've had their normal sized cupcakes and their mini cupcakes, both are amazing, but I like to get a mini cupcake or two, or a mini cupcake with a sugar cookie to have one for later. The designs for the sugar cookies are always unique and fun! Their coffee also delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Listed in Kaffe I have been trying cafes around Austin for two months now, and Quack's is by far my favorite.  Ambiance-wise, if I had to put words to the interior I'd have to go with Grungespresso -- in an endearing way -- and the quality of their espresso beats most other shops by miles.  It was also here that my best friend was coerced, begrudgingly, to enter a coffee shop for the first time (he isn't keen on the bean) and it's also where he discovered a deep love for their baked goods.  According to him, the cherry danish is better than the other pastries he's sampled as I have dragged him along on my journey across the espresso river of Austin.  He also now looks forward to visiting new cafes, but he agrees that Quack's is still his favorite.  Most importantly, have you seen their logo?  It's a space duck.  Forget about their smooth espresso; pay no mind to their buttery, flaky pastries; even their extremely kind and patient baristas that always have neato hair and answer any questions without an air...  Okay, don't forget about all of that but still, space duck.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Wanted to say a big thank you to Quack's for making delicious and very pretty pink cupcakes for my friend's baby shower today.  I ordered the cakes in advance, and it was very easy to deal with the friendly cake guy (sorrry, I forgot your name!) We loved the variety of flavors, I insist the carrot with your oh-so-scrumptious buttery icing is the best cupcake in the world. Everyone loved them!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This is my first time coming to the bakery! Wow! Where has this been my whole life!  I love their croissants and how MANY pastries and treats they have in their cases. Very cool to see a store with so much variety! They also have sandwiches and so many coffee and tea selections. It was almost overwhelming how many options they have!  I ordered the asiago croissant and an iced latte. Not the best latte in the world, but damn good and that croissant was the perfect small lunch!  Overall I will be back here again and again! Trying all that they have to offer! What a fun bakery and the staff was very kind and helpful!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Got a peach cobbler muffin and was good but wasn't as peachy as I had hoped. A little skimpy on the peach cobbler part. Batter was good, almond flavor which was pleasantly unexpected.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Yesterday was our first visit to Quack's. Since there are not many bakeries in Austin, we are always on the look out for ANY bakery, let alone a good one. Several people had recommended this place and I really wanted to like it.... I was hoping that it was better than Bribery Bakery in Wells Branch, which we find to be just so-so.  My only positive is that I like the Hyde Park neighborhood that it is located in.  When I walked in the store and was waiting in line, I noticed the ceiling. It was disgustingly dirty. The whole place felt like it needed hosed down. As I looked into the glass cases, several things looked good. Several things were rather odd for what I normally see in a bakery. So many Vegan selections was a little off putting. Then, I saw a fly buzzing around the cookies in the case.  I was willing to overlook all of that if the pastries actually tasted good. But.... We bought 3 things: blueberry Danish, strawberry thumb print type of cookies, and peanut butter cookies. It all cost about $20. We brought them home and tried everything for breakfast this morning.  Everything tasted odd. I have never been to a bakery in my life where the items tasted so off. There is something about the dough or the butter or whatever ingredients they are using. Perhaps it just doesn't have enough sugar. Or maybe there is no sugar. The taste of the Strawberry cookies was a lot like strawberry and Crisco that left a bad aftertaste in your mouth. And it was kind of dry. The peanut butter cookies tasted like sand, were very very dry, and they had that same weird after taste. Could it be the butter they use? It makes me wonder if they know what they are doing when they are baking. Also it worries me that they are using some ingredient that I may be allergic to. And I am allergic to certain artificial sweeteners.  I just don't trust their goods now and won't be back. We live in Pflugerville, so this place is not convenient for us. But, I would have been a regular and willing to drive all the way to it if the place wasn't so grungy and the food actually tasted good.  I'm so disappointed.",0
Coffee Shop 53,"I'd come back. Love the atmosphere, and the neighborhood, service was friendly, professional, and on point. I ordered the peanut butter fudge cake for our anniversary. Good quality, but heavy on the rich, rich peanut butter, and lacking on he fudge. I'd come back in an instant, but will try another cake next time. Peanut butter fudge cake. Good quality, but heavy on the rich, rich peanut butter. I wanted more fudge frosting!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"2 check-ins The quintessential stomping grounds of Hyde Park residents when they need a place to enjoy a cup of coffee, dessert, enjoy home away from home or just to get some work, reading or socializing done.    I personally love the consistently unique designs of their cookies!! There's always a new design to represent a holiday.  For April Fool's they had designed a cup cake to look like mash potatoes (see my picture of this foolish delight!) I personally love their lattes and the staff is friendly.    Tables are a bit small but large enough to place your lap top and still have some room for your coffee.  It can get fairly busy so there are times when you might not find a table available inside.  However, there is seating outside and normally tables are available.  If you plan to have a group meeting and have multiple laptops open you may have some limited space issues.  Aside from that Quack's is a great place to relax, unwind, work and take on the Austin coffee shop scenery! April fool's cupcake!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I've visited Quack's before, but I hadn't written a review on it until now.  This Austin staple was a great place to visit for a late night dessert and non-alcoholic drink. I got a lovely Nutella cookie and an Irish soda. The soda wasn't very sweet but that was my fault. I know I could have asked for it to be sweeter (not that I needed the sugar anyway. Haha!)  They had a lot of fun desserts that looked tasty which I would love to go back and try in the future. The prices were good too in my opinion--always a fan of that!  It was a little cramped (parking, sitting, etc.) but hey, it's Austin, and I'd rather have fun and quirky than another parking garage. All in all, it was fun hanging out in the Hyde Park neighborhood area.  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend Quack's 43rd Street Bakery. Go check it out!!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"3 check-ins I love me some quacks. No trip to Austin is complete without a stop here.  My absolute favorite is the coconut cream pie. Its got huge shreds of coconut and topped with a heaping serving of whipped cream.  The coconut cream also has a nice light flavor. Its not very heavy like most cream pies.  The cupcakes are hit or miss, I've had moist ones, and some are probably not as fresh.  The snickerdoodle cookie was pretty good.  Loosing one star because on my last visit there was a fly in the cookie case, and they didn't do much to remove it after I informed them of the intruder. Delicious treats",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I love Quack's! I used to live in Austin and any time I come back, I have to get Quack's!  The customer service is always the same, which is to say it's great! It's instantly like being at home.  The key lime pie. This pie here.. Oh my goodness! It's so succulent. It's the perfect balance of sweet, tart and crust. The crust! It actually holds the pie together and it's just as delicious as the filling. I have to take an entire pie with me anytime I go. I pack a cooler just to bring back Quack's key lime pie!  Austin is a terrific city and I would recommend any one move here if to do nothing but eat Quack's everyday.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This is one bakery that is away from the downtown area. In the middle of mostly residential.  We called to see if German Chocolate cake was available for the afternoon on the way into town about three hours out. We were going to surprise our friend with an early birthday cake. They didn't have any but provided they were able to get one made. Order was taken with payment over the phone.  We arrived and cake was ready with the surprise note. We took the cake to which we tried hours later.  German chocolate was perhaps one of the best if not the absolute best. My friend loved the freshly made cake. Healthy rich chocolate, hearty amount of nuts and coconut. We all thought the cake was well crafted.  We saved some for later because well there was only five of us eating a eight person cake. The cake was not nearly enjoyable. Definitely aged to be more rich. Still good just way much sugar.  Good: freshly made cake and quick service. Bad: wish the cake held better for an extra day.  The service and fresh cakes speak for themselves. I would visit again for other items on the menu. Store Front Another view of the German Chocolate German Chocolate",1
Coffee Shop 53,"4 check-ins The perfect storm of obsession and pre-obesity, Quacks is doing it right for four reasons:  1. Some of the best (if not THE best) cakes, pastries, cookies in town (seriously, try their chocolate devil's food and tell me you disagree) 2. Legit great coffee .... not always found at bakeries, but found here 3. Friendly, helpful staff .... don't know what to get? they'll help you! 4. Cute, comfy space if you need to hang around for a while  To top all of this off, the prices are great and they're open late!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Updated review OMG- I came here before my starting my new diet plan and got the salty oat cookie, chocolate cookie and a few Halloween cookies. Perhaps my favorite cookie in life. It's even up there with my fave cookie from Levain in NYC. OMG. I want these cookies at my wedding but I'm getting married in Louisiana so that might not be feasible but seriously. Best cookies ever.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I really enjoy this neighborhood bakery. It's totally got a bit of that hipster feel, but don't let that scare you away. The first time I was here, I did have a couple slices of pie (key lime and strawberry rhubarb) and I was initially disappointed. It was kept too cold and the pie crust was tough to break and wasn't great. I decided to come back again and the pies were much better. No problems with the crust. I think I might have just been an off day, or the pies just came right out into the display and didn't have enough time to come to room temp. Their pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats have always been delicious, and they have the prettiest cookies. Their coffee is good too.  This is a nice little neighborhood bakery to get your morning or afternoon pick-me-up! Love it!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I got the 16 oz 43rd Street coffee and felt it was a fair price for a decent-tasting coffee.  They have an assortment of baked goods (pause for gasps) and the prices on them seemed about normal and the quality looked good enough.  I felt the tables were a bit too close together, so the wife and I spoke in near whispers as to not disturb the other tables.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Everything I've had is always great and the coffee is nice and rich.  Great pie crusts, buttercream cake frosting, and tasty almond bars: there's something for everyone here. 2 for 1 morning pastries after 6:30 and super duper nice staff.  I've done some work here a couple times and the wifi is good. Seating is typically small tables, so I'm usually here just for the treats.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Great bakery - cupcakes & pies oh my! Got the latte it was delicious. The family loaded up on desserts, peanut butter cupcake, lemon cupcake, mint truffles, and strawberry rhubarb pie.  Thumbs up for all!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I love the oversized cupcakes they make and sell here! They're always so fresh and are never dry and crumbly. The icing on them is quality stuff too - not that scary kind made from a million weird chemicals you can't pronounce.  The guys at the counter are always so friendly and on top of the game service wise. The atmosphere is along the lines of a casual deli. No booths but plenty of wooden tables and chairs. I always see students working away at their laptops here, it's a pretty laid back place.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Quack's has the best cookies in the world: Czech tea cookies and nutella filled tea cookies.  I used to live super close and I came by quite often, after I moved to what feels like Southern Round Rock I would drive 30min down here just to get a bunch of cookies and eat them all in one sitting whenever I have a rainy day.  For Halloween they are making green witch finger cookies instead of the Czech tea cookies, they taste the same but you have to be into the funky look they have! Witch fingers",1
Coffee Shop 53,"2 check-ins Every time I go to Quack's, I'm instantly hit with a wave of sweet, delicious smells, friendly service, and inspiration. Not only do they offer delectable pies with perfectly buttery crusts, intricately decorated sugar cookies, and tasty muffins galore, they also have sandwiches, coffee, and beautifully crafted cakes.  The adorable bakery is a great place to study, catch up, or just to grab a quick bite. I love their muffins and their stuffed breakfast croissants. And I'll always look for any excuse to buy a pie to take home.  You really can't go wrong with any choice you make here. Whether it's breakfast or dessert, Quack's seems to have all bases covered.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"While I had been promised negative customer service by almost everyone I know, my experience was (surprisingly?) pleasant). Hellos, pleases, thank yous, how was your days, all the pleasant chit chat. I guess the Quack's staff beat the rumored Grouchiness that day?  Anyway, while everyone had warned me of uncaring staff, they still recomended it for the food, and so I went. Everything I sampled was delicious - I'd rank their stawberry-champagne macaron pretty highly. Delicious buttery/creamy cupcake frosting, so much more cookie per dollar than the traditional Tiff's Treats, and a delightful array of teas.  Update: I have returned, and everyone was once again exceedingly pleasabt. Wonderful Sunday morning breakfast place!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Love this place!  As is usual when a place does something very well the line can sometimes get long but the wait is worth it! The staff here are quite nice and friendly. My husband and I come pretty regular for coffee dates before his classes and I like to come on the weekend and sew.  They make a fantastic Cortado, trust me and order one! I love too many food things here to count but my top favs are the lemon poppy seed loaf, the gingerbread cake, the chocolate raspberry cupcake and the ever lovely strawberry tea cookies. *sigh* Ok. So my favorite-favorite is the lemon poppy seed loaf, they put in almond extract so it's got all my favorite flavors.  For those who wonder there is free Wifi, and the restrooms are always clean.  *You bus your own table here, the bins for plates and cups are by the restroom!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Listed in My C8H10N4O2 Fix Awesome bakery!! Usually not a big fan of tomatoes, but whatever they did with the croissants and tomatoes was freaking delicious. Also their gigantic oatmeal cream pie is pretty cool too! MAJOR TIP: a lot of their pastries are buy one get one free after 6:30. The line got REALLY long around then as hordes of people came in. The oatmeal cream pie!!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"9 check-ins If you ask anyone I hang out with, they may tell you I'm a tiny bit obsessed with this place.  I am.    As a previous pastry slave myself, I have nothing but respect and admiration for what these guys do.  And I find myself here nearly weekly.  Quacks has a great selection of pastries: pies (sliced and whole), cookies, cupcakes (vegan too!), breakfast pastries, cakes.  Each is beautifully decorated, with obvious care and consideration (really, the cookies are gorgeous).  Someone back there enjoys what they do.  I've sampled the cupcakes and pies so far (more than I care to admit).  Cupcakes are huge, and topped with a generous topping of perfect buttercream (seriously, it's the optimal 90% butter).  The pies is where they get me though.  Pies are tough!!  You have to master the filling AND the crust to excel - and these guys #nailedit.  The filling is consistently on point across pie types - blueberry, peach, apple, cherry - they've got it.  And their crusts!?!  Butter.  Not under-baked like the usual places - but golden and buttery.  I'm the girl that usually scoops out the filling and attacks the crust - I won't do it here - I'll inhale it all.  The service is consistently friendly (with the exception of some girl last night) and thoughtful.  The place is usually bustling but never busy enough to sacrifice service.  They have a good amount of both indoor and outdoor seating so you can stay awhile - unless you want to scarf your treat on your way home in your car (I won't judge).    Quacks surpasses any other Austin bakery I have yet to try - stop by, grab a chocolate cupcake or a slice of pie and enjoy the neighborhood ambiance.    *There is also a kickbutt cheeseshop a few doors down. Best shortbread cookies.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I'm updating my review to 5 stars because the manager fixed the waste water problem. Responsive and caring- so appreciated.  Excellent value; love his place and am in there every day.  I do wish they'd do something about speeding up the standing in line thing which can be soooo tedious here, but what the heck - on balance this place is great, and VALUE is practically unheard of in Austin restaurants, so THANK YOU, QUACK'S!  Super nice staff always.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"2 check-ins I finally found a place where the pastries are the perfect sweetness for me. I can count on Quack's for a cupcake that won't leave me worrying about getting diabetes.  Since their cupcakes change daily, I don't know half the time what I'm getting. But the cupcakes always turn out to be delicious, and I especially like their cupcake icing. I once got a mint chocolate cupcake expecting the icing to be sweet. However when I bit into it I was amazed by how delicious it was and how it wasn't...sweet. I think I gobbled that thing down in one bite...kind of like how Patrick did with his chocolate bar in Spongebob, and then blamed Spongebob for eating his chocolate bar since he didn't remember eating his.  I do frequently come here, especially after eating at nearby restaurants like Hyde Park Bar & Grill. A few times though Quacks ran out of pretty much everything! Well who could blame them when you have loyal customers who spend hours inside the bakery, and eating everything that touches the display cases.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This place is unreal! My husband and I have come in several times to indulge in the awesome pies. When I found out that we were expecting a baby girl, I went in looking for some type of pink dessert that I could surprise him with. When they didn't have anything available, I asked the guy at the register if they had anything pink in the back (I told him what it was for) and he told me to wait just a moment. He came back and said that they did not, but instead he went in the back and got a fresh cupcake and they topped it with pink icing just for me! I was able to surprise my hubs with a delicious cupcake to reveal the babys gender. Such a great customer experience.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This is a serious post. I am completely and utterly in love with the chocolate cake. It's real, we love each other, and I'm taking it to my hometown to meet my parents.

Coffee Shop 53,"This is just for the peanut butter chocolate slice cake. I love peanut butter & chocolate together. But I like to taste both with they have been combined. This cake slice missed the mark. Both myself & my 16 year old son walked away disappointed in the lack of chocolate flavor.  Had a large Chai tea, that also lacked good flavor.  Thank goodness my wife & kids got some cupcakes. The chocolate/ chocolate were delicious.  I am sure there are many other tasty selections. But the PBC slice cake needs some improvement.",0
Coffee Shop 53,"The staff there are apparently very busy.  They walk in and out of the kitchen without (or avoiding) making eye contact with customers.  Even though there's a line of customers waiting there, we had to wait for somebody to show up at the registry.  The three stars are for the taste of the desserts.  They are absolutely delicious, except that the brownies are a bit mushy.  They all taste very rich, making me wonder how healthy they were... maybe I shouldn't worry about that about desserts...  ------- Update on : I just noticed that the manager actually responded to my comment a few days after I posted it.  I am very happy that they take customers' comments seriously and try to address them immediately.  So here's one more star for that!   We did went back once in February (2 months later).  There was a line (probably as always) too, but this time there was somebody at the registry.  We got a variety of desserts except for the brownies because I didn't know at the time that the manager had promised to address the issue.  Next time I'll get some brownies and will let you all know what I think!  ;-)",1
Coffee Shop 53,"All of their baked goods are delicious.  I also love the fact that if you come in after 6 pm (or 6:30pm), you get buy one, get one free on their pastries.  They have exceptional gingerbread.  It's incredibly moist and you can definitely taste the fresh ginger in it.  They also have a salted oatmeal cookie that is to die for.  I never thought that combo would work, but it's perfect together.  I've been meaning to try their sandwiches; from what I've heard, those are amazing too.  There's really no way to go wrong with this place.  It's a must try.",1

Coffee Shop 53,"Quack's was amazing! I loved the kitschy interior, spacious tables and fast wifi (clearly this is a go-to study spot for UT students in the area). But beyond that the coffee was fabulous, smooth and dark without tasting burnt - the best I had while I was in Austin. I didn't try any of the baked goods or desserts but they looked incredible.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"This is the ole school town coffee place. Everyone around come here for a good coffee and small breakfast in the morning. The coffee isn't specialty coffee but its solid diner style black water! They have a wide variety of pastries available. I'm a scone fanatic so I had to try their walnut scone! SOOOOGOOD!!! My Texan friends got some sort of hot bread with vegetarian sausages wrapped in it. Another one of my visiting vegan friends was amazed that it was made of vegetables because it tasted so good, so hit that up too! There is plenty of seating, but it can get quite busy in there during breakfast hours. The prices! I fell in love with the prices! My scone was huge and it was $2! After having paid $4-6 for smaller pastries in NYC this was an amazing change of pace.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"2 check-ins Bloody amazing.  Parking can be a tricky one, but that's to be expected in town.  Had a big sugar craving and headed up here.  I had to wait in line, but i didn't care!

But it was all delicious and gave me indulgences for the entire weekend!",1
Coffee Shop 53,Great local bakery and coffee shop. Excellent service and yummy treats of all description. If you are fortunate enough to live in the Hyde Park area lucky you.,1
Coffee Shop 53,This is the key lime pie and German chocolate cake! Three letters O-M-G...AND prices are super duper cheap. The environment is so laid back and old school and the employees are awesome too. Thanks so much for letting me get my fix late at night. I love the fact that you guys close at 11 p.m. As a former waitress you probably hate it but it's so worth it my friends. Everywhere else is closed and Quack's gets the thumbs up. Fresh pastries and good coffee Key Lime pie and German chocolate cake!,1
Coffee Shop 53,"The best breakfast ever is a piece of tiramisu at 5:45am with coffee, of course. I am savoring one as I write to you.  Easy to park and run in with kids in tow and get filled up on sweets, caffeine, and people watching. They have vegan cupcakes, but no specifically dedicated gluten-free cakes, cookies, cupcakes, etc ... My daughter was slightly disappointed, but we made a special stop at another place for her on the way home. My favorite item to get as gifts are the decorated cookies, whose design changes constantly and has a seasonal theme. I get so excited anticipating what will be in my line of sight.  The tables are 1st come, 1st seat and you will need to clean your table yourself. As you line-up to order at their counter, each step allows you to linger in front of the display case of goodies. It is hard to make up your mind. Sometimes I just get everything I want and deal with it later in the privacy of my home.  Tiramisu for breakfast is pretty great. You got to try this!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Placed an order at 9:30, they waited until midnight to tell me that the order had been canceled. They should have let me know up front that it couldn't be done so I could make other plans. A lot of people are disappointed by this crappy way to treat customers.",0

Their baked goods are always of the highest quality. Top notch icing skillz. Very seasonal decorating, which makes me smile. Perfect for when you have some free time (like while doing laundry next door) and right by the post office. The music is pretty chill.  The coffee is nothing special but it's not bad by any means. Pro tip: the lattes and cappuccinos are what clog up the line. If you are going to order one of these, know what you want and move along so others can order. But don't venture too far and make 'em yell for ya. Unicorns today at Q.",1

Quack's 43rd Street Bakery makes all their baked goods, and it's hard to choose from among the many temptations. It's located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of central Austin.  I also ordered a Cajun turkey sandwich with jalapeños and melted Pepper jack on sourdough with spicy spread. Yes even the lettuce gets the panini treatment, which gives the lettuce a wilty texture, so I'd suggest you order this sammy without the lettuce. They don't make the sandwich bread in-house. While I was satisfied with the sandwich, it wasn't outstanding.  My Crowbar latte had 4 shots of espresso. Smooth and strong. I'm awake Austin! Excellent espresso!  There are plenty of tables, and a coffee house atmosphere with eclectic music. Next time I'm in the area, I NEED to try the key lime tart at Quack's.  Quack's earns 4 stars because it's a great choice for bakery treats and coffees when you're in the Hyde Park area. But I wouldn't drive out of my way to get to Quack's if a sandwich was what I was craving. On the other hand, if fresh pie and an excellent iced espresso were on my mind, I might drive out of my way for their great bakery.  My suggestion to the owners is to create a 5-star sandwich which Yelpers will dream about at home or at work. Create a sandwich which entices hungry Yelpers to drive out of their way for. A 5 star sandwich wins out over the competition.  Quack's has the atmosphere of a relaxing coffee house with eclectic music. The owners may wish to get more creative with the decor and the ""vibe"", if they want to create an unforgettable impression on new customers.    On my next visit to Austin, I look forward to returning to Quack's if I'm in the neighborhood, and I recommend that you give their great bakery a try! Lunch at Quack's: his iced green tea, my Crowbar latte, our coconut cream pie, and my Cajun turkey panini sandwich. My Cajun turkey sandwich with jalapeños spiced up my day! Quacks. (-; Coconut cream pie $3.99. Very fresh & yummy at Quack's.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Always high quality great desserts. Have been over 30 times and am never disappointed. Have been for breakfast and desserts. Recommend their coconut cream pie, black and white cupcakes, salted oatmeal cookie and ginger cookie. Funny super nice characters work behind the counter.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Ahhhh Quacks! The place is crazy, existential, aromatic, ethereal.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Possibly the best bakery in Austin. The croissants, muffins, danishes, scones, and cookies are all really good, and most of these pastries are under $3. They also offer cakes and pies whole or by the slice, French macarons, petit fors, cupcakes, eclairs, etc in the cold cases...it's like a breakfast + dessert dream come true. I'm pretty sure their secret is putting a ton of actual butter in everything. The shop is bright and inviting, with lots of windows and small tables for a quick chat over coffee, or for students to hunker down for a bit. I love that they are open until 11pm every day! Very friendly employees. Watch out for the Salty Oat cookie - it lives up to it's salty name!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Updated review Quack's back. And it's not whack.  I think they just had some new staff/training issues, but it tastes like it's been all worked out.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I love everything that Quack's sells but I just remembered why I HATE going there. I was just there about 20 minutes ago getting two very simple items, coffee and some pastries. From the very first moment, the barista seemed annoyed that I even existed. I was waiting to see if the hot croissants with meat were coming out so maybe I took more than a few seconds to order. The man was so annoyed with me, so I tried to make a joke. He didn't respond in any way and it just got so awkward that it almost ruined my morning. You shouldn't have your morning ruined because a barista thinks he's cooler than everyone. I've dealt with this year after year there.  Never. again.",0
Coffee Shop 53,DO NOT BUY THEIR PRE-made cakes! I bought two yesterday for my daughters birthday. They do not know how to bake. I mean I've never bought anything from their bakery but if I had to judge them by the cakes we bought for my daughter then yeah they r amateurs to say the least! No kid or adult at our party ate this disgusting cakes. We called them and let them know but they asked us to bring them back. I didn't because our party was being held in Pflugerville and we live in ELGIN. So I cut my losses but head my review DO NOT ORDER THEIR DISGUSTING GREASY YES GREASY TASTING ICING ON WHAT SEEMED LIKE LEFT OLD DRIED OUT CAKE!!!,0
Coffee Shop 53,"[UPDATED] Have tried almost all their savory snacks, and this is most of the times my brunch place to go on weekends or sometimes weekdays. My fav snacks would be pesto asiago croissant, tomato cheddar croissant, kolaches, turkey croissant, everything croissant (in that order). :)  [OLD REVIEW] I went in there today and bought regular kolachies and everything bagel. Kolachies were really very good. Very different from the others i have had before. Wish I could say the same for bagel. The bagel, according to my co-worker who had it, was stale. Like the one that has been there for more than a day. Kolachies were certainly fresh. I would go there again to try there other snacks but I am not sure about the bagel :(",1
Coffee Shop 53,"The last time I was at Quack's, I was waxing on and on about a failed relationship to a distant relative of Amelia Earhart who wouldn't shut up about how annoying it was that Hilary Swank got cast in that movie that nobody watched. I mean, yeah, you can barely understand me and my whining through the baked goods I'm shoveling into the hole in my face, but do you really have to add insult to injury by bringing up Hilary Swank when you know I have a personal vendetta against her!? I digress.  Needless to say, I was long overdue for a visit. I ordered an iced coffee to start on while I took about an hour to decide on what I wanted. I narrowed it down to two and did what anyone trying to cut back on calories would do: I ordered both of them. The sour cream coffee cake and the vegan lemon blueberry cupcake. I can't decide which one I liked more. When baked goods are this perfect, I'm going to choose to believe that calories don't exist. Because why would they?  The staff are all awesome, the atmosphere is great for reading, eating, studying, reading, chewing, talking, not talking, and any other activity you could want to do in a coffee shop or a bakery. I'm going to have to start going back here more often. More holiday cookies! Holiday cookies! Vegan lemon blueberry cupcake See all photos from John R. for Quack's 43rd Street Bakery",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I absolutely love this place. I am a real coffee snob and I love cold brew. Quacks makes the BEST cold brew and at the most reasonable price-- only $2.20 for 20oz! I'm also a huge fan of all their baked good. I recommend any of their cookies, the salted caramel brownie, and their keylime pie!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Quacks you never fail to deliver. I love your cookies and brownies, which are always a delicious treat. Keep those croissants coming because the flaky buttery goodness they serve up is amazing!",1
Coffee Shop 53,"2 check-ins If you want a great coffee and pastry place in Hyde Park, Quacks is the place to go. They have a great selection of pastries. Every time I go, I want to buy one of each. You will not be disappointed!  The usuals are typical Austinites.  People are nice, mostly on their laptops browsing away.  The only thing I wish Quacks had is comfortable seating. The tables outside are pretty tiny but perfect if you need a place to read while enjoying your fresh cup of brew.",1
Coffee Shop 53,Mine and my family's favorite pastry place in Austin. Best blueberry scones!,1
Coffee Shop 53,"Had the chocolate almond croissant and it was excellent. I wouldn't say that it's the coziest environment, but it has a good atmosphere and lots of natural lighting.  What I really like about this place is the staff--Kanella was especially awesome. She talked me through some of the options and then made me a custom drink when I couldn't decide what to get. The end result was sweet (not not too sweet) with thick foam and great flavor.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"I love the vegan trail mix cookie perfect, not too sweet. I do not even like cookie that much but I am going get one, it has to be this one.",1
Coffee Shop 53,This place is freaking delicious. Best iced chai latte + ginger cookie I've ever had. The only reason I'm giving them 1 less than 5 is because the interior could use a make over. giant ginger cookie + ice chai latte = big cheesin' :D,1
Coffee Shop 53,"Great pastries. Great coffee. Fast internet. Has a few outlets.  Can be crowded, minimal parking. So keep that in mind.",1
Coffee Shop 53,"Well this is what everyone in Austin loves which is weirdness.  The place needs a serious cleaning and a new ceiling.  Now for the baked goods.  To sum it up not so great.    The cookies are dry and very sandy.  We bought blueberry Danish and the crust was very chewy and not all that great.  The peanut butter cookies were very dry and thumb print cookies have an odd after taste.  Not something I would buy again.  The baked goods are VERY pricey and look a whole lot better than they taste.  Not worth the effort to get there.  In response to the manager's response.  Your all natural ingredients don't work well together.  The butter may be something special but it leaves an odd after taste.  The place is grungy and in desperate need of a face lift and a good cleaning I don't care how weird you want to keep the place it should have a clean sense about it especially when serving food.  I consumed the purchase the day I purchased them so it wasn't like it sat around for a day or two.  In general everything I purchased was dry.  I will say the peanut butter cookie stood up well to a hot cup of coffee and did not fall apart when dunked.  The coffee  helped mask any after taste.  So if your idea of a good time is going to a grungy, hipster establishment then this place is for you.  Typical Austin, a promise that results in a serious falling short of meeting of expectations.  I will say again everything LOOKS a whole lot better than it tastes.  I would think the taste is what a bakery of all places should be all about.",0
Coffee Shop 53,One of the best places to eat pie in Austin. I'm also a fan of the cookies and breakfast pastries. She's a fan of the chocolate cupcakes.  Also a great place to do some hipster watching. Just try not to trip over the dogs that are inevitably tied up at the front door.,1
Coffee Shop 53,"Awesome cupcakes & pastries, good coffee, and friendly service. I had the carrot cake cupcake with cream cheese icing and an iced latte. I was in heaven. My hubby got the Magic Almond Bar and the thai iced tea. Neither one of us was disappointed. I also got the banana nut bread to go. It was PERFECTION. If you have a sweet tooth or need a caffeine boost, check out Quack's!",1
Coffee Shop 35,Super cool-looking place with great coffee and very helpful and kind staff.,1
Coffee Shop 35,"I stumbled into this little gem based off of its convenient location, to where I was posted last Saturday.  Oh-em-g in love.  The service was so incredibly nice. The selection was mind blowing. very much looking forward to my next trip. Suffice it to say....I'd go out of my way to return just for the friendly workers. Thank you! Definitely left with a big smile on my face, and some delicious Kombucha.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Once you get past the sophomoric name and the bike-bro trappings, you're left with pretty much everything you want from a coffee shop: comfortable seating (inside and out), friendly baristas, reliable WiFi and good coffee.  They even have their own (free) parking lot, which is pretty much unheard of downtown these days.  Watch out for those early closing times, though. This is definitely not a night spot.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Who knew a great coffee shop was hiding in a bike shop? I found one in Juan Perlota. I got a delicious Latte after viewing the board discussing the espresso used and the notes after tasting. My nephew and niece got smoothies. We enjoyed both. I enjoyed the environment, but I'm not sure it was as relaxing as some coffee shops. If you are a bike enthusiast, this would be like heaven. But, I'm not, so it was a lot to take in sitting instead of peddling.. Latte!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"LOVE the vibe! Parking lot was a total plus, I love this part of Austin, and as a student trying to study, I enjoyed a little bit of people watching inbetween.  I'm not a biker, but the shop itself was neat, a little rugged/industrial/open ceilings. My kombucha and drip coffee was as good as any other place I've had in town! Outside porch. Lots of bikers stopping through",1
Coffee Shop 35,"This place looked nice from the outside but it definitely wasn't great as a coffee shop overall. The staff are pretty nice, but it's more a stop for the people coming in for the biking shop. Speaking of which, the smell of rubber from the bike shop makes enjoying your coffee a bit difficult. I also wasn't a big fan of the cinnamon roll since it broke apart much too easily for one to eat - is the glaze supposed to be crunchy?  Also, not really a big deal to me but worth noting to some - wifi is a bit slow.",0
Coffee Shop 35,"I love hanging out here on Saturdays after visiting the Farmer's Market on 4th St. They have a friendly staff and a delicious Hot Chocolate!  Beware people and groups that use two or more tables to put their laptops, backpacks and other stuff. You may have to ask politely for them to use less room and be more sharing of the common space.  The background music is at the right volume so you're not bothered by it.  Many cyclists will come by as this seems to be their pit stop downtown and where they socialize with the cyclist community. It's awesome to see their engagement!  Also enjoy the bike shop where the coffee shop is located at! I sure do! Cozy coffee spot.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"3 check-ins One of the best! Great coffee, great service and phenomenal wifi. If you come on a good day expect some eye candy from the attached bike shop. You can go across the street and get sandwiches from royal blue grocery so this is practically my new office. Not a ton of outlets, but a pretty good number for the open space, garage atmosphere. Oh and did I mention they have a parking lot in downtown Austin? Stellar. You'll find tons of Austinites coming in for meetings during the day. This place pulls a good crowd of intelligent, nice, interested people from the downtown offices. Very casual business meetings. Love the service here, always super friendly and nice.",1
Coffee Shop 35,Great coffee and a great atmosphere.  The staff was super friendly and it's inside a bike shop!  I love this concept of dual purpose space.  I have been there every morning on this trip to Austin.,1
Coffee Shop 35,Great coffee and super cool staff!   Nice café at the Mellow Johnny's bike shop.   Excellent pumpkin bread and Blueberry muffins too!   Looks like an awesome spot for a post-ride coffee and snack!,1
Coffee Shop 35,"Cute location with a bike shop within  Good smoothies, but just not a lot of food options",1
Coffee Shop 35,"3 check-ins I can not emphasize how much I love visiting this coffee shop.  It is located inside of Mellow Johnny's Bike Shop.  Therefore, most visitors are cyclists.  There are 3 sections with one section located in the bike shop and they ALLOW dogs! Simple menu of coffees, teas, and hot coco.  You can order a few snacks or bites.  Park near the store and pay for the max 3 hrs.  But, I think they are cool about you parking in the private bike lot.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Updated review Listen, you don't have to believe that the best place to get coffee in Austin is in a bike shop. It just is. Actually, it makes sense - lots of baristas are cyclists. They brew Stumptown, and they pull it right.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Great coffee (Stumptown Coffee Roasters from Portland, OR), great staff, and great breakfast tacos (Fresa's) in a cool bike shop atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Idk who this Juan Pelota guy is but he makes a damn good cup of coffee.  I stumbled upon this place by accident when I was wandering downtown after finding out my favorite brunch spot had closed. Mourning its loss I decided to drown my 1st world sorrows in coffee but  little did I know I was in for a treat.  The place is clean,  the staff is nice, and the cinnamon apple whatever else muffin is so good I punched a baby. I was initially taken aback by the $5 price tag on my vanilla soy latte but damn,  take my money!  Whatever coffee bean,  drug,  or unicorn tears they add to their beverages to makes them creamy and luxurious- I want it.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"5 check-ins Love their coffee and the bike store attached has a lot of inspiring work out accessories.  For example I had an Americans with extra shot then bought some mild compression riding socks!  Love the combination of good coffee, canine, and a fitness/bike store.    The baristas are friendly if a bit shy and the seating area is pleasant enough.  On a nice day one could enjoy the outdoor seating. Ginger snap cookie and hazelnut iced latte.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"This place is a comfy coffee shop attached to a store and offers basics for coffees and nibbles. They have outdoor and indoor seating and allow pets on the patio. It's a cool place to sit and work through emails or a quick coffee / catch up with a friend before heading out somewhere. Staff is friendly.  They have breakfast Tacos, but I've definitely tasted better. I'd stick to their coffee and cookies.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"BEST almond milk laté ever, super cool and friendly staff, lots of seating. Not too crowded. Great downtown location. My favorite coffee shop in Austin so far. I've been here 3-4 times over the past week and it's consistently a great experience.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"The lattes were great, cheaper than most places around downtown, and the service was just as great. The baristas are friendly  and the pastries look really good! So far one of my favorite coffee shops downtown. It's connected to a bike store and closes earlier than most places, but that's ok! Latte !",1
Coffee Shop 35,"17 check-ins Been hitting pelota since 2007.   Ben turned me on to the cold brew cross with coffee and if I'm adventurous, add a double shot on top!  Place has been renovated a few times for the better.   Workers are top notch, and launch u into whatever u might get into.   All around a solid joint. 3/4 coffee, 1/4 Cold Toddy",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Great coffee and the nicest staff! The Migas breakfast taco is surprisingly really good. Busy, but never too crowded and dog-friendly :)",1
Coffee Shop 35,Great if you are not in a hurry. Lots of idle chit chat at the register and a barrista in slo mo,0
Coffee Shop 35,So this is my favorite coffee spot in town. They have excellent assortment of coffee and tea's as well as smoothies and treats. Also they keep it pretty quiet in their for a coffee/bike shop! I'm also a fan of their staff typically inviting and fun.,1
Coffee Shop 35,They make their mochas the old-fashioned way with the actual Ghirardelli chocolate powder.  The guys who work the coffee counter are always extremely nice and personable.  Enjoy stopping by there anytime I'm going to the Austin Music Hall.,1
Coffee Shop 35,"Great place, good beats not too loud, high tables make great standing desks for working!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Friendly baristas, cute austiny decor, bicycle pit stop. The barista was very helpful with explaining chemex vs beehouse, the types of coffees available, where the baked foods came from. I got the beehouse Burundi kayanzi and a chocolate muffin. All good. My only suggestion would be for them to label prices on all the baked, bottled, and packaged goods. There's also patio seating available and you can bring your puppy. Free parking. Recommended!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Witty (Juan ball... One ball... Lance Armstrong...) and great coffee at this spot. Popular with cyclists bc it's part of a bike shop, a nice little coffee joint. Such great coffe",1
Coffee Shop 35,"A coffee shop within a bike shop! How random, yet perfectly Austin.  This place automatically gets brownie points for a few things - the hilarious/clever name and the fact that they serve Stumptown Coffee.  Wifi here is mediocre so maybe not the best place to get work done, but I love the ambiance - great place to catch up with a friend, people watch, read, etc.  Really appreciate the organic snack options JP offers as well.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Used to work nearby so I would stop in for an espresso or late occasionally. Skilled baristas and great espresso. Shared with a bike shop, reminds me of the cyclists at the coffee shops near Mt. Tam in Marin",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Adjoined to a bike shop, makes an interesting lay out for this cafe. The location is a far walk from work, so I won't be able to visit as frequent as I would like. I typically order a coffee from somewhere at lunch, but this actually one of the better ones in the area.  I ordered an Americano (start looking at my posts and you will see that is typically what I order everywhere) in a 12 oz cup. The flavor and strength was perfect!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Most of the patrons at this coffeeshop are athletic-looking and dressed in serious cycling gear, making me feel like a couch potato the moment I walked in.  It shares a building with Mellow Johnny's, a high-end bicycle store.  I got the cold mocha on a warm summer day and it was pretty good.  The barista was nice, smiley, and unpretentious.  The drinks are fairly-priced.  The cold mocha was $4 pre-tax.  You pay on an iPad.  There is a neat conference table shaped like a tree.  There are comfortable chairs near electrical outlets.  There is free Wifi.  I like the tall windows letting in lots of natural light.  There is lots of covered outdoor seating.  I'd be there if the sun wasn't shining on it.  The background music playing right now is some bluegrass banjo country stuff.  I don't like it.    Juan Pelota is located on the Northwest quadrant of the 4th and Nueces intersection. Coolest table ever",1
Coffee Shop 35,"When you work remotely, finding the perfect office space is a difficult but important task. After trying out a number of options, I've settled in at Juan Pelota (JP, as I call it)! The coffee is delicious, they have breakfast tacos (although they usually sell out pretty quickly!) and solid treat options, my favorite smoothie ever (Golden Calf with a shot of espresso), ample outlets and seating, a sizable parking lot, and free-- and fast-- wifi. Add in the friendliest staff in town and an ambience that is relaxed, welcoming, but lively enough to keep me from falling asleep on slow mornings and you've got my favorite office space of all time!!",1
Coffee Shop 35,I had them heat up a cream cheese pastry in the toaster oven and it was the best pastry I had all week. A bit on the expensive side at $4. The coffee comes in large mugs which is good for those of us who don't care for getting up to do refills often. I love the atmosphere with it being integrated with the bike shop. Service was really good. Coffee and cream cheese pastry with a side of cyclist,1
Coffee Shop 35,Thanks y'all! This place has great coffee (really nice quality).  The staff is very welcoming and the atmosphere is nice. I'm so glad I stopped in here after ditching Halcyon.  I'll be back!,1
Coffee Shop 35,"47 check-ins Listed in Great Austin Coffee Houses The barista at Juan Pelota's asked me if this was my first time at Juan Pelota's and I had to admit yes.  I also had to admit that when in this part of downtown I usually gravitate to Halcyon for my coffee fix.  Luckily they weren't offended and even told me that they concur that Halcyon has great coffee.  Though theirs is better.  And better is probably accurate.  As others have noted Juan Pelota brews Stumptown coffee out of Portland which is pretty rad.  Not only that but on my visit they were specifically brewing Stumptown's Hair Bender blend which is my favorite.  I had my coffee at 6PM and couldn't get off to sleep until 3AM.  It does the trick which is what makes caffeine the #1 most consumed drug in the entire world.  Note that a regular sized iced latte will set you back (including tip, and you should definitely tip) around $5.  This is higher than most coffee drinks downtown, even with the downtown premium built in.  But I promise it will be worth it.  As Kelly S noted since this place shares the building with Mellow Johnny's it is Guy Central.  As in very cute, very athletic guy central.  The 2 hours that I hung out there working on my laptop I discovered that I was the only female in the entire joint including both those who hung out inside and grabbed their coffee to go.    They close at 7PM during the week and 5PM on weekends so not a good late night coffee spot.  But during the day when in this part of downtown I will definitely be making more coffee stops here for some of that lovely Stumptown coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Spent any afternoons sipping americanos and getting work done here. Great atmosphere and such a kind staff. Love all the windows, it really makes the whole cafe open up and you feel like you're outside, but it's nice and cool inside. My husband loves the bike shop and I have got a number of their shirts for him.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"This is a chill coffee shop located inside--well really just occupying the same space as--a high-end bike shop. The combination of some nice tables, really good espresso and the somewhat funky feeling of being in a shared space with the bike shop just sort of works. It makes the place feel different and homey while still a bit edgy.  They also have nice outdoor seating and free wifi which makes it an overall win.",1
Coffee Shop 35,This coffee shop is part of a clothing store and a bicycle store. Their coffee is excelent. I ordered a capuchino and a oatmeal bar. There is free wifi and outlets to charge your gadgets.,1
Coffee Shop 35,"Updated review Stumptown coffee and smoothies to recharge, plus a bike shop!  Lotsa biker dudes with nice buns for people-watching and a cool modern atmosphere.

Adding to my review-they carry some baked Gluten Free goods by Karen from Blackbird Bakery, as well as sell her flour blends there.  BEST GF pie blend I have ever had.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"This place offers single-origin pour over coffee, vegan lattés, free parking, and some outdoor seating. Wi-fi and big tables with power outlets make it a good destination for studying. Recently they've taken to a Pandora mix-up of modern thrash punk rock and R & B. Personally, I find most of their music selection to be distracting when I'm working or studying. I'm in the market for a coffee shop with a chiller vibe but this place offers many awesome perks for group studying that are hard to match.  During the week they usually have green cart vegetarian wraps and a small selection of other sandwiches. They also have healthy smoothies, gluten-free black bird pastries and fancy, single-origin chocolate. Juan pelota is unique in that it's attached to Mellow Johnny's bike shop, which has showers for cyclists. The toilets don't flush very well, but the bathrooms still remain clean.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Super friendly, cute ambience, and free parking. It's attached to Mellow Johnny's, and while I'm not a biker what-so-ever, I enjoy watching all the enthusiasts come back from rides together. It's a cool sense of community they've created by morphing the two businesses together.  Coffee and tacos = yummy in my tummy Baristas = always seem friendly and comfortable ""being themselves""",1
Coffee Shop 35,"9 check-ins My absolute favorite place to work and study. Great coffee, awesome baristas, excellent people watching, loads of outlets, and pub height desks so I can stand while I work. Perfection.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Good place. Came in because I can't stand Texas weather once it hits 80 degrees and needed a place to chill for a bit. Simply put: great staff, great environment. The only thing I would recommend would be to use up more of the bike space so that more people could sit.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Sure, coffee isn't their main business, as this is an extension of Mellow Johnny's. It's bikes. But this has become one of my favorite coffee places in Austin, alongside Jo's on South Congress.  Thing is, I'm a stickler about the environment I'm sitting in. Being an architect will do that to you. Most coffee places are too dark, with uncomfortable seating, and obnoxious music. Juan Pelota has giant, south facing shaded windows, meaning there's always plenty of light and no glare, modern and comfortable chairs, and practically no music in the background. Instead, there is the white noise of an active bike shop, which I prefer. Plus, it never gets too crowded.  As for the coffee, I've only gotten the iced versions, which are really, really strong. My friend thinks they are too strong. It depends on your preferences, I guess, since my other friend appreciated how strong the drinks were. I'm not much of a coffee aficionado outside of cappuccinos, so I can't say more than that. And I haven't had their cappuccino yet.  But mainly, I just really like sitting here, getting work done inside, or sitting on the patio catching up with friends. And having Mellow Johnny's attached it a plus. Really nice people, really helpful with my bike questions, and lots of cool stuff. A new go-to place in downtown.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Loving this place so far. I've been in Austin a month and been working from as many coffee shops as possible. For me the difference lies in the details. Helpful staff who are happy to have a conversation, simple syrup and chocolate powder at the sugar station, ubiquitous new wall outlets, nice dark wood tables that don't wobble. (Of course I haven't checked all the tables but I did just see a girl check one's stability- it met her sturdiness standards so she took a seat.) It looks like they may have taken notice of the reviewer who complained about thin wooden chairs, as they now have sturdy, functional metal ones and a comfy leather-padded bench against the back wall.  They currently have a large projector screen showing the Tour de France on mute (they do share space with a bike shop, but there's been no problem with noise or hustle bustle). Not sure if that's a regular thing, but if it's on and you want to ignore it, you can face squarely away from it at any of the tables.  The only issue I had was that WiFi was down when I arrived. Mistakes happen, but it's how you resolve the problem that matters. I brought up the problem and it was fixed in no time. I suggested that they add a password to the router so the neighbors might stop overloading it; we'll see if they take that advice.  The best testament to how much I like the place is that this is my first Yelp review. I'll be back, and not only to say hello to Genevieve! Few things I appreciate more than nice, new, ubiquitous wall outlets at coffee shops.",1

Coffee Shop 35,"Let's start with the beans, they're Stumptown, which if you're from or ever visited Portland, OR, Austin's hip(si)ster-city, you probably are very familiar with these beans and extremely excited to hear this.  If you're from anywhere else, just know that they're well regarded and probably roast while wearing ironic monocles.    Continuing on with the service; since this is my morning coffee spot, it's rare that I am able to converse with anyone in any intelligible way because my brain is repetitively sending one single message: ""get coffee you stupid sleep-deprived moron"" (my brain is very condescending).  At this place, I especially dislike having this disposition because they probably have the friendliest baristas of any coffee shop in Austin.  They ask you how you're doing, they joke with you, they draw cool pictures in your dirty chai.  They just seem genuinely happy, and it's a great way to start your day, even if you're not quite there yet.  Finally, they also serve breakfast tacos.  I realize this is basically mandatory of any coffee shop in Austin, but it's something that needs to be pointed out.  They also have your normal coffee shop fare: yogurt, pastries, juices, etc. so if you're in need of something non-caffeinated, they've got you covered.  To recap: delicious hipster coffee, awesome service and of course breakfast tacos.  Five stars.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Juan Pelota has slowly started to win my heart.. I avoided it at first, because I went once and the breakfast taco was really greasy, and the coffee so so but after giving it a second chance I visit quite often for my daily coffee fix.  The coffee is always delicious, and strong (a regular shot of espresso is actually two!) and never too hot to enjoy-a big pet peeve of mine. I've tried a few of the pastries, and its sort of hit or miss but everything is organic and all natural, and they offer a good selection of healthy snacks for when you're on the go.  The barista's are always friendly and helpful (not obnoxiously upbeat as some starbucks baristas can be), and after so long they remember your order. The wait time can be kind of long, so skip it if you're in a hurry, but that's just because everything is done fresh-no big things of steamed milk or pre-ground beans sitting around.  Granted, this place is super convienient for me because it's a block away from work but I will keep coming back-try a caramel latte or iced mocha-delish!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"You might get what you ordered, you might get something totally different. But, as the barista at Juan Pelota told me today ""it's all the same.""  She made a cappuccino, called out ""cappuccino!"" and then after we stood there another five minutes waiting for my latte with hazelnut syrup, we asked her ""was this supposed to be a latte?"" She said yes. I said, ""but you called a cappuccino."" She replied, ""it's all the same anyways.""  So, I got to drink a cold cappuccino that had sat for five minutes rather than the drink I paid for.  We stopped here on a cycle today. Next time, I'll try to steer the guys to another place for drinks and pastries on a ride.",0
Coffee Shop 35,"I found this place just as I was about to place my monthly 5 pounds of beans order  from Stumptown.  My husband and I are full-time RVers and spend our summers in Portland, so I've grown accustomed to great coffee and just order it directly from there.  My favorite beans are Stumptown's Hair Bender blend.  As I was looking up Stumptown, I came across a Yelp review about JP and the use of ST's beans.  Was I dreaming this?  Really?  I can get my favorite coffee in Austin?  Yes!  When I went, they were out of the beans I wanted, but told me to come back the next day.  The barista made me a wonderful latte with a Texas shape on top...damn, and he was pretty accurate!  I found out they get freshly-roasted beans delivered on Tues & Fridays.  So hey, Austin, you want good coffee, check them out.  And if you make your own espresso/caps/lattes at home, buy a bag of the Hair Bender beans.  Mighty yummy!  One more thing - It was really refreshing to go to a coffee shop with Portland coffee, without the Portland barista attitude.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"3 check-ins Listed in Yelp 365 Challenge, Austin, TX We are from out of town and we make a point to come here!  We love coming for coffee and a breakfast taco!  Try the papas, egg and cheese - the papas are mashed potatoes - awesome!  We also loved the papas, beans and cheese. Great coffee, nice servers, good time!  19/365",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Updated review 2 check-ins Update: had a pretty decent chocolate chip scone here... but more importantly,  fantastic iced black tea.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"My favorite spot to grab coffee and catch up on E-mails. The staff has always been friendly and chipper, the space is both rustic and excellent, and I enjoy the bicycle traffic. To be fair, it can be a little noisy at times for my taste, but Juan Pelota's is a more than a solid choice if you're stopping  in for a cup of coffee with a friend.  Highly recommend.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"This cafe attached to Mellow Johnny's bike shop is quite good. Really good coffee(I think it's Stumptown). Good access to plugs and wifi. Also, free bike magazines to read.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"The number one happiest way to start your Magnificent Monday, Terrific Tuesday, Wonderful Wednesday, Top Notch Thursday, Fabulous Friday, Super Saturday, or Spry Sunday!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"JP's is a very functional cafe for me. After a nice cycling trek down from the northern regions it is always nice to stop and refuel. Juan Pelota's is able to provide this in various forms to satisfy the padded shorts and Lycra jersey crowd or shoppers/workers in the downtown area. A Vanilla or Carmel Latte usually does the trick for me before heading back on the road. Coconut water, fresh muffins, scones, croissants and very good breakfast tacos are other options i have enjoyed. They also have cool, locally made health bars such as the Thunderbird Energetica's. There are also sandwiches as well but i have not tried them yet. They have several different coffee blends and after some recommendations from JP's staff, i bought their house blend and an Ethiopian blend as Christmas gifts this year.  It's always an interesting place to come and sit and see all the different kinds of folks who pop in down there.  I often thought how great it would be if they were located more closer to home and away from Condomania. But that's the allure of Juan Pelota's for me. Half the fun is the anticipation and the ride just getting there.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Juan Pelota is your outrageously Austin coffee shop. It is based on a certain cyclist's ... um, single most prized possession. It is located in a crazy bike shop. The awesome employees enjoy their job, at least that is how it seems. Why would you want to grab a cup o' joe here? I guess parking or getting here is sort of an issue, as it is tucked back into a little west-downtown corner.  They follow the trend of offering ""local, green, hip"" caffeinated beverages, munchies, and things of the like. I just wanted a house dark, but they had decided to dump the older batch and brew a new one. They offered to brew me a pour-ever. Heck, I did not even see pour-over on the menu. Obviously, I was going to go for the hand-crafted goodness.  I had to wait a few minutes for my pour over, but they rewarded my patience with a dark, bold, and well-poured cup of goodness. Fo' free. They appreciated my ""mellow"" manner, and I very much appreciated their accommodating me with the best means possible: coffee on da' hizzouse.  Get your buzz on here, but I cannot guarantee it will be as affordable as my experience. Regardless, this institution will be inviting to all: caffeine junkies, studiers, bikers; heck, I do not even own a bike. Should I have said that?",1
Coffee Shop 35,2 check-ins Legit lattes-a bit of an awkward location (and parking was difficult-it is downtown after all).  Enjoyed the healthy snack offerings too!,1
Coffee Shop 35,"Do you ever wake up cranky and think ""I wish I'd had that cup of coffee while I was sleeping so I can be peppy right now""? Ok, maybe it's just me. On those mornings, I trot my crabby self over to Juan Pelota for a fresh cup of joe. These guys serve Stumptown Coffee. If you've not had Stumptown before, you'll be in for a real treat. It's from legitimate coffee destinations like Portland and Seattle. Besides the delish coffee, they have yummy pastries delivered daily from Elizabeth Street Cafe. They also have Taco Deli breakfast tacos (mmm...the Jess Special...) in case you're in the mood for something savory. All in all, I'd highly recommend you get your caffeine fix here!",1
Coffee Shop 35,Listed in Austin Coffee Stumptown?! Chemex?! Gluten-free eclair?!,1
Coffee Shop 35,"Best Iced Toddy in Austin, easily. Beats Progress, beats corporate, beats Cherrywood by a mile and a half.  And if you like African espresso, got a single shot. House is Sidamo (cut with Brazilian). Not top of the line, but pretty close.  Not a big fan of the Bess salads and sandwiches, though. Why would you get something four hours old when you could buy it fresh two blocks away? Or hit RB across the street? Weird.  Anyway, go to JP for the coffee. Stay for the conversation. Great crowd.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"I'm in this place at least twice a week.  The coffee is impressive and I'm currently into the Macchiatos.  There is a great vibe, but I'm also a cyclist so I get it.  If you aren't a cyclist I'm not sure what you will think of it, but who cares cause they have great coffee.  It is pretty small so go on a nice morning or afternoon when you can sit outside.",1
Coffee Shop 35,there's a reason I go every morning. So good. They have my dirty chai ready before I check out.  Gotta agree on the nice legz lookin too :)),1
Coffee Shop 35,"I have to laugh at myself when I didn't know Lance owns this coffee place. In fact, I thought that Mellow Johnny next door was only owned by his friend. But, having a coffee place next to a bike store is heaven to me. I could live at these two places. Forget winning the Tour de France, I want to own a bike store and coffee house.  Really good cappuccino too. I hope to come back.",1

Coffee Shop 35,"Listed in hollywood & mine lance, ya know, I think you're great peddling up, a mountain face livestrong, on or off your bike but peddling coffee?, gotta gripe your baristas, let 'em go somewhere else, they're flippin' slow Juan Pelota, ha! get that but it takes balls, to serve those crap py pastries, egg tacos too are lackin', lance, the foods a boo dig your setting, patio riders come and riders go to the counter, order java a hi or howdy? nope, no, nada shit for service, c'mon lance willin' to give, a second chance cuz otherwise, I had ""a ball"" at Juan Pelota,  guy's  gotta call a spade a spade, the bike shop's great but your java joint, is second rate funny man, lance!",0
Coffee Shop 35,"Small, quaint neighborhood coffee shop.  Connected to Mellow's and has a personality all it's own.  Their coffee matches that personality.  Bold and robust yet calming.  Always love the fact that there are bikers stopping to grab a quick one or actually take a moment to unwind - it's all great.  Definitely a place to bring people if they visit.  Nice place to start the morning.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"super cool place, good coffee and smoothies with tacodeli breakfast tacos in the morning.  Its never too crowded and they have space to sit with a laptop inside or outside, and free wi fi",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Listed in Biking to Buda Two words: Brown Cow!  That's a milkshake with banana, peanut butter, and chocolate.  After a forty-mile ride, it's just what I'm looking for.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"I know that the 'barista' (use the term loosely, it's a biker serving coffee) spends time talking about bikes and other things going on but that's what I LIKE about this place.  I don't go here to get a quick cup of coffee and hang out with my computer doing work/school/writing the next great novel.  I come here when I'm out for a ride and taking a break.  And it's AWESOME for that.    I always find something interesting going on at the shop - Mellow Johnny's - and I usually find another rider to talk to.  I come here to hang out with cyclists and have good coffee.  This place and the one in the Bicycle Sport Shop on Lamar are my favorites for that.  The good news about Juan Pelota is that it's close to several bike routes whereas it's a little tougher to get to the Lamar spot.  Don't change anything JP, I love you the way you are.  OK, please change ONE thing - will you please update your coffee bikers on what the weekend ride status is - we go there to join the Mellow Johnny's rides I would expect that the person behind the counter would know what the heck is going on!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"This is your basic coffee stand with a few tables..... nothing fancy, real chill vibe...  Nice cup of joe and all of the clientele are wearing their bike uniforms!!  Not necessarily a real 'go get work done' kind of place, but I will say that the people watching has me QUITE happy because of the beautiful legs these bikers have!! wow!",1
Coffee Shop 35,Come for the coffee.  Stay and shop at the bike store.  Return for the best of 80s music.  Great place.  Made each of my days in Austin that much better.,1
Coffee Shop 35,Fantastic service! Great coffee - never burned or brewed incorrectly. I love the staff at this cafe - they are friendly and genuine.,1
Coffee Shop 35,"Listed in Places I HATE I like cycling and I like Lance, but that's not enough to give Juan Pelota a free pass.  Baristas (baristos?) acted like extreme douches and the coffee itself is very average.  You know what happened once? I asked for a small cup of black coffee and the guy working there informed me that didn't have a size small, they had a (whatever they were calling their smaller cup that day).  I seriously thought I was on a really played out TV comedy from 1996.  I get that Lance Armstrong owns this place, but employees, you didn't win 7 TdF's.  You work in a coffee shop.  You work in the service industry.  You work for tips.  Don't be a prick.",0
Coffee Shop 35,"Listed in Who Let the Dogs Out? You've gotta give props to a man who names a coffee shop -- a *coffee shop* -- after his sole remaining, uh, pelota.  Is that ballsy, or what? Fortunately for Lance Armstrong, his family jewels were well spent on this endeavor.    Juan Pelota is attached to another retail venture of Lance's, bike shop Mellow Johnny's (Yelper Laura C., who accompanied me on my first outing to this retail duo, explained to me that ""mellow johnny"" is a takeoff on the French words for ""yellow jersey,"" ""maillot jeune."")  The coffee shop section of the place is pretty small; just a few little tables inside and a small patio outside with a few more.  In addition to coffee drinks, they also sell smoothies, sandwiches, salads, pastries, and breakfast tacos.  All of the food is made by Bess (Sandra Bullock's restaurant - this is an all-star venture).  I'm not a fan of Bess, so I was pleasantly surprised by the breakfast taco I ate there - it was buttery-rich and delicious.  I've become spoiled by the proliferation of the TacoDeli taco around town - and their addictive dona sauce - so the fact that I was happy with my Juan Pelota taco is sayin' something.  My first outing here was very nice.  Laura and I camped out on the patio for quite a while with my pup.  It was a hot day, but the patio was nicely shaded and caught a lovely breeze.  Lots of dog-lovers shop here; quite a few stopped to say hello to my furry companion.  Afterwards, we wandered through the bike store, and one of the people working there said we could bring my pup in.  Hooray for dog-friendly retail!  Since I've only been here once, I'm not quite ready to award it Yelp's version of the yellow jersey, but it definitely merits a second tour.",1
Coffee Shop 35,Vanilla latte is super smooth and creamy. Highly recommend!,1
Coffee Shop 35,"It has parking and the coffee is great! Sometimes the lines can be ridiculous but that's apparently the price of being so cool. The staff are always pleasant. The ""one ball"" thing is hysterical but that's another story.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Helpful staff, good wifi - a decent place to work from during the day. Plus it's attached to a great bike shop.  The breakfast tacos are ""ok"" at best, they are from Sandra Bullock's bistro. I think LA forgot that bistro's are french and not Mexican. It shows in the taco.  But without a doubt - you MUST try the cold-brewed iced toddy. Amazing. The barista used organic simple sugar and 50/50 in mine (per request) and I don't think I've had a coffee drink as equal to it's greatness in the city of Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"I'm kinda particular about my coffee.  So particular, in fact, that when friends and family came to town for my recent nuptials, I distributed a map with the best coffee in the greater Austin area.    Juan Pelota topped the list.      These folks make a *mind blowing* cappuccino.  The team is friendly, engaging, and obsessed with making a great cup of coffee.  They actually have somewhat healthy and tasty snacks (try the taco salad or the caprese panini).  When the weather is nice they open up the garage door and bring the outside in.  They always have a lovely collection of fit cyclists roaming the grounds.  They even sell the New York Times and The Economist (!).    They also pay attention.  I've noticed that I'm not the only person whose order they have committed to memory.  I appreciate that personal touch.  It's freakishly rare.    If you drive down 5th street every day on your way to a downtown office, it's worth taking a right on Nueces and giving Juan Pelota a try.  I dare say that it might even change your coffee loving life.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"First to Review Friendly service, and a great hibiscus iced tea. Plus a great namesake - Juan Pelota, the omnipresent yet unsung ""Tenth Man"" on the Postal/Discovery TdF squad. (Juan, by odd coincidence, looked almost exactly like Lance Armstrong with a darker tan.) Juan could sprint, Juan could climb, and Juan could even whup testicular cancer.  Plus for an extra $3.99, you can put that iced tea in a Mellow Johnny's water bottle and take it with you on your bike.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Yeah, this place is bomb. The baristas a B-level and ambiance is only okay. It's strange to be in such a bomb coffee joint with so much retail activity, but hey, they got the good stuff. Why is it the good stuff? Because they primarily serve Stumptown. Most gourmet Austin coffee places serve weeks old Cuvee coffee, which is a super basic, acidic, messy outfit. Stumptown is definitely the current top gourmet coffee in the States, in league with only a few others, and definitely not Cuvee. So, here's why this place is good. First, the lighting is really amazing. I could read in front of them big ol' windows all day. Second, the baristas are really nice. They're not experts like you may get in other good spots, but they're accessible and know the basics. Third, the coffee is fresh, the beans are fresh and bomb, and by the proper mixture of service and quality it is consistently great product without the hipster oppressiveness of the other places (think Houndstooth) or the prices of other spots (think Houndstooth or Thunderbird). I'd hit this place up exclusively if I lived closer. Try it out.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Probably the best cappuccino I've ever had. The coffee is AMazing. Don't be in a rush when you go--this is a slow paced place so leave your ""I'm too impatient to wait"" attitude at home.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"I've been here on a few occasions and always got great service and good espresso.  If it isn't obvious, the cafe is in a bike shop owned by Lance Armstrong.  Good food and bakery too imo.  Oh yes, and excellent bike gear, doh.  There's indoor and outdoor seating and a magazine rack with a pretty good diversity of titles.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Italian Job sandwich was just what the doctor ordered during a day of conferencing and a little bit of riding. Outdoor seating provided a welcome respite, too, especially given that there was a power outlet where I could charge my phone during my late lunch. Even caught a brief glimpse of Lance leaving for a ride!",1
Coffee Shop 35,"Best coffee I had in Austin. Employees were friendly, coffee tasted good, and I could entertain myself while my friend shopped at (adjoining) Mellow Johnny's. End of story.",1
Coffee Shop 35,"I went over the holidays, so I can't say much about the lines or parking, but I had the BEST vanilla latte I've ever had.    I'm so sick of sbux, which doesn't even make a good latte anymore and then trying to go local and being treated like crap, like some of the places on 6th.  Everyone was super friendly here and they had breakfast tacos.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I'll start by saying I am not a coffee snob, so I can't tell you how this place ranks against other coffee shops in terms of taste and quality.  This is one of my favorite coffee shops because of the location, ambiance, and view. It's hard to beat.  The bad? The restrooms are atrocious. They smell so bad and everything always seems wet. The kind of wet that seems questionable as to wether its water or pee. Every time I go in to one I think to myself ""I wish I were a boy so I could go out and just pee on a tree"".",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Love Alta's. Great spot to stop if you are riding your bike or jogging on the trail. Good coffee and they serve Tacodeli tacos. Chilled rosé and cheese boards FTW in the evening. Beautiful view of Town Lake, right on the water. They are a bit hidden but worth exploring for a peaceful spot next to the water.  Only downside can be service - when they are busy, it can take a while to get your coffee as they usually only have 2 people working the counter.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"This place is great if the weather is nice and you're looking for a beautiful view smack dab in the middle of downtown. Alta's is located downtown, so there's the typical lack of parking, but if you're in the area, you might as well walk over and grab a snack.  I've had their green smoothie, which was really good, as well as their chai latte. Take advantage of Alta's huge patio space or take your drink down to the trail by the lake. I think this would be a great place to study outdoors since both times I've been it's been relatively quiet and empty.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Wow - a hidden gem.  Alta's is a small, beautiful cafe located next to the lake. There isn't much space inside, but lots of patio space outside looking right over the lake.  The coffee was good! They brew SF Sightglass coffee, which is hella delicious and has a big name for themselves in SF.  More than that, the staff was crazy friendly and kind, and I had a good time studying there.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"There are few places on Town Lake with the view of Altas. It is lovely. I ride my bike here time and time again- because of that one feature- the view. If you want to order food- plan on a minimum 20 - 30 minute wait for a cheese board or toasted bagel. Honestly, the level of service here is disgraceful.  I keep returning because of that one feature- the view, and and each time the poor service islaps me in the face. Just be warned.",0
Coffee Shop 1,"Set your expectations to come to a cafe and don't expect a Michelin star restaurant and Alta's is a treat.  What more can you want from a small, no bs cafe overlooking the lake? It's got impeccable views, friendly staff, and ample seating. I don't expect parking when I come downtown, so I can't dock them for not providing it.  I had the Prosciutto Grilled Cheese and it was great. The bread was fresh and toasted well, the cheese was tight, and the price was fantastic for downtown. My only gripe was the prosciutto could've made a more prominent appearance, but prosciutto is my jam.  There aren't many Austin spots that I would consider ""hidden gems"" to quote an overused cliche, but this is one. No fuss, great cafe food and stellar views that you can't get anywhere else. View from patio Beer! Grilled cheese with prosciutto See all photos from Luci H. for Alta's Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Updated review When I first found this delightful oasis I was running (from the ""freezing"" cold) on the trail. I wanted two things: something warm that would reassure me I wouldn't die in the 45 degree weather and a bathroom (who wants to use a porta-potty anyways?! Especially in the winter wind?!) I ended up finding one of the best lattes I have had in Austin (see previous review). Fast forward to this summer...I decide to take my friend here for a delightful evening of Alta's coffee and good old fashioned board games. The latte is so good, and I mean SO GOOD that I ordered that sucker HOT in the middle of this summer heat. Seriously. It was so good I couldn't bear the thought of ruining it by having it iced. Come here and order the latte and enjoy the view (in ANY season). My friend's iced coffee, our board game, and my ""worth every drop of sweat"" epic hot latte.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"A friend introduced me to Alta's last year by virtue of a book club meeting. One would certainly never find it without a guide, trust me.  The first vibe I got was that it was Alta's was a laid back--dare I say borderline ""hippie-vibe""--establishment, with a small selection of edibles alongside wine, beer, coffee, smoothies, and other drinkables.  I really didn't think I'd be impressed because I was early for the book club, I was hungry, and it all looked like rabbit food.  I was so very lucky to go for the rabbit food as it turned out.  Normally I expect when I buy a boxed salad from a refrigerated case in a place like this that they'll just hand it over and you're left to your own devices.  But the ""barista"" added a really high touch.  I left with my wine, and she said she'd bring out the salad in a few minutes.  When it arrived, it looked nothing like the lonely salad I'd seen in the display.  It was presented on a large paper plate, fully dressed and fluffed.  Ultimately, it looked as delicious as it tasted.  OK, maybe she was actually salad fluffer and not a barista.  Yes, you can now add ""salad fluffer"" to your vocabulary.  That is, if it doesn't mean something nasty in Urban Dictionary.  The only real downer of the night--and this could be a biggie--was at the time I visited, there was work going on below for what appeared to be a City of Austin retention pond or sewerage project.  Either that, or they'd just dressed the grounds with sheep manure.  I'm going to assume that, based on the gorgeous deck, this is not a persistent problem and just a fluke on the night I visited.  But it was at least a distraction, possibly more, especially if you're trying to eat.  It smelled like a septic tank had backed up.  Also the bathrooms are a bit quirky.  They're outside of the establishment, which is OK since most of the seating is outside as well.  But, in order to use them, you have to go inside to get a code first, which can be a unnecessary delay if there's a line.  I understand why they do this, with the number of runners, rowers, and vagrants in the area, but it's just a little hassle.  I guess the good side of this is that the restrooms are well-maintained and not the nightmare they could be otherwise if controls weren't in place.  Hits: - Decent views of Lady Bird Lake - Fantastic staff and service - Food is quite good - Relaxing - Spotlessly clean  Misses: - Malodorous (on my visit, at least) - Limited lighting after dark  Definitely a place to kill an hour or two and chill.  I'll be back someday.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"2 check-ins Easily my favorite café in Austin.  Love the view.  Love the location.  Other than parking being a little difficult, I have nothing negative to say about this place.  Everything I've ordered off the menu has been exquisite.  While I wouldn't come here solely to eat, the café style food is still delish.  Mainly I come here to drink (which is my excuse to go to both places as I border alcoholism).  Their happy hour prices for wine are fantastic and they have a great selection.  They are generous on filling up your cup to the brim, but the even BETTER time to come here is on the first Saturday of the month.  On first Saturdays, enjoy live music and SIX DOLLAR BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS until 2pm.  Six. Dollars.  Easily the BEST priced mimosas in town.  And this champagne is not your cheap champagne like some places (ahem, The Park).  It has become my first Saturday ritual and I have brought any friend that likes mimosas and wants to have a lovely Saturday afternoon on the patio with a beautiful view.  Even their coffee drinks are fantastic.  This is a MUST GO place in Austin if you are visiting and would be a great location to take a gal on a super casual date.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"22 check-ins Supporting local businesses is very important to me. I work equidistant from Alta's Cafe and a Starbucks. I always go with Alta's and I'm never disappointed. Located right on Ladybird Lake, you're greeted with a friendly staff, a fantastic view, and ample seating outside on their deck. Did I mention Wi-fi? My co-worker and I frequent here late afternoons during the week when that 2:30 lull starts to creep in. The coffee is great, beer and wine is also available. There's some delicious healthy food options too. Nothing beats sitting on the water with a drink and a cheeseboard. Definitely one of Austin's best kept secrets when it comes to cafes.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Great location as it was a short walk from our hotel. Every 1st Saturday they have $8 bottomless mimosas and live music on the patio! Works for us! They have a small selection of hot items. We had the chicken pesto panini and bagel dog. Both were really satisfying! $8 bottomless mimosas with live music on this beautiful patio, 1st Saturday's of every month. Lucky us!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Got the cheese platter, iced vanilla chai, and GF muffin. All were great! And you can't beat the view of lady bird lake... Very relaxing.  Will be back on the next trip to Austin. We stayed at a nearby hotel so it was easy to walk to also! Ahhh",1
Coffee Shop 1,"The worst best coffee shop ever.  The deck at Alta looks over the water, and the view is really the only reason to come here. The view is amazing and Alta is right on the bike path. But the coffee shop itself is a disaster. The ambiance in the café is cold, service is off, the food is uninspired, and the setup just isn't customer friendly (the only sweetener on the coffee bar is stevia. Come on!)  But surely I'll be back to take a break from hot summer bike rides to look out over Town Lake. Alta being what it is, I might bring my own coffee next time.",0
Coffee Shop 1,"Came here while I was in town for a conference and went for a run on the lake. I conveniently ran into this place while I was looking for a breakfast spot and they had a nice view overlooking the lake.  It's a very peaceful spot to sit, especially if you're travelling alone and don't feel like being in a busy restaurant. Only reason I'm not giving it two stars is for the food. I got an everything bagel and it was well over salted and the smoothie was average for the price. To be fair, I went to a cafe and didn't order coffee so I'm probably not the best person to rate it as cafe food. Breakfast with a view",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Great stop!  Patio  perfect small menu.  Coffee and sustainable wine selections. They could use an additional employee at the lunch hour, but very good.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"This cafe is tucked at the Waller boathouse area. Park at the MACC center on Rainey street, the trail will take you straight to Alta's. I'm not too sure if they have free wifi.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Listed in Date Night: Austin, Ambiance in Austin Parking is horrible. Per their website- you can park on the top of the hill or at the Mexican American cultural center & it's a 5 minute walk. Hah. With all the construction around, good luck finding the MACC ... and finding street parking too.  Bathrooms- this pretty much ruined my first impression of this place. The men's restroom was out of order & the women's restroom was taken over by a kid with stomach issues. SO. They really need to fix bathrooms ASAP.  I can't speak for the food or drinks or prices since we came for a cider tasting event & Texas Keepers cider was pretty good & reasonably priced for a bottle.  But what I do love about this place:The view over the water. The bats at sunset. The patio & live music. Umbrellas up during the day to shade you from the Sun. If you can find parking & find a seat, you'll be in good hands.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"1) they lied about serving blue bottle coffee. 2) the girls who work here are dumb. I asked for a spinach and ricotta quiche. When it was ready she said ""your sundried tomato quiche is ready"" I told her I ordered the spinach one and she said ""oh, yeah it's the spinach one"". When I got back to my hotel and started eating it, it was no doubt the sundried tomato! Wtf... They just seem disconnected and inattentive the whole time. They don't seem like they do any work there....just hanging around. Gave me the wrong item even though I double checked with them. Servers are dumb",0
Coffee Shop 1,"The coffee I had here was average, the service was good, and the view was awesome.  I wouldn't recommend this place based on the bathroom situation, which is gross and unacceptable.    Alta, you sell a $15 cheese board, yet you only allow customers access to a hot, steamy, outdoor bathroom that smells like feces and has no soap?!  Yes,that's right no soap with which to wash my hands so I can eat my $15 cheese without getting nasty bathroom germs on my food.    For shame Alta, you need to get your bathroom situation figured out.  You must have an indoor bathroom for employees, I can't think of another place in Austin like you that relegates customers to the unmaintained toilet outside.  If you don't, I'll assume the people preparing  your food have some seriously nasty code-violating unwashed hands.",0
Coffee Shop 1,"My husband and I were walking around downtown on a Saturday and saw that this place was nearby. We wanted a little coffee on the lake before heading back home up north. The coffee was good but the service wasn't great. No one greeted us nor asked us if we needed any help or recommendations. Not a typical Austin experience. There were only 4 other customers there too. Maybe it's that it was a hot day and the crew wasn't into it, but we probably won't be back given all the other awesome and friendly coffee shops and bars in Austin. We tried!",0
Coffee Shop 1,"I strolled over to Alta's based on a recommendation from another business to check out.  I was able to go around sunset, order a lovely glass of sryah-cab blend, a cookie dough truffle, and sit out on the beautiful patio that overlooked a gorgeous body of water.  The rowing school below was closing up and cleaning their boats which was interesting and fun to watch and made me want to take up rowing or at least try it out sometime.  The individual who served me was a delight and suggested both items that I tried which were wonderful suggestions.  Definitely a nice spot to lounge, listen to music, and take in the scenery. My lovely view while chilling on the patio.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"What a gem. I almost don't want to write this review because I want to keep this place to myself.  Great coffee, definitely one of the better cappuccinos I've had in town. Nice patio and awesome view of the river, better than that of Mozart's in my opinion, quieter and less crowded too. They also offer smoothies, beer, and wine. Haven't tried their food yet but I am hopeful of its quality.  I'm surprised to see quite a few bad reviews for what I think are silly/unfair reasons: -  Because of parking: it's downtown, it's by the lake, it's going to be hard to find parking, but not more so than any other establishments in the same area. -  Because of slow service/small food menu: it's a coffee shop with a view and it's got a laid back vibe. It's not a great place for brunch or grabbing a quick cup of coffee with bagel, but it's a great place in it's own right.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I love this hidden coffeeshop near the river. The space is beautiful and connected with other organizations, the heater was on full blast and warm on a chilly day, and they have a great selection of local goods to pick from, including energy bars, East Side Pies, chips, and Blue Bottle, as well as a few taps.  The atmosphere is quiet, and the seating inside isn't exactly meant for large groups, making it a great place to study or work. I'm sure the patio is popular on beautiful days and overlooks a portion of the river (and at the moment, some construction). The bathrooms are outside of the coffeeshop and code-protected, but tidy.  It's right next to the trail that meets you at Trinity, which will take you down to Rainey and also to the portion that will bring you over the river to the Boardwalk--a great stop before or after a ride or run. The parking lot is small, but the location didn't seem to be too busy on a Saturday afternoon. I would love to return! Cashier/counter area",1
Coffee Shop 1,"2 check-ins Listed in austin. My favorite thing about this cafe is its location, overlooking the water. Two things about that:  1. That looks like a river to me. People keep referring to it as a lake, and I don't understand it because I'm 99% sure it's the Colorado River.  2. Get a new name for your river. Colorado deserves priority here because they also named their entire state after THEIR Colorado River. I don't appreciate having to specify which Colorado River I mean when I'm referring to rivers in the United States. Yes, it's all about me.  In any case, there's nothing not to like about Alta's. It's got free wi-fi, tasty smoothies (although I'm not sure if the Flu Fighter really fights the flu), pastries, Blue Bottle coffee, breakfast tacos (the Jess Special is what's good), and the aforementioned excellent view.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"5 stars for the patio and the view, 3 for the overall food and drink. If you're in downtown and can walk here, it's a great place to take in some sun and watch the rowers paddling by on the water.  The first Saturday's of the month they also have live music and endless mimosas (until 2pm when we went for around $7) which was a great way to spend the first part of our day with the parents visiting. Just go and relax and don't be in a hurry because no one seems to know exactly when the music is good to start :)",1
Coffee Shop 1,You pay something like $6 for a quiche that's tiny and doesn't taste very good. Not worth it. It's a great location but needs a better quiche.,0
Coffee Shop 1,It's cool. Don't want to type more. Go figure it out.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"10 check-ins Love, love, love this location. I adore the whole Waller Creek Boathouse movement by having a cafe, rowing company, kayaks, etc all within one building. The sheer convenience is an absolute win.  I have to eliminate a measly star for two reasons. Their Handsome Coffee brand in obscenely bitter. Also, you can't see the bats from this part of the trail. I recognize that's not their fault, but I've been told by different employees on different days that we could see the bats from their patio. Maybe a ploy to have another glass of wine? No, actually, that was probably my own ploy.  No matter. Because with those two minor exceptions, the staff is super nice and helpful. Their cheese boards are to die for. (Trust me. I WILL die for cheese). They have a great selection of wines and beer. Happy hour specials and deals are fantastic. The location is brilliant. It's off of Trinity, but I take the Lady Bird Trail. Yes, a coffee shop, happy hour, cheese board, pastry Mecca just off of the beaten path? People could only wish for that sort of convenience.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Alta's Cafe, you little minx. Where have you been hiding all my life? Tell me if any of this sounds enticing:  -- Gorgeous views of the lake/sunset -- Happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm, 7 days a week -- Easy parking -- $5 bottomless mimosas on the first Sat of every month -- Easy Tiger bread, Henri's Cheese  Yeah. Altas pretty much fulfills all of your Austin fantasies. We enjoyed sweet breezes on the patio while eating fantastic pressed panini sandwiches, drinking an inexpensive bottle of Sauv Blanc and some craft beers and waiting for the sun to go down.  Just park at the Mexican American Cultural Center and walk over. It's about a three minute walk to a little slice of Austin awesomeness. Great wine specials See all photos from Kelly S. for Alta's Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 1,Tried their iced peach tea on a hot summer day overlooking the river. Can't get much better than that.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"A great way to spend a day by Town Lake while getting your rear in ever so fit gear by rowing to your heart's content at Ro Fitness next door and celebrating those burned calories and newly toned muscles with a post-workout food and smoothie nirvana that at Alta's Cafe! The wonderful staff was very accommodating and can recommend some of their sammich action (so many delicious options!) or try their gluten-free zucchini bread which is guilt-free oh so gooood, or go the sin-city route with one of their hot & fresh Snickerdoodles. For me, I had one of the best smoothies that has ever had the pleasure of gracing my tastebuds! I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, but it is purple, peanut buttery, and fantastically healthy & delicious!!  They also serve beer and wine, so if you don't want an endorphin rush from exercise around the Town Lake trails, you can just sit and chill overlooking town lake with a cool brewskie or a glass of fine wine.  Either way, a great way to Sunday Funday it up any day of the week!  Fair warning, parking is super scarce and all metered/street, especially on weekends! Excellent vino options!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"We were in a rush, but the coffee was great, the barista knew what she was doing, and the view was great. Park at the MACC, there is a shortcut path at the west end of the parking lot. The breakfast burritos were pre prepared, but we went back for seconds, hot sauce was not too hot but really good!! Menu",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Limited inside seating; patio is nice and large, but the clientele out there was loud. The coffee is Sightglass, not Blue Bottle like they claim basically everywhere (even on the signs at the end of Trinity pointing to the cafe), but hey, Sightglass is cool too. (Note to mgmt: +1 star if you say it like it is.)  Best part is they're open for +2 hours after the other downtown options (Medici and Houndstooth)",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Nice place, great service, all ages crowd. View. Their bread is local and fresh, on simple paper plate, basic and yummy. Super nice location Asked for a sandwich and a side salad, simplicity at its best",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I love this adorable, peaceful little coffeeshop on the river. I usually go for wine or smoothies, but the food looks awesome and everyone who works there is so nice. I don't really know why other people are making a big deal about the parking--you park on the street just like at any other place downtown, or you can park at the Mexican American Cultural Center and take an absolutely beautiful, short stroll down the river trail to the cafe. It's a feature, not a bug!  My favorite smoothie is the one with coffee. Add raw cacao to jazz it up. Then sit and watch the sun set and the bats fly out from the bridge. It's a super special spot!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"6 check-ins I have been anticipating the opening of this spot, and it is EVERYTHING I had hoped for.  It reminds me of the casual boating lake cafes in Switzerland.  You can enjoy a casual glass of wine with a meat and cheese plate out on the deck overlooking the water, or an awesome strong espresso (served correctly with sparkling water!) and a pastry.  The coffee is handsome coffee.  It is strong quality coffee, so if you don't like strong coffee, you won't like this.  The owner is super friendly and informative.  You just get your order at the counter, and then it is brought out to you when done.  The owner hand cuts the meat and prepares the plates for you.  They also have a small selection of bottled beers for those who don't like wine.  They also serve up some smoothies and tea (which I haven't tried yet).  Another bonus is that they have a wide selection of GOOD gluten free pastries brought in from some local bakeries.  The zucchini bread was delicious and moist...I couldn't believe it was gluten free.  I think I just found my new dream hang out spot.  I forgot to mention they have free WI-FI!! Great relaxed and casual outdoor seating area Great outdoor seating area overlooking the water Handsome Coffee = Yummy See all photos from Mindy H. for Alta's Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Does it get anymore Austin than to have a coffee shop at the boathouse?  This newly constructed, bright and airy space features high ceilings and large windows facing the river. There are three tables for indoor seating and about three times that on a deck facing the river. In the morning, the rowers skim past. I enjoyed a nicely made whole milk latte and a gluten free blueberry muffin. They have a menu of food labeled ""sustainably focused, locally sourced.""  (My muffin was indeed from an Austin bakery.). The wine menu features many by the glass. The music is quiet and unobtrusive, almost spa-like.  The river location is truly beautiful. A special compliment to the young man working the counter--he was very warmly friendly and relaxed. His energy really fit the vibe of this place. Lots of blueberries in the gluten free muffin Lovely latte art",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Yuck. the food is overpriced and the croissant I had was stale. Coffee was good, but it seems they are no longer contracted with Blue Bottle anymore.  it also appears that they have a high turnover rate or that they don't treat their workers with respect... I was there and this woman had been waiting for an interview for over 40 minutes. Apparently the manager had forgotten about the interview, and what's bothersome is that  the current employees  treated it as a usual thing that the manager does.  As a worker/manager in the restaurant industry for the past 15 years, I find it degrading and unacceptable to treat your employees or future employees in such a poor manner. They are people and they deserve respect.",0
Coffee Shop 1,"One of the only coffee shops with a water view! Laid back, casual place to grab one of their delicious raspberry scones & a coffee. Nice & quiet on weekdays if you want to get some work done. Very limited seating inside & plenty of seating outside overlooking Lady Bird Lake from a perch! Nothin' fancy but it does the trick!! Light, bright & airy with a view",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I love Alta's Cafe for so many reasons. Let me break it down for you.  Coffee- They're the first coffee shop in Austin to serve Blue Bottle coffee, and it's incredible. Their cortado is, by far, the best in Austin.  Food- They source their ingredients locally (milk, veggies, chocolate, bread, you name it!) Everything is so good; they have incredible smoothies, sandwiches, quiche, and other delicious pastries.  Location- The cafe is right on Lady Bird Lake, so you can sit outside on the sprawling deck, drink your latte, read the paper, & have a gorgeous view.  Booze- They have an impressive selection of beer, wine & cider. Check out their happy hour that runs daily from 4-6pm for $1 off all beer & $2 off all wine.  Peace- This is a place that hasn't been discovered by the masses, so it's a great place to go when you want to catch up with a friend, get some work done, or read a good book.  Check it out and see for yourself! Soy cappuccino",1
Coffee Shop 1,Located right off of the hike and bike trail I've passed this place quite a few times without pokinng my head in. Rectified that a little while ago and wasn't disappointed. Sandwiches and healthy blended drinks can be enjoyed on the patio out back overlooking the river. This is a nice spot to chill and watch the sun set after a bike ride or jog. Pet friendly patio with a clean restroom. Yaay a restroom!,1
Coffee Shop 1,"The food is a bit pricey for what you get, but the rockstar bagel dogs are tasty and only $4.50. They have a lot of options for wine, and offer a nice selection of coffee. The view is the real winner for this place. View of the lake",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I agree with Will W., I don't want to give away the secret because this place is not very large but you are going to find out anyway. The Tacos are interestings and delicious. The champagne they use to make mimosa's is good. The Wine list is 2 Legit 2 Quit - Hey Hey. They have great coffee and source locally when possible. They have happy hour specials. It's a nice casual place for a first date. Follow Trinity until it dead ends into the river. Ride your bike or walk because parking looks scarce. The crowd is full of people who enjoy the hike and bike trail and their dogs.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Loved this place. You can study, work, or just relax here. Customer service is awesome and baristas will even suggest drinks. There are even beer buckets! I can't wait to bring my friends here. I had originally come to get some work done. Great ambiance and atmosphere. Even liked the music! I was singing along at times!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"The food here is an absolute JOKE. I got the beet and goat cheese sandwich that was nearly 10 dollars. It took them 45 minutes to bring out stale baguette with a slab of spreadable goat cheese and a couple beets that were cubed, not sliced to fit on a sandwich causing the entire experience of eating the thing to be nearly impossible.  This place takes advantage of the location being on the water, which is nice... But if you are actually hungry--- go somewhere else where you won't leave feeling price gauged, sad and hungry.",0
Coffee Shop 1,"Really nice barista, love the patio over the lake.  Had a great latte and mocha.  I bet this'd be a cool spot to bat watch, haven't tried it yet though.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Alta's Cafe is a hidden gym tucked away behind part of the town lake hiking trail.  I had passed by this place many times but never stopped by because it is a bit tucked away so I wasn't even sure it was a restaurant! I had their house iced black tea, and my brother had a iced latte with a caesar salad.  He LOVED his coffee and I tried a bit of his salad----delicious! The food seems to be responsibly raised/farmed, as they have plenty of organic options.  They also serve wine and beer.  This is a great place for a quick pit stop during a morning run (they have breakfast tacos, too!).  The view is gorgeous, and there were several tables available on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. You will have to find parking on the street or somewhere along the trail, but the walk will be a pretty one!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Listed in Happy Hour Hoppin', Of All The Coffee Houses In The World... Alta's wins the ""coffee shop on the lake"" game. Their is some construction going on right now on their end of the lake, so their is *some* obstruction to their otherwise five star view.  I love coming here around sunset (otherwise it can get too hot on the patio if they don't have all the umbrellas out) because you can get a direct, amazing view of the sun setting. They have a decent amount of outlets outside (which is a rarity for patios), and their seating is SO comfy. SO comfy. They have a mix of high tables to picnic tables to these cool little egg shaped chairs.  Happy hour from 5:30-7:30, 7 days a week, and it isn't difficult for friends driving to meet you up as they can park at the Mexican Am Cultural Center and walk over. Their service is also FANTASTIC! I love the guy behind the counter - once I find out his name I'll update this review - but he is the nicest. Always asks about your day and whatnot, gush.  There's also a rowing class next door, so it's always a little fun to sit with your happy hour and watch the class, ha!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"ROTD I'm always lamenting Austin's lack of lake-side cafes. Why can't there be more places to enjoy the view, hang out with your tourist friends, and legally sip wine? My count usually goes: Hula Hut (hmmmmm), Mozart's (hmmmmm), the Four Seasons, and um, what else? Now there's an answer: Alta's  Ok, yes, the ""view"" includes the Waller Creek tunnel project construction, but that will be done soon, and then it's all lake and trail and hello trail people. The cafe balcony is perched up on the second floor, meaning you can just let the world go along its merry way. They have several bottle of wine, 6 beers on tap, larger format beer bottles, really good snickerdoodle cookies, coffee, smoothies (the power10 was delicious, made a believer out of this peanut butter hater), and sandwiches. What else do you want  for a few moments out on the lake?  Seriously, get style points. Take your friends for a walk around the lake, then casually mention that it's happy hour. Done.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"2 check-ins -Nice view of the lake -Daily happy hour with $2 off wine, $1 off beer (4-6:30) -Antonelli's cheese -Decent smoothies -Big, outdoor patio with umbrellas -Metered parking has been surprisingly easy to find nearby",1
Coffee Shop 1,"First to Review Located on the outside deck of the Waller Creek Boathouse next to the Rainey St. district, this cafe (currently open only on weekends until they get a full liquor license or something?) serves up breakfast tacos, sandwiches, coffee, tea, and wine.  (There's beer, mimosas, and other refreshments available as well.)  Exercise enthusiasts passing by on the hike and bike trail can stop by for a quick pick-me-up before continuing on their way.  There are tables and chairs set up inside the boathouse atrium and outside on the deck, and the view of the lake is gorgeous.  (It'll also improve once the city's construction for the Waller Creek outflow retention lagoon is done.)  My favorite breakfast taco is the avocado, bacon, and egg.  As a member of the Austin Rowing Club co-located at the Waller Creek Boathouse, I guess that means I can punish and treat myself at the same place now...",1
Coffee Shop 1,I've ran by this place many times when running the trail and wondered what it was like. I took my daughter and wife for an early lunch on a beautiful day.  The food was excellent!  Loved the atmosphere and will definitely be returning here again.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"FIVE star view and looks like a great place to put in a coffeehouse no beer house no wine garden no fresh bakery (no,really plastic wrapped fresh days ago bakery) .  Great view of the lake with ZERO parking  It's kind of like the 18th hole grill on the golf course,not offering much in general but we're always happy they have bathrooms and beverages. no dog park,gym,hang out for rowers",0
Coffee Shop 1,Great spot for a quiet Sunday morning Kombucha,1
Coffee Shop 1,"2 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost, Austin Go To's As far as coffee shops are concerned, Alta's is literally a hidden gem in Austin. There's a number of great things about this place:  1. Pretty quiet, both inside and outside. Music isn't very loud indoors, and outside, there might be construction going on, but it's a calm area. 2. Aesthetically pleasing. Alta's design is clean, simple, and relaxing to the eye (I love all of the blue...). There's a great view of the lake as well (however..the construction does put a damper on that). 3. Reasonably priced coffee that's tasty. They've got a good cold brew. I'm curious as to what their pour over tastes like (done via Kalita Wave), especially with the Handsome Coffee they use from L.A. 4. I didn't get food this time, but they have a great menu! They've got a bunch of locally sourced products (i.e. Rockstar & Antonelli's) as well. 5. Plenty of seating, mostly outdoors. Great for big groups too.  Greatest con is the parking. It's paid, and there isn't a lot of it nearby. Unfortunately, this hinders me from making Alta's one of my top favorites in Austin, but it's pretty high up there. I'm definitely returning. I look forward to a pour over and a meal during my next visit!  Note: I can't comment on the speed of the wi-fi, as I didn't use it while I was there.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"12 check-ins Really love this place. It's a walk to, as there is no parking which is fine for us. Right over the boat house, so after a kayak it's a great stop for lunch and a beer.

Coffee Shop 1,This a nice little spot along the river! I haram an Americans and it's really good! They have a lot of milk/creamer choices as well. They make some good sounding espresso beer floats as well!,1
Coffee Shop 1,Convenient. Nice employees. But a little over-priced and slow if you're not chilling & enjoying the view which is what Alta's is all about,1
Coffee Shop 1,This is a gem in rough! Stumbled upon this place on a walk around the lake. Its amazing! Great wine selection and cheese and a great view of the lake. Its quiet and relaxing! I am so glad I found this place!,1
Coffee Shop 1,"Such a cluster. There are way too many tables for what they are able to competently accommodate.  Cut the number of tables in half, double the staff, triple the amount of brunch food on hand (they were out at 11), and this place MIGHT be okay.  If you're okay with waiting 20 minutes for your bagel, then this place is for you! Otherwise, a 2-hour wait is better spent for someplace on Rainey street.",0
Coffee Shop 1,This place is just for the view. Food is mediocre and selection on wines are not that great and funniest thing I heard was thOne good thing is they have Blue Bottle Coffee.,0
Coffee Shop 1,"Alta's Cafe combines all of Austin's favorite things--single origin coffee, craft beers, the lake, and for the extreme Austinite, rowing. Scenery and limited parking (thus leading to limited number of people at once) are icing on the cake. If you get here at 7AM, you might be the only one in the shop, with free parking.  As a revenue worry, the question underlying my concern is ""how will they get enough traffic to stay afloat?"" At $10 a transaction for a beverage and a snack, surely the income must be bolstered by the Rowing Center.  Their groceries, wine, and food options are reminiscent of an eclectic convenience store: East Side Pies, baked goods from assorted bakeries, and a decent wine selection.  The concept really does push the ticket--what is the most obscure place Austin could place a quality pub/coffee shop? Rowing docks, boutique bicycle shops, food trucks, inside boutique retailers... what's next?",1
Coffee Shop 1,"The food here is simply okay. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and lox. As a native New Yorker, I expect generous amounts of cream cheese with my bagel, but that wasn't the case at Alta's. The greek salad with chicken also looked (and tasted) very uninspiring. I would come back for their smoothies, muffins, views and free wifi. FYI: There is no available parking on site so I had to pay to park down the street. It cost $1/hr.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Super cute place. The followed me on Twitter and I was actually just looking for a cafe type of place that I could go to on the lake (besides my usual fave Mozart's) AND with an organic selection of food and variety in drinks. I only had the organic peanut butter & jelly sandwich which was good but I'd like to go back for their happy hour. The only negatives was that parking is hard to find (had to park on Rainey St. and cut through on a trail but that was actually really lovely in itself) and the outdoor seating is great but construction is going on which takes away from the view. Once that is finished, though, I'm sure this will be a perfect little place!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Updated review We stopped here after a vigorous walk along the river.  Many good choices... my husband had a chai tea latte with hazel nut milk.  I had an iced coffee and a beet and goat cheese sandwich on a crunchy (sourdough?)  roll.  It was devine, but I obviously love beets.  It came with potato chips.  Everything was fresh and organic.  We sat in the patio overlooking the river.  Love this place!!",1
Coffee Shop 1,This place is nice. The patio right on the river was a great place to sit and people watch. The coffee is good. Good friendly service too.,1
Coffee Shop 1,Nice coffee shop with a good view. Geared towards people walking the trail or who row. I wouldn't go here with the intention of sitting to get a lot of work done but if I were in the area and wanted a cup to go I would come here again.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"Great place to grab a coffee, beer, wine or a snack",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I was staying in a hotel downtown and made the short walk to Alta's for a morning cup of joe. There is construction next door, but the noise was minimal and the view will be even better once work is completed. Enjoy the beautiful river view. The coffee I had was exceptionally strong. They have scones!  Lots of active people stage here before or after bike riding, running or sculling.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"What a cute location! Enjoyed a coffee here with my friend, we grabbed and ran, but the view is amazing. Definitely recommend checking it out.  Parking was a challenge. Maybe I missed where we were supposed to park? But I saw no parking anywhere...",1
Coffee Shop 1,The view.  The atmosphere.  The strong cappuccino.  We loved it all. The owner even replaced our cappuccinos when we accidentally poured stevia in our drinks.  Whew!  Way too sweet  Caution: The quiche is addictive. Yes recommended.   Good for casual dates.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"I loved Alta's Cafe. I spent over three hours here drinking, eating and enjoying their patio. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced. The view of the river makes for a great ambiance as well. Highly recommended!",1
Coffee Shop 1,Stopped off at the dock nearby while out on the lake and walked up for a couple drinks.  Punching in the numbers from my credit card (I have it memorized) was no problem as I also didn't have any cash.  Good selection of drinks and a great patio to enjoy for a quick break.  Will definitely stop in again next time I'm out on the lake.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"We were walking along the river when we stumbled upon this jewel. Awesome little cafe that serves organic and sustainable coffee, wine and beers. I have both gluten and dairy allergies and was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered a variety of milk alternatives for their coffees and smoothies (more than just soy) which rarely happens. They even had a nice selection of gluten free pastries which looked delicious. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful weather as we looked out on the river. The atmosphere was so enjoyable we ended up staying for several hours and multiple beverages. Would definitely come again and recommend it to others! Great atmosphere, delicious drinks and Eco friendly",1
Coffee Shop 1,Currently eating one of the best cookies of my life. Double chocolate oatmeal w walnut. The coffee here is delicious as well. Their scones are not dry but filled with juicy peaches. The view is matched only by Mozart's. Will be better once this construction is done.  Clean and well designed. Love this place. Baby-friendly.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"Stumbled upon this during SXSW. Blue Bottle Coffee, you say? I'm there. So glad to have found this and know that I can purchase Blue Bottle locally now, instead of ordering online from SF. Yay Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Hidden gem, great lake view, right off the running path, good beer and wine selection, great patio.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"This might be the worst, most overpriced coffee I've ever had in my life.  They didn't even have real sugar out and I had to ask for cream.  My friend and I got coffee here, and it was so shockingly terrible we had to thow it out as we walked around.  Thankfully, Medici Cafe was nearby to save us.  Don't go here for coffee.  Not to mention all the rich snobby people hanging about in their rowing gear trying really hard to speak without a Texas accent.",0
Coffee Shop 1,This has got to be the definition of a hidden gem. Such a great place to sit along the river on a beautiful day.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"If you care at all about getting friendly and somewhat fast service, then this place is not for you.  The girl at the counter taking orders was obnoxious.  Standard default 15% tip on the ipad of course (dude!  can i tip you negative 15%???).  Then after being rude, she tells us to go sit down with our number on the table and they will bring us ""everything"" at once.  After 20 min, we're thinking how long can coffee and shakes take?  Turns out the coffee was just sitting on the counter getting cold.  And they pretty much forgot about the sandwiches we suspect b/c the 2nd girl asked what else we ordered other than the drinks.  She was at least friendly about it though so I""ll give her credit.    Drinks and food were maybe average.  Nice spot to sit on the deck, but not sure it's worth it if you're going to order anything other than a drip coffee.  Anything more complicated and you better be patient , and not care about the rude girl taking your order.  I think we spent about $70 for several people, so it's not like the place is cheap either.  Probably would rather go sit outside at Trio if we want to drop the $",0
Coffee Shop 1,"Great place to go with a group or date. Excellent wine, food and service. The cafe has tons of out door seating and over looks the lake. Great wine, coffee & food - top it all off you're over looking the lake. My new fav!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"This place has everything you could want.  Amazing lakeside view and great ambiance.  Staff is friendly and fun.  No doubt some of the best coffee in the whole city, if not the best.  Seriously, not kidding on this one, they know their coffee.  They are artists in their food prep too.  Definitely recommend!",1
Coffee Shop 1,2 check-ins Small little cafe overlooking Lady Bird Lake. Great gluten free options from a local bakery and the smoothies are filling and delicious. Come here for a pot of tea or a warm beverage during the winter or a glass of wine on a patio at night. The only noticeable downside is the limited seating inside.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"A beautiful spot for coffee. I like to come here after a run or long walk on the trail. They have a fantastic vanilla syrup that they make in house. So great in a vanilla latte. They also serve breakfast tacos. I have never ordered their food (salads, sandwiches, etc) because it seems overpriced. Friendly staff!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"I'd walked this section of the trail before, but it'd clearly been a while as I had no idea that the Waller Creek Boat House and this cafe even existed. My better half dragged my heir and me down here for a ""rowing demo"" since it was National Rowing Day. I'm expecting to watch a demonstration, much as one would view an air show or perhaps a guy karate-chopping cinder blocks on National Karate Day. But, no such luck, says me, as we ended up on the lake in an 8-person shell, flailing madly with a a heavy oar, sweating profusely and fearing for my life in the event of capsizing. With that dreadful experience in the rearview, all I wanted was some air conditioning and a cold drink. Alta's delivered in spades. Their incredibly friendly staff, unmatched lakeside seating and custom-steeped ice tea that tasted like a mouthful of flowers (in a good way, not like that time I woke up with a prom corsage blocking my airway...story for another time) combined for a VERY pleasant experience. In the words of the (not technically) immortal Douglas MacArthur, I will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Great place, hidden gem for sure if you don't see it from town lake. Good coffee/drink selection, dog friendly, live music and RIGHT NEXT TO THE LAKE, DOWNTOWN!",1
Coffee Shop 1,"Alta's Cafe is really a great little place tucked away at the boathouse.  I row a few days of the week and I always wanted to enjoy the deck with coffee but never had the chance because the closest coffee shop was not great. I never wanted to spoil a good morning with bad coffee. Now that Alta's is here the game has changed.  Not only do they have GREAT coffee selections (usually one local one from CA) but they also have breakfast burritos, regular and gluten free pastries and other goodies for the athlete or the casual dock sitter.  They plan on being there all week long, instead of just the weekends as they are now, soon. I'm really looking forward to that day. And they plan to have some indoor space soon as well which will be great for when there are those really HOT summer days in Austin.  EDIT UPDATE: I used to love this place, as seen above. But their prices went up and I've had coffee there that was so bitter it curdled the milk. They did replace the coffee but it hasn't been the same.",0
Coffee Shop 1,Very nice little cafe with friendly service and good seating on the deck overlooking the lake. I had a grilled turkey sandwich with arugula and a piña colada smoothie. Both were delicious. They also have some great local beers on tap. It's a little over priced but that's the only drawback for a great little hangout after a long walk/run on the trail.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"Friendly service, excellent coffee and cold brew, and a great view of the River.  Outside will be especially amazing once they complete the Waller Creek Tunnel project - almost  done!",1
Coffee Shop 1,Lovely outdoor seating setup for some solid on-the-river work. I had one of their vegetable smoothies too and it was quite tasty.,1
Coffee Shop 1,"When we first walked up to Alta's, we thought it was closed.  That's what the sign inside the glass doors said, anyway.  Then we realized that we were supposed to walk around the outside of the building to the tent and order there.  Got some decent beers and a nice wine from the kid working there, who had just moved to town the previous month.  He was pleasant, and we enjoyed the view of the lake, the shade of the building, and the fresh breezes.    Supposedly, they are going to build out the interior of the building in the coming months so that Alta's has a more permanent setup.  For now, their tent seems to be working fine.

Coffee Shop 64,"Did Manti Te'o open up a gelato place in Texas??  On gamedays, maybe his girlfriend runs the shop.  And maybe he rides in on his unicorn.  Catfishing jokes aside, this place is pretty cool.  It was a little bit out of the way from where we were staying, but since we went to Blacks BBQ, we were in the neighborhood.  It was a nice way to finish the good meal we had at Blacks.  Both of my daughters went with the Strawberry, while I went with the Salted Caramel and Cookies And Cream.  My choices were very good and ""reeked"" of FRESHNESS!  I'm not a fan of fruit in ice cream or gelato, but the Strawberry version was pretty good, as well.  The service could've been more enthusiastic and friendly, but it wasn't rude.  The tables were clean and there was a bunch of parking outside (although, on weekends and other peak times, it might be a little harder). Salted Caramel and Cookies And Cream",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Extremely tasty gelato, generous scoop sizes, and a wide variety of flavors. What more could you ask for?  I've only visited once, but after my experience, I am sure I will be returning. The staff was extremely kind and helpful, and they were really patient with letting me sample and debate over the flavors I wanted. I ended up with chocolate oreo and some stolen licks of my boyfriend's mint oreo, and was pretty thrilled with both.  They also have a good amount of sorbetto flavors, denoted  by the green handles on their scoopers. My only wish was that some of these fruity flavors really were a creamy gelato instead of an icy sorbetto, but I know most gelato shops default flavors such as lemon to sorbetto (and I still think it is a nice surprise when they don't).",1
Coffee Shop 64,"2 check-ins It's been decided. Teo is my favorite gelato place in Austin. I can honestly rave on and on about how good this place is, but I'll try to keep my list short... :)  -ALWAYS fresh and the perfect temperature! Note that gelato tends to melt more quickly than ice cream -Endless flavors to choose from. Each one is so unique, intense, and incomparable -A couple sorbet flavors available as well -GENEROUS amount! Get the Medium sized cup. It's like a 40 cent difference and you get so much more! -Service is the best ever. They're always suggesting good combinations of flavors to sample and pick and choose from -Spacious enough for groups, indoors & outdoors -Great location! Parking is always available  FLAVOR SUGGESTIONS: -Italian Peanut Butter (previously named Nuts - won HEB flavor award) -Pumpkin Pie (seasonal) -Bourbon Vanilla -Mi Amore (not as thicker version of Nuts) -Pistachio (seasonal) Medium (up to 3 flavors) Pistachio, Italian peanut butter",1
Coffee Shop 64,Can't give full 5 stars because I have had better gelato ... but TEO taste GREAT! I got the medium size which can hold up to 3 flavors. I got double Oreo Coffee and one of the Mixed Forest Fruits. They worker that served us was very nice and let us try a lot of the flavors. I felt bad because we asked to taste almost everything! The gelato is very creamy but it was a little way too sweet. I definitely needed some water after. Price range was not too bad. Definitely recommend if you want a quick and cheap dessert. Their parking area is a little crowded.  Apparently they won a gelato contest! I thought that was pretty cool :)  I haven't tried their coffee yet. I think I would come back here and definitely get more of that mixed fruits flavor :) Medium. 3 flavors. About $4,1
Coffee Shop 64,"8 check-ins I really really like it here- for many good reasons!  Location/ Atmosphere: Clean and casual location. It's easy for desserts locations to get sticky and dirty tables- but I've never experienced that here. Parking is always easy to find- which is rare for anywhere in Austin but that's part of what keeps bringing me back! There's plenty of seating inside, limited number outside.  Flavors: They have a lot to choose from- both dairy and sorbet! I personally really like their Lemon flavor and my sister really likes the Pineapple. She even bought a small tub of it for $10.99 to take home even though it is on the pricier side than most tubs of gelato. A lot of the flavors are a definite summer must :"")  Service: People here are kind and they're happy to let you try the flavors before you choose! My sister and I always share a Large cup (4 flavors for ~$6) and were a little disappointed when the guy behind the counter buried one of the flavors to the bottom of the cup. We had to dig our entire cup down to find it and didn't really get to enjoy all four flavors properly because it melted and got mixed in with the other three. Won't keep me from coming but when we asked him his response was a little too indifferent- I had to knock down a star.  Overall, pretty solid location. I'd check out the HEB location where they sell their delicious gelato in tubs too! We were feeling fruity :"") Cinnamon, Pink Lemonade, Vanilla Bean, and Cherry Vanilla Exotic fruit & lemon See all photos from Erin A. for Teo",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Craving an iced latte, I stopped in here for the first time Sunday evening around 6:30. I assumed because it was 1. a Sunday night and 2. UT game day that it would be super quiet and easy to get in and out of; I was wrong. Here's the thing - I can't fault them for being busy, or the fact that there were 4 screaming kids, or the fact that the family in front of me sampled 10 flavors each. I can't even blame them for only having 2 employees, since I'm sure those employees weren't pleased about it either.  But I can fault them for being generally unpleasant and rude. After the family of (literally) 12 people got through the line, I asked the guy behind the counter what flavors they had for lattes. The syrup list isn't posted anywhere - not online, not on the menu in the store, I looked. He referred me to the other employee, who looked at me like I was a total idiot. He rattled off a few, looking irritated. Then,""there's a lot."" Silence. ?!??!?!? Sorry to inconvenience you, dude.  I worked in food service for many years. I know how frustrating bad customers can be (and the family in front of me were definitely annoying). But, when you move on to the next group of people, try to let it go.  One star for the latte. It's really great. I don't see a reason to come back.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Of all the trendy ice cream/gelato places in Austin this place is a winner. The decor and atmosphere  are nice, but don't expect anything sophisticated or hip. They keep it simple and the product speak for itself. Loved the salted caramel, pistachio and strawberry.  For some reason everything is sweeter in America, but I loved the flavors and textures and most of all the total absence of hipsters. Great parking also. I'll sure come back.

Coffee Shop 64,"This gelato is incredible. All their flavors are delicious and unique, my favorite being the peanut butter Nutella. I could eat this gelato every day. Highly recommend. Peanut butter Nutella and coffee oreo So so good",1
Coffee Shop 64,"I have a weakness for sweet things. So much so, that I think it's my favorite food in the whole world is gelato/ ice cream. I remember eating countless tubs of store bought ice cream that had fancy names, good reviews. I tried all hip and trendy places to lick my favorite treat. All are are just echoes in my mind now - ""Tèo you are the real thing. Other ice cream / gelato makers - please get your act together!' I'm seriously impressed with how Tèo manages to use less ingredients and delivers more.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"2 check-ins My favorite gelato place in Austin!  4 stars only because it breaks my wallet to come here, but the flavors are oh so good. You can ask to try anything and nobody will judge you. I usually go for some sort of variation of salted caramel/coffee/toffee/vanilla. The texture is perfect, creamy with no fatty aftertaste. Rich but not too thick. Yum! Plus they have a sign that says gelato is healthier than ice cream that will soothe your conscience even if you decide on buying the largest size.  Their coffee is not memorable: come for the gelato!",1
Coffee Shop 64,"3 check-ins Teo has quite a few good things going for it: good selection of flavors for every palate, an ample parking lot, a spacious interior, and coffee that sounds good (haven't tried it so can't make any promises).  I got a small cup with strawberry chocolate chip and fruits of the forest, and they were delicious. The small cup looks abysmally tiny, but they fill it up well so it's enough to satisfy without feeling gluttonous. I very much enjoyed my gelato, though truth be told it's it's hard for me not to like an ice cream or gelato place. I didn't think it was as rich or thick as other gelatos I've had, not that it's necessarily a good or bad thing. It is on the pricier side though - I would say it's close to a dollar more for comparable items at most other ice cream/gelato places I've seen. I'd certainly come back to try more flavors, but not all that often so as to not break the bank!",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Plenty of flavors to choose from here, all of which you can try. Our server was genuine and friendly (came on the night of the 20th so shout outs to him). Decor of this place is nice and quaint. Parking wasn't too bad as there's a lot outside of the store. I really liked the fake fire place outside and sitting there was nice.  The seats were unfortunately rather dirty though, and I didn't notice it until my friend noticed my pants had these weird stains on the outside...yes, now-dried gelato, so I encourage y'all to keep the tables and seats cleaner outside.  Now, onto the taste of the gelato. I can really only compare this to Dulce Neve since their quality is around the same level.  Honey Bourbon and the Coffee Oreo thing is the way to go here...well, that was the combination recommended to us by the server. I'm sure there are more combos out there but this one was rather spot on. It tastes exactly like you would think, except the bourbon is extremely light and adds moreso of a finisher than an equal counterpart to the taste of the coffee oreo.  Now in comparison to Dulce Neve, assuming you've been there, the first thing you'll notice is that it seems that this place's gelato is a LOT less THICK. It almost made me think of it as ice cream... but of course that's a sin for gelato lovers right? ;} Personally, I still prefer Dulce Neve over this place, but I still encourage everyone to come try this place too so you can compare it yourself.  Also, the pricing did seem a tad bit more expensive here, but not that far off from Dulce Neve's.  8/10, would definitely come again. Honey bourbon coffee oreo large",1
Coffee Shop 64,"4 check-ins Listed in Just A Spoonful of Sugar, Ice Cream, Gelato, and Shaved Ice! Teo is a good gelato place for those who want more options in the sorbetto category. They offer a good balance of tart fruit flavors and sweet creamy flavors, so you're sure to find something that'll satisfy everyone's cravings.  I really enjoy their mango flavor! Tastes just like mangoes and so refreshing on a summer day. The Exotic Fruits flavor is really good too!  They do rotate their flavors occasionally to change things up. :) I also heard they sell their pints of gelato at the Westlake HEB :o",1
Coffee Shop 64,"This review is not for their ice cream but for their service. Unfortunately, if you're in a service industry, even if your product is award winning, if you are too insolent to value your customer's time, those customers won't be coming back.  I visited Teo last week. I patiently waited in line until the customer in front of me is done. After he left, I was completely ignored. The cashier and the server started chatting while I was waiting.  I don't know what was so urgent but whatever they were talking about was obviously more important than their customer. After 10 minutes I gave up and left. They realized their mistake and apologized as soon as I stepped outside but it was already too late.  I can live without Teo's ice cream.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"This is a hard one. The gelato is excellent yet there aren't enough varieties and very little tart flavors or berries on that menu. The coffee is superb. My issue is that the owner is so unfriendly and usually has a sour puss face it's a turn off. If you go to a local business, repeatedly you'd expect a 'hello' or some type of salutation. No way Jose.  They have on again off again issues with their wifi so working here is not optimal. The atmosphere is utilitarian so better to order and take it away then leave.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"2 check-ins Teo is one of our favorite spots for dessert when we are in this part of Austin.  They have a wide variety of delectable gelato flavors.  Some of my favorites are their mango, mocha, and mexican vanilla.  The most disappointing part of going to Teo, is having to narrow down your selection because there is so much to choose from.  I typically get the medium size because you can get up to three flavors, creating your own gelato Neapolitan treat.  If you are also a coffee connessour, they also have an espresso machine.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Amazing gelato. Terrible service.  Yes, their gelato is THAT good. Yes, service is THAT bad. Rude, disgruntled owner. Extremely slow, inefficient employees.  Service is so slow that I have finished my large cup of gelato while waiting in line to pay for it. Employees don't care if you are waiting.  I just don't understand why???  This kind of gelato + great service = take my $$  Shitty service ruins everything. After giving several benefits of doubt, I am not inclined to come back.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"In searching for a new ice cream spot, I came across Teo Gelato.  The staff is super friendly and will let you try as many flavors as you'd like. I ended up getting coconut nutella and peanut butter nutella (Nuts) which were to die for!!  Parking was easy and there were plenty of spots to sit.  I would agree with a few of the other reviewers in that none of the prices up on the menu board are listed which is a little odd. Customers would really appreciate having the prices posted on menus.  This might not be the newest or trendiest places, but it was cute, convenient and most importantly tasty! Coconut Nutella & Nuts",1
Coffee Shop 64,"I work nearby and frequent Teo most often when they haven't even put the gelato out yet. They have great coffee and tea! It's a tad shameful how often I walk over for a large iced coffee, but it gets me through the day! The staff has always been friendly and quick. I've had their gelato twice and it is such a treat! I'd say the bourbon vanilla and exotic fruits are my favorite. People have complained here about the price, but I think it's appropriately priced. They use pure ingredients and have a large covered patio in a central location. You're getting exactly what you pay for. :)",1
Coffee Shop 64,"My boyfriend took me here for the first time after a long day of two back to back labs ugh. We got a medium sized cup and put 4 flavors in one cup haha. I went with salted caramel and some fruity flavor that I think was mango? I honestly can't remember his but all the flavors we got were good. I came here a second time with another friend and the staff was super friendly and was really patient with us as we were sampling and even had conversation with us. I got the salted caramel again and also, cookies and cream. Both were really good and creamy!  Overall, super friendly staff and good gelato. Would come back again!

Adorbs, cute cafe style interior with large outdoor seating complete with fireplace and the Teo adpoted black cat (such a loooover!).  They have several wonderful flavors of gelato and a few dairy free Sorbetto options (fruit flavors) if you're in the mood for a cold, sweet treat. They also offer a varity of coffee and tea options, as well as some paninis and a few other snacks if you're hungry.  Teo is a great place to stop in, sample some of the aforementioned goods, and simply relax.

Coffee Shop 64,"3 check-ins Listed in desserts & sugar, frozen! I'm nuts about Nuts.  It's Tèo's award-winning and wonderful concoction of peanut butter & chocolate hazelnut. It's creamy, flavorful, and still manages not to be too overwhelming. It went perfectly with their peanut butter Oreo flavor, which was loaded with chocolate cookie bliss.  All of their other flavors are decent and pretty unique - Riso is a delicious rice pudding gelato, flavored with cinnamon and filled with small pieces of chewy rice (think ""Horchata"" in gelato form), Captain Crunch tastes exactly like the cereal, and Texas Whiskey & Pecans has a strong alcohol flavor, swirled with caramel and pecans.  Not sure if this is my favorite place to get gelato in Austin, but it's definitely a solid choice. nuts (peanut butter & chocolate hazelnut!) & peanut butter oreo",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Friendly service and great patio.  As for the gelato, perfect consistency.  I just wish the flavoring was a tad bit better.    The Hazelnut, along with the Texican Vanilla are always delish.  Salted Caramel tastes more like just Caramel.  The husband is a fan of the Vanilla Bean, so give that a try if that's your cup of tea.",1

Coffee Shop 64,"2 check-ins I can tell why they were named one of the top gelato places! The gelato is extra creamy with tons of flavor. I ordered the coffee Oreo one and I still crave it to this day. The portions are super small and slightly on the meow expensive side, but this is a place you must try at least once! Coffee Oreo. There's Oreo chunks within the ice cream but they don't show up in the picture. Very small portion though",1
Coffee Shop 64,"We came today to get a scoop of gelato for my daughter.  I'm guessing the owner was the one who ""helped"" us today.  The least friendly person I've ever met.  I did not even feel welcome in the store.  I don't think he said one word to me during my transaction.  Seemed super inconvenienced to be helping us.  The gelato was alright.  Central market is just as good, cheaper and has better service.  Then I was waiting outside the bathroom for at least 5 minutes with a toddler who needed to pee and finally the owner guy says from across the room ""oh you need a key...it's on the bar over there."" So I start looking around for it and eventually find it.  Thanks for helping me dude.  Maybe you should put a sign on the door that says ""YOU NEED A KEY"".  I mean honestly why do you need your bathroom locked?  Just got a terrible vibe from this place and we will not be back.  Two stars for the gelato, zero for the customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Amazing gelato and the folks are pretty friendly! Laid back and quaint patio, feels like the old Austin still not lost.",1
Coffee Shop 64,The gelato at Central Market is way better than this place. It was average at best. Not rich and creamy like I'm used to. The cookies and cream had a minty taste to it.  $10 for two small gelatos. The guy working there seemed miserable too. Sorry. We won't be back.,0
Coffee Shop 64,Tried some gelato while in town on a scorching weekend. I think I got the nuts flavor and it was  pretty good. Service was friendly. Kind of a snug fit inside so try to hit it during off-peak times.,1
Coffee Shop 64,"Multi-Award Winning Gelato for several reasons and flavors! Great neighborhood spot. I only wish they would gussy up their patio with some plants, maybe a privacy trellis... it has the potential to be much prettier and more widely used.

Coffee Shop 64,"Oh Teo, how I've missed you. I used to come all the time with BOGO coupons in the UT Student Discount Book (no, I didn't get both cones for myself). That is a SWEET deal, although I'm not sure they're offering this anymore. They certainly don't need to with all this publicity and recognition from being a finalist in the World Gelato Tour.  I've never tried a flavor I didn't like, and I've tried a shocking number. My favorites are stracciatella and anything with hazelnut. The gelato can be really sweet, so if you're sensitive to that, maybe go with the sorbets.  There's free wifi and ample seating/parking. I'll never understand why there's never a line here. Calling all hipsters!",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Extremely friendly staff and pretty good gelato. I got a large (4 flavors), and for the price it seems you get a pretty decent amount of gelato. I chose Texican vanilla, salted caramel, bourbon vanilla, and exotic fruit. Of those, I'd say my favorite were the exotic fruit and salted caramel. Throwing the fruity flavor in was a strange mix, especially since the gelato melts after a while. If getting many flavors, I'd recommend getting some that blend together well, just in case you don't finish before it starts melting :)  I went at a peak time, Friday night. The indoor environment seems pretty loud, with or without other people present. There's a constant loud hum from some of their machinary or AC I presume. If there's at least a group or two, it gets louder with them trying to talk over the loud hum. I would recommend noise-isolating or noise-cancelling earphones/headphones if you're looking to study or do some work here. Or maybe try sitting outside on the patio; I didn't try because it was too humid when I went.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"We've been to Italy and this is not Gelato! This is more like ice crushed with ice cream! The place was empty and they barely had any Gelato in the display. This place is also very expensive! 4x tiny cups for $17? Yeah, never again! Threw it on the ground! Gross!",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Amazing does not do this place justice. Their gelato has literally won WORLD WIDE awards for flavors like TEXAS WHISKEY PECAN, goat cheese/cherry, NUTS (peanut butter & Nutella).

It's a bit expensive but in the tiny you do get a lot of gelato! The staff was very sweet and allowed us to try a bunch of things which was nice.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Went in at 9pm, they close at 10pm.  Employees were vacuuming and could care less that we walked in.

After my 3 year old daughter ate it I overheard another employee tell other customers it was sugar-free which meant my daughter just ate aspartame...something we do not believe any human should eat.  THANKS FOR THAT!!!!  Also a big thanks for not telling us that had we paid cash our bill would have been 50% off.  It was great to hear you tell other customers that after we paid.

Coffee Shop 64,"I'm writing this review due to the lack of professionalism from the owner/manager. My coworkers  and I  went to Teo's today for some gelato. We have been there many times before, but after todays visit we will never go there again.  There was a line and from what we could tell only one person helping those in line. The owner aka Matt was just finishing up making a coffee. All of a sudden Matt (owner) yells at the only guy working the line to hurry up all the while Matt is just standing there not doing anything. I'm not sure what Matt's problem was with this poor guy. There were two other people standing there just scooping ice cream into to go containers. Why couldn't one of them help out? If there are paying customers standing in front of you stop what you are doing and help them out. Then Matt goes over to the table where my coworkers are sitting and complains to them about this poor guy. Dude, if you have time to complain you have time to scoop gelato. Finally this poor guy asks me what I want and then Matt comes over and tells him to get more gelato from the back. Are you kidding me?? Matt are your arms broken? There were other people behind the counter that could have filled the gelato case!! Hey here is an idea, you do it!!!! Then Matt also disappears to the back at which point we here him screaming at this poor guy from the back.  Matt I think you are a horrible manager! If you can't get your staff to do their job maybe you should take some management courses on how to treat people! While your at it take some anger management courses too!! We did not walk out of your place today due to slow service. We left because of you and how unprofessional you are.  PS embarrassing your employees in front of everyone in your store only makes you look like a bigger ass!",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Very original gelato, well deserved Restaurant Poll award for best gelato five times. Very pleased with the service, products, and atmosphere. A must on every Austinite's dessert list.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"This is really good gelato--so good, in fact, that Teo is one of three finalists in the Gelato World Tour and will settle the score in Rimini, Italy come September 2014.  If that's not enough to convince you to try this, then nothing will.  I had the goat cheese and cherry, the lemon sorbet, and a strawberry/raspberry shake.  They were all spectacularly delicious.  I also had a free sample of the Nuts flavor, which is a peanut butter + chocolate hazelnut concoction that punched Teo's ticket to the Gelato World Tour finals.  So if you're thinking gelato in Austin, Teo's needs to be in the conversation if not outright winning it.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Teo is gelato heaven. I love their Salted Caramel flavor. Supposedly their Honey flavored gelato is to die for, but whenever I go they never have it. Where is the Honey?!    Never crowded, Teo is a great place for coffee and work, without the people watching distractions. The inside is small and quiet with plenty of outlets.  Every year they have a Thanksgiving Hand Turkey contest. I was so obsessed with making my turkey just to compete for a gift card for their gelato...no shame.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"2 check-ins The gelato is on the pricy side compares to the other gelato places in town. Not all the gelato are out in the freezer, while asked to try out the different favors, the only guy behinds the counter has to go back and forth. They are very short staffed, we waited 5 mins till the guys has a chance to serve us. The general environment is sticky and gross because they are so short staffed, the bathroom handle is sticky and gross, so are all the tables. The coffee menu has no prices on it, so the only server had to go back and forth to the counter just to check out the price. The 12oz iced coffee is $3!! The priciest I ever had in town. I probably will never come back for this place, it's not a cozy hangout place.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Excellent gelato and coffee. This place really serves excellent products, but the atmosphere is really lacking. It gets 5 stars for its gelato and coffee but 2 for atmosphere. If they would just provide comfortable seating, use softer lighting, do some redecorating, and play some some music, this place would be fantastic.",1
Coffee Shop 64,Their strawberry is amazing!!!! They are also known for their nuts flavor and Texas whiskey and pecan. The Texas whiskey and pecan is pretty good if you like bourbon.,1
Coffee Shop 64,"2 check-ins Listed in Dessert Destinations Holy gelato Batman!  This place has won national recognition recently, and it is well deserved. It has always been great, and it still is. The prices are fair, the quality is great, there is a private parking lot, and there is rarely a line.  It may not be the newest or trendiest place in town, but it's wonderful nonetheless.  I am particularly enamored of their nut flavors and salted caramel.  There is a reason I wanted this stuff delivered across the street to Seton Central to celebrate my having just given birth. Because it rocks.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"We stopped by Teo's today for a snack, and were charged $5.89 for one scoop of gelato on a cone.  We ordered a two-scoop cone and watched the server put only one (quite small) scoop on the cone.  When we pointed out his error, he insisted that we were wrong and that we owed him for two scoops.  Teo just lost a couple of faithful customers, that's for sure!",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Personally love Gelato for the sheer fact it provides a stronger flavor and is not as bad as ice cream. When I heard about Teo [and saw its popularity/review rating] decided to check it out with my wife.  First off, when we got into the shop, there was an odd smell we couldn't describe (not a good sign). When we approached the Gelato counter, we were kind of shocked at the offered flavors. None really looked fresh and most of them looked like they were very soft/melting (probably and issue with their refrigeration). The flavors they offered were not what I would typically see like Captain Crunch, Oreo etc. Ummm when I think of Gelato I'm looking for flavors like Pistachio, Meyer Lemon etc. I want something flavorful, refreshing, and preferably natural.  We ended up grabbing the Key Lime, Hazlenut, and Texican Vanila. All were pretty soft (like it more firm), and the work part was the Key Lime especially was SUPER bitter, with very large pieces of zest in it.  If you're looking for good Gelato, this is probably not the place for you.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"I'll be back for more gelato and espresso. I had the goat cheese cherry, and it was enchanting.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Gelato is good, but there are other places in town that have just as good gelato.  The traditional cappuccino is fantastic.   The service not so great.  I took my daughter to Teo after school for a treat.  When we arrived there was a girl cleaning the glass door.  She did not not say hello, nor did she stop to allow us to enter.  When she was done she simply walked in and did not even hold the door open.   We ordered our gelato and went and sat outside.  I had also ordered a cappuccino.  The guy that made my cappuccino did not bring me my coffee, nor did he signal for me to come get it.  He simply left it on the bar and disappeared.  I suppose if they had been busy I might have understood but they were not.  Even if your gelato was all that, the people that work there are not polite and obviously do not understand the basics of customer service.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Don't get me wrong. The gelato is good. Sometimes a little too sweet, but whatever. This review is mostly for the owner.  I try to go to Teo's a couple of times a week, cause it's close, but I avoid that place like the plague when the owner is around.  He. Is. So. Mean.  Like downright mean to his employees, rude to customers. I can't stand it. I want to stand up for his employees and tell them ""IT GETS BETTER!!! YOU DONT HAVE TO TAKE THIS! DAMN THE MAN!"" - but I'm afraid they'll get fired for it.  Like seriously, the owner is a man in his 50's? Brown hair, dresses preppy, and always has a permanent scowl on his face. AVOID HIM and you'll most likely have an okay experience.  On the flipside....try the Cap'n Crunch Gelato, that shit is ON POINT.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"I usually only go for the fruity flavors when it comes to ice cream and yogurt. BUT, today I tried the coconut Nutella gelato and omg it was amazing! My boyfriend got the dark chocolate gelato and it's so rich in flavor! I totally recommend you stop by!",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Excellent gelato! Not as tasty as Italy, and the displays aren't as beautiful.  But very close.  I recommend the Pistachio and Goat Cheese & Cherry.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Very much on a main street yet off the beaten path, Teo is a small but roomy gellato shop.  Located directly across from Seton Hospital, 1 mile east of the MOPAC, on 38th and 1/2 St.  38th and 1/2 St can be murder during traffic and is a turn off (pun intended) to get to most shops, restaurants, and Seton along the way.  Don't go during high traffic times.  I used to bike from my place in Rosedale to the Hyde Park Gym, and would alwasy go by this place.  Unless you have alternate means of transportation (or you take Medical Pkway), wait until later in the evening.  I would recommend skipping dessert at Waterloo's or the other restaurants in the vicinity to try an espresso and ""4-6% butterfat content"" delicious gellato (ice cream is 30-40%!).  Enjoy your treats out on the patio of course (this IS Austin).  Some of my favorites: vanilla bean with salted caramel, orange vanilla (tastes like a dreamcicle), and the sorbets are great too!  Gellato can be expensive anywhere, but Teo sometimes offers discounted days.  I believe this was Tuesday.  This could have changed since I've been back.  With all the competitors slinging high fat content gellato and ice cream, remember: ""Tèo rich & creamy gelato means all the sin without the guilt!""",1
Coffee Shop 64,"This place is where you want to go for Gelato in this town! Usually when someone suggests getting gelato I'm thinking they are either a 'hipster' or one of those 'healthy eaters' who avoids indulgent treats... Not so at TEO. I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out Gelato over ice cream.  It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy.  Some of my personal favorites (though it's so difficult to pick just one) are the goat cheese and cherry - it is incredible and a must try! Coffee and oreo, nuts, whiskey pecan, coconut Nutella (can you think gelato mounds bar?) - heck they're all deliciously amazing!  You won't be disappointed.  They have a nice little patio with a fireplace outside and lots of newspapers to read inside. Even a TV if there's a major sporting event (usually European, so think world cup games). Dogs are welcome. Kids are often seen here mingling among those doing business.  It's truly a neighborhood place immediately across the street from Seton Hospital.  I'm not a coffee drinker so I cannot speak to the quality of their offering in that dept. They do have hot chocolate and it is one place that serves apple cider here locally (year round). While the cider doesn't compare with cider mills' on-site cider you get in other parts of the country, it still brings back good memories. (Personally,  I'd avoid the whipped cream and carmelized topping on it because then it just tastes like a dessert drink; to me, a great cider should stand on it's own.) If you have lived where you went to apple orchards or cider mills however, you may be disappointed. It's still worth a try. Pick up a breakfast taco or two as well.  And there are always a few sandwiches available in case you are hungry. My one suggestion/wish is that they would expand ever so slightly their food menu. Sometimes I would like to get something to eat and it's not always an option especially later in the day.  But TEO is still a real gem overall.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"I got a small iced cafe latte with almond milk for $6, however I tasted the smoothest espresso I've ever had by far! Liquid velvet and not too acidic.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"I wish I had visited Teo before. The texture, taste and the flavors of the Gelato were amazing. I had the coffee and Oreo Gelato and it was delicious. The staff were very accommodating and warm. We tried a couple of flavors and every single one was yum! Now I know where to go when I crave dessert. (Healthy as well) ;)",1
Coffee Shop 64,"This place has excellent gelato - seriously. We came in last night and a friendly staff member helped us choose our flavors and offered us numerous samples. We all had something a little different, but the whiskey pecan, mango and nuts gelatos were incredibly wonderful. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll certainly be stopping by!",1
Coffee Shop 64,I discovered this place when I lived in Austin while in college.  They by far have the best gelato i've ever tasted!  I find myself always referencing back to Teo's whenever I try any other gelato and it just doesn't compare! My favorite flavor is the chocolate hazelnut! You can go here even in the winter time because they have an outdoor fireplace w/ seating area. Anyone I've ever taken here has fallen in love with the place.,1
Coffee Shop 64,"Had the best carmel macchiato! It wasn't overpoweringly sweet like most places.  If a carmel macchiato has depth, this is what it would taste like. My family had the vanilla, nuts, chocolate and salted carmel gelato, all tasted awesome, however everyone really wanted to steal moms, she had the nuts gelato. Jake, my 3 year old, enjoying his very first vanilla bean gelato. Yummy.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Wow! Teo is amazing for so many reasons:  1. Gelato - first and foremost this is legit gelato! The owner told me they make their own base and are committed offering lower fat desserts. Did you know gelato is usually 50% less fat than ice cream?!  2. Flavors - They must put out over 20 flavors a day: mint oreo, rosemary chocolate, goat cheese and honey, salted caramel, and the list goes on! They are made fresh daily, so if you go later in the day there will be more options. My vegan mother was excited she could select from the many sorbetto flavors.  2. Espresso - the traditional cappuccino is addictive. I'd venture to say this is the best coffee I've had in Austin.  3. Parking - there is plenty of it!  4. Patio - partially shaded deck you can enjoy on a pleasant day.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Went on a Saturday evening, not a lot of people there at that point (I think we were there a little earlier than any crowds). I got ""Nuts"" (the peanut butter/Nutella one), which was really yummy, but I think my expectations were a little high - I got Nutella gelato in Rome and it was kind of life changing, so I shouldn't compare anything to that, but it's hard not to. The girl scooping the gelato also seemed really bitter about being there, or maybe she was having a bad day. We enjoyed our gelato and sitting on the patio was really nice, but honestly this place isn't going to be a first choice for dessert for me.",1
Coffee Shop 64,Had my first Teo experience recently after many people telling me to visit. I am loving it! Delicious!  I'm kind of curious why there isn't an additional location! I need one closer to me near West Anderson! 4 bucks and change for a cup with 2 flavors. It's a nice after dinner treat. Having strawberry always gets you bonus points too.  They have plenty of outdoor seating and a fireplace for the colder months. I'm definitely going to be checking Teo out at the World Gelato Tour coming up in Austin!,1
Coffee Shop 64,"This place is fantastic. Both times we have gone we have had super friendly service, and fantastic gelato. The prices are really reasonable, too. The cups look small, but this stuff is rich and wonderful! I love that they have such a variety of flavors, too. I love their captain crunch, latte and oreo flavors. We will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Great place to hang out after a dinner downtown. Amazing gelato, solid coffee, and a laid back atmosphere. My favorite! (Fruits of Forest) Fruits of Forest!",1
Coffee Shop 64,Such a great first experience! I came here looking for a place to study & enjoy some time and I did just that. Staff was great and extremely nice.. he even convinced me to get some gelato (which was amazing btw) 5 stars!!,1
Coffee Shop 64,We had their Texas Pecan Pie gelato today-- delicious! I understand why they were a finalist at the Gelato World Tour. I highly recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 64,Best gelato and coffee. I went to Italy and could not resist getting gelato almost every night and now that I am back I eat here. When I was at UT as a student I said that when I graduated and got a decent paying job I would get coffee and gelato from here where ever I could.... now that that has happened I have not regreted my multiple visits.,1
Coffee Shop 64,"A family favorite.  Friendly folks, great product.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"One of my all time favorites! I remember when they took over the space from CCs coffee & made the transition to a sleek Italian spot for yummies. Matt & Anna have continued to make adjustments based on feedback from customers.  He studied in Italy under a wellknown Coffee guru & brought those skills, an Italian barrista , and genuine equipment back with him. They have had award-winning gelato before it was trendy. It's no surprise they have gotten the Chronicle's ""Best of"" award every year for the past 10 years. Patio & fireplace Gelato & espresso - Best of Austin for 10 years New sign",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Great gelato, refreshing to see new flavors besides the typical offerings. You haven't lived until you have tried the Peanut Butter Nutella.. so good.  Stop by in the morning for an espresso drink, if you are lucky it will be hand crafted by a real Italian barista.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"I work at Urban Betty, which is just around the corner from Teo. Love this place for an afternoon pick-me-up soy latte or some dairy free gelato! Deelish",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Gelato and espresso notwithstanding, I will not be patronizing Teo's because of the owner's attitude toward his staff and potential staff--and though I rarely write Yelp reviews, I believe those interested in supporting ethical local businesses should know about this.    I recently applied for a barista position at Teo's and had the worst interview experience of my life with Teo's owner. I had two pleasant interviews with managers before speaking with him. Here's a sampling of the interview questions he asked me, many of which are very gendered, and a number of which are simply illegal:  -What does your father do for a living? -Where do you live? Do you live with a boyfriend or a girlfriend? -What street did you grow up on? -Let's say your best friend sets you up on a blind date with a boy, but then you get free tickets to see your favorite band. What do you do? -Are you on medication?  I'm not sure why the owner chose to be so nasty during our interview, but if he's willing to treat a potential hire like this, I'm very concerned about his treatment of his staff.",0
Coffee Shop 64,"Sometimes ice cream can be a little too rich for a hot day. That's when I like to hop over to Teo.  A small can be had for about $3.60 and you can select two flavors. That part can be tricky -- which two flavors? Latte with Hazelnut Chocolate Chip? Or Texican Vanilla with Salted Caramel?  They have lots of options, all are tasty even the Captain Crunch. It's a good place to take kids or a date on a Saturday night.  My favorite flavors are Chocolate Chip and PB & Nutella. Help yo'self!",1
Coffee Shop 64,Coffee oreo is phenomenal! The latte chocolate chip and captain crunch are soooo good. Mocha latte served in a coffee cup is a nice touch. I finished my gelato and i am tempted to order some more! Great service too!,1
Coffee Shop 64,"I adore this shopping center.  Inside this awesome shopping center lies TEO with its delectable gelato.   I had trouble deciding on just a couple of flavors.  They are not stingy with the samples, so I got to try nearly everything I wanted.  In the end I got the Nutella one and some chocolate, chocolate chocolate one.  I had also asked for a pistachio scoop, but the girl forgot and I didn't notice until I was well into the first scoop.  Oh well, no one is perfect.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"I just recently moved here and I just had Teo for the first time. I was greet nicely and the lady working there asked if I wanted to sample. I was surprised with the variety of flavors to choose from. They even had some sugar/fat free options if I decided if I wanted to cut back something. But for today I wanted full flavor. So I got the small that comes up to 2 flavors, I gotten the tiramasu and PB/Nutella. They were rich and creamy, enjoy every bite. I loved the size portion as well, I would think anything bigger would be too much for me. My girlfriend and I really enjoy eating here and they were dog friendly outside the porch. I recommend this to anyone who's up for eating sweets.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"Listed in Sugary Goodness! The Gelato here is pretty legit. I had the Latte gelato... at night! hahas hopefully it won't affect my sleep tonight. However, I didn't give a care in the world. The gelato was nice and smooth.  This plus a nice peaceful environment with heavenly A/C to rescue me from the Texas heat makes Teo a great option for a nice summer time treat! Definitely better than getting froyo!",1
Coffee Shop 64,"After a night of light drinking and gorging ourselves at dinner, there was just a wee bit of room for something sweet. We decided to grab some gelato at Teo's. At first, I was a bit taken aback by the teensy-weensy serving cups there. But I later realized that due to the richness, even the small is more than enough.  We had the salted caramel and also the vanilla. Both were excellent. Okay, maybe the small wasn't enough, because I actually ordered a medium. Guilty.",1
Coffee Shop 64,"ROTD Did you know that gelato supposedly has less fat than ice cream? Many are made with milk and not pure cream, so its less guilty to eat which means you can eat more. There, now I gave you a reason to indulge.  Gelato is always presented so beautifully, how does one resist? Teo's gelato is beautiful and hits the spot fo sho! I have only tried a fraction of what they offer, but I know Salted Caramel will always appear in my cup.",1

When my baby, When my baby smiles at me, I go to Teo...""  With all due apologies to Pablo Cruise, I dedicate this review to a cool little gelato and espresso shop just across from Seton Hospital.  Their location may not seem significant, until you find yourself staying with a family member who suddenly gets a hankering for frozen yogurt late on a Sunday afternoon.  Then, you hit the Yelp maps, and find that, although the TCBY you remembered just up the road has closed, this little espresso and gelato shop across the street will do just fine, and they're open until 10 PM.  One star boost for location, location, location and availability.  Then you actually visit and find a charming little store with very friendly staff who are patient with a first time customer who needs nothing more than a medium two-flavor serving to go with appropriate packaging.  So many flavors, so many decisions, such little cups!  But all questions were answered with a smile and to my complete satisfaction, and I was in and out in under 5 minutes.  Certainly a one star boost for customer-oriented service.  The only downside was that I didn't get to taste very much of the gelato, since it was intended for someone else.  But I did taste what stuck to the underside of the lid, and it seemed quite good.  It's hard to say I'd love to go back, since Teo is far from my home and daily travels, and since going back probably means other than fun times.  But, given the opportunity and circumstances, I'd love to give them another shot--this time, on the eating end of things.",1

I mean the flavors here are redic good..good is actually a tame descrip...the sweet & salt combo was out of this world with the caramel and that captn crunch wtf!!!! My nephew loves tart stuff and he had the lemon gelato...whew was it tart!!! But in a good fun way!!! All of this stuff was non dairy water whipped just like whenya cook crack!!!

Coffee Shop 64,"Superb Gelato in the neighborhood just north of campus, Teo is nestled among a host of hospitals and other medical facilities. While lacking the exquisite perfection of the gelato at Dolce Neve, the creamy goodness here should not be discounted. In addition their serving sizes are absolutely humongous and should be treated with caution; you've gotta really want it if you think you can take down the large serving size. As with most gelato the flavor is light and pleasant for most flavors; pairings such as salted caramel, Oreo and a peanut butter Nutella combine a rich sweetness with that light creaminess to hit most of the high notes. It's great gelato worth a stop if you are ever in the area.",1

Coffee Shop 64,"Teo is in my neighborhood and their gelato and smoothies are excellent.  I also like that they have grab-and-go tacos in the morning from Tacodeli - much faster!  We like to take the dogs and sit on the deck.  They even have a water dish for dogs.  I've been many times since they opened and I'm always pleased.  One suggestion:  I was there Friday, Feb. 21 at about 7pm and the very nice young woman behind the counter barked ""what?!"" at everyone in front of me in line.  She said sorry, the freezers are loud, but perhaps she could say ""excuse me?"" or ""could you repeat that?"" instead.  :)",1
Coffee Shop 64,Pretty cool coffee shop that serves gelato. The place isn't too big but could probably fit about 20 people sitting inside. The gelato is pretty good and the coffee ain't bad either. It's been a while since I've been here so i'll update this review next time I go but it's definitely a place I would go to again for some coffee and ice cream but not necessarily study (hard chairs and can get loud if there are several people),1

Go and grab them early as they usually run out by early afternoon!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"M-A-C-A-R-O-N-S.  So good here. Unbeatable. The flakiness and the quality of the pastry itself is only outdone by the flavors used in these treats.

Lavender-frosted lavender cake! I received this cake in October.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Atmosphere makes the experience, and this cafe is just delightful.

Decent amount of parking in the back as well. Chocolate and rose",1
Coffee Shop 38,Cute little bakery located near the greetings from austin wall mural. We had the cinnamon cronut with vanilla cream and chocolate cronut with peanut butter cream. We also received a free macaron with check in so we tried the salted caramel & almond. ($7 minimum purchase for the free macaron offer)  Not the best macarons I've had but the texture was still pretty soft. If you prefer your macarons with flavor but not super sweet- you should check this place out. I was pretty impressed with their cronuts because they were still moist & fluffy and again not too sweet. I would come back to try other things if I am in the area. Took a bite before I could snap a photo -_-,1
Coffee Shop 38,"The perfect place for a relaxing, Sunday afternoon. The light coming in through the windows, the soothing French sounds of Edith Piaf, and, of course, the delicate sweet treats. I couldn't have picked a better place to read Proust and meander through sentences that last longer than a French macaron.  I shall return in search of this place again, but altering my experience and I'll explain why below.  Pros: -Interior decor transports you back to a 100-year-old home with hardwood floors, white walls, and light gliding through window panes. -My first French macaron (Chocolate Chile): Soft, sweet, with a spice on the back of the tongue, all collapsing in my mouth. Much better than I ever imagined something so small could taste. -The Cronut: Cinnamon, sugar, and cream in a donut. Would definitely order this again.  Cons: -The room where the light travels into is also the children's playroom. There were no children playing on this day thankfully but I'm foreseeing future problems. -I adore Chocolate Croissants. The buttery, flaky texture sweetened by a semi-sweet chocolate filling, ah yes. Alas, this was not that. No flaky. No buttery. Dry and more like bread than the croissants I'm used to. This is what I won't be ordering next time. -This place was popular on this quiet afternoon among loud bachelerettes on some kind of tour. Luckily, the service was so fast that they used the restroom and ordered their treats in a few minutes without disturbing my afternoon reading for too long.  Also, use Yelp App & Check-In for the free Macaron. It's worth it. Chocolate chile macaron, chocolate croissant, and a cronut.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Best macarons I've ever had. My favorites are rose, lavender, and pistachio, but really everything is great. As awesome as the macarons are, the crobrio is in a league of its own. Delicious flavor and texture, and you can tell there's a ton of skill involved in making it, definitely worth it's slightly higher price. They run out of items, so it's best to get there earlier.  This is easily my favorite bakery in Austin, and I'm looking forward to their new location. Chocolate peanut butter crobrio and pistachio and lavender macarons. Amazing!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Checked in an got a free macaroon - chocolate espresso - it was delicious! Wasn't too sweet or sugary. Was made with good quality ingredients and definitely tasted that way. But my favorite thing was the Paris Brest pastry - it's a cross between an eclair and croissant and has a peanut butter filling that they fill at order. Topped with a chocolate ganache and nuts. To die for! This is the first time I've seen this at a French bakery or any bakery for that matter and I hope it's not my last. Also this bakery is right next to the iconic Austin mural so after you take your picture, you can step in for some goodies! Delicious peanut butter Paris Brest pastry. It's a cross between an eclair and croissant. The most memorable pastry I've ever had Sign outside",1
Coffee Shop 38,"2 check-ins I wouldnt say this is the first place I think about when someone mentions donuts, but you must try a Cro Brio before you die. If it's a donut, than this may be the only place I recommend eating said donut with a knife and fork.  This place is small, cozy and very cute. They have a selectioned off area for little children to play in a separate, but attached room making the ambience very comfortable in this old house.  I enjoy the French theme and their cold brew is good. 3.50 for a small 12oz and 3.75 for a large 16oz. Just get the large. Soy and almond milk available.  Great for a quick pick up afternoon coffee, or simple date, or needing to satisfy that sweet tooth.  Next door is the ""Greetings from Austin"" tourist stop so this place does see it's fair share of tourists.  Awesome check in offer: One free macaroon. Several choices.  They have a second location on Burnet Rd.  I still need to try their sandwiches and more drinks, and will update my review then. Mmmmm Macaroons!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"15 check-ins Get here early if you want to have the most choices of macaroons! They run out and I'm not even kidding.

I do enjoy their other pastries too but I will never drive by this place without grabbing at least a couple of macaroons. I have tried macaroons in France, NY, and LA but these are still the best out of them all. The location is tiny so there is limited space for parking but this area is pretty friendly to pedestrians so don't worry about parking a bit down the street and taking a stroll to get here. The staff is always friendly and their presentation of the pastries is very cute and hospitable. The interior does not have that much seating but somehow manages to have a small kiddy play area in the corner of the room so they are definitely kid-friendly! I always bring out-of-towners here and also take macaroons to family who lives out of town also. That goes to show how much I love these guys and take pride in their ability to put a smile on your face. *they usually have rose and lavender if you get there before they run out - these are both really worth trying*  love love love .. love this place",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I finally had a chance to try the famous CroBrio on a rainy Saturday afternoon and it did not disappoint! When I arrived I was lucky enough to find a parking spot in their lot at the back. I had called earlier to see if there were any more CrioBrio's left before I'd make the long commute over and a nice gentlemen said that he'd be happy to put some aside for me. I also grabbed a lavender macaron and a plain cup of the house coffee. I had the vanilla cream cinnamon sugar CroBrio and by looking at it, I thought that it was going to be way too sweet but it was perfect...literally perfect. I wouldn't change a thing! The macaron for me was just alright but I also didn't get to try any of the other flavors. Come here for the CroBrio, and grab more to go! Vanilla cream stuffed CroBrio!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I was crazing macarons and found La Pâtisserie. Super cute shop, friendly employees, and absolutely delicious macarons. I love all things lavender and their lavender macaron did not disappoint. They also have traditional flavors and seasonal varieties. Can't go wrong with any of them. Looking forward to my next trip!",1
Coffee Shop 38,My kids wanted to try eclair sap stopped by. They split the chocolate and salted caramel eclair sand each got a macaroon. My husband and I split the crobrio. All of it was delicious!  The crobrio was amazing. I tasted both eclairs and the salted caramel was my favorite. The toasted almond macaroon was the best macaroon I have ever tasted. My only complaint was the iced cold brew coffee - it was too strong and very bitter. Not at all like the smooth cold brews I'm used to. Definitely worth stopping by for some pastries. Crobrio is DELICIOUS,1
Coffee Shop 38,"Quaint, children friendly better than any orher french pastry shop i have tried ! And that is more than 3 dozen ! A real treat. Try the creamy salted carmel macaroon and zuch bread !",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I was in the area and decided to give this cute place a shot.  I ordered a chocolate croissant that was divine.  The chocolate melted right in your mouth if you ask them to warm it up for you.  It was perfection.    The macaroons didn't disappoint either.  They were very tasty.  You get a free one for checking in on Yelp so make sure you get yours.  They also have self serve cubed sugar.  It's the cutest ever.  For a minute you could actually be in Paris.    The atmosphere is so adorable.  There is something about old homes that get me every time.  The tall ceilings, original hard wood floors & wall to ceiling breadboard.  Not to mention the white space.  They have plenty of seating for you to sit and enjoy your pastry.  It's also only a stone throw away from the iconic Austin mural.  Add them to your Yelp bookmarks. See all photos from Ann Marie N. for La Patisserie",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I'm from out of town and was really excited to try the macaroons here. I ordered a day ahead to make sure they had the flavors I wanted. Sadly, they forgot about my order because they gave me a random assortment of  the flavors I didn't want. Most of the macaroons were stale and even crunchy!!! The only flavor that seemed fresh was the lavender. I'm very disappointed Valentine's Day Macaroons Lavender macaroon",0
Coffee Shop 38,"Stopped by this location while exploring Austin. It's located in a neighborhood, and looks like a house. You will probably miss it if you aren't looking carefully. It's right next to the greetings from Austin mural though, so make sure you take a picture.  I was very interested in trying the cronuts upon arrival. I saw that they were on top of the counter, looking a little saggy and depressed. I bought one to eat thinking it wouldn't be that great, but it was really good. If you have a sweet tooth like me, it had the right amount of sweetness. It was flaky and the filling inside was good too. I tried the peanut butter filling one and the vanilla bean, both which were good. But highly recommend the vanilla bean one because it's covered in cinnamon sugar.  The macarons were ok, I had the toasted almond one and it had a great taste to it. Bakery goodies! Cronuts and toasted almond macaron",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Updated review 6 check-ins La Patisserie, I am sad. You had me hooked on your big cream puffs filled with rich, ooey, gooey vanilla bean goodness. I came back this weekend after taking a half a year to a year long hiatus from stuffing my face silly with your sinful delights only to find that you had completely changed the cream puff that I so longingly daydreamed about. It is now a mini cream puff- which I can deal with- but the star of the show, the cream itself, is completely different and not so delectable anymore. What gives?!  Edit: Someone took this very personally and pmed me about my updated review. LOLLZZ. For the sake of humoring this person, I will also note that the chocolate croissant I purchased this weekend was lackluster. According to Yelp, 2 stars expresses something along the lines of ""I've had better,"" and I've very definitely had better.",0
Coffee Shop 38,"I'm not the kind of guy to rave about a tiny, French bakery tucked away in South Austin, but they really should have put 'YOU WILL SEE THE FACE OF GOD' on the menu.  It's that good.  I had the cronut thing. Whatever you call it. It was sublime. And? I had my very first macarons. Are they always that good? Because those were delicious.  My only gripe is the price. For a fancy donut and 2 macarons, $10 was a bit much. That said, I will be back every week.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Having first tried only the bread that was given to me on a food truck tour, I was so happy that I finally got around to coming here. Very limited indoor seating, especially since this was a very chilly, cloudy, yucky Saturday morning, and my friend and I ended up having to sit outside. It was difficult to decide among all of the beautiful options, but eventually we decided to split an almond macaroon, a raspberry pistachio pastry and a lemon blueberry scone. Everything was perfect and beautiful! The coffee, however, is where it fell flat for me. I ordered an almond milk latte, and while it got the job done, I would not go back for espresso beverages alone. However, I am completely smitten with this place. Raspberry pistachio pastry, almond macaroon, and a blueberry lemon scone",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Updated review Still a completely quaint place that I had been away from for far too long.  I got a mocha, delicious, still coffee. . . .Not like some of these hot chocolate tasting things that are called mochas - really nice.  I had the walnut/apple croissant - the pastry was nice but I would like more filling.    My friend had a wild berry (maybe wild strawberry?) macaroon that was really nice as well, in fact she's hooked and we're going back.  She had a peppermint mocha that she enjoyed.    Such a sweet, charming place.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"The macarons are wonderful! Since I'd never tried them before, it was a pleasant surprise at how light and flavorful they were. Spent a nice Sunday afternoon there and it was very pleasant! Will definitely go back again!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"3 check-ins This place has a great location right next to Roadhouse Relics with the Greetings from Austin mural.  If you come here, get some croissants, savory or sweet, they're delicious!  However, skip out on the macarons.  There seems to be plenty of glowing reviews of the macarons here, but I must disagree.  The cookies are rather cakey and lack the delicate eggshell-like crust.  It's more like biting into a brownie than a French macaron.  Just looking at them, you can see the bumpy surface indicates that the almond flour hasn't been sifted finely enough.  TLDR: Don't waste your time with the macarons, but definitely go for the croissants or crobrios.",0
Coffee Shop 38,"Accidentally found this place while taking friends for a photo op by the Austin mural. We decided to stop for a snack. Their macaroons are seriously the best I have ever had. Perfect texture, slightly sweet, a little crunchy - absolute perfection!  They also had very good coffee. My friend had the custard filled, chocolate covered cro-nut. It was also very very good. A little ""too"" much for me, but perfect for those that love a sugar bang!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I give this place 4 start, but the Cronuts are amazing!!!...specifically the chocolate peanut butter one. It will change your life...seriously.  It's airy, light, balanced and not too sweet. The chocolate i think is dark chocolate, the peanut butter compliments but doesn't overwhelm and the filling is smooth and creamy. I also had a latte and the drink was good.  The place itself is tiny and IT NEEDS BACKGROUND MUSIC. It's clean, but charming in size:)  Overall the cronut has a great balance of each ingredient and I've been craving another one ever sense. I'd recommend going there and getting it to go.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Beautiful, relaxing place for a sweet treat. Tons of gluten free options. A few comfy chair and a nice outdoor space. Totally worth a visit when I am in the area. The chocolate macaroon was absolutely delicious and the gluten free brownie rich and cinnamon-y. Lovely treat!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Gotta go for the macarons! I came here just to try out their macarons but I got more than I expected. Location is next to houses and a small business strip.. The parking is behind the bakery and the lot is a bit small.  I got three macarons: Passion fruit, cademon honey and wild strawberry. The passion fruit was just ok but I that was just a random pick. The cademon and honey was pretty good, didn't really have a distinct flavor but you can taste the honey. The wild strawberry was my second favorite, this was a simple flavor.  My rating goes mostly to the texture. To me, macarons are all about texure! The shell to the inner and the filling. The shell was a bit grainy, guessing they didn't sift the flour enough.. The inner was good, not too wet and not too dry. In other words..chewy but not too crunchy.  The fillings were all good, wasn't overloaded but had enough. With a macaron the textures should be semi hard to soft to really soft. I'm no expert baker but I am a baker so I've made these before.  The cool part of my visit was the pastry happy hour! Never seen a bakery that does happy hour but it's a good idea. HH deal is half off all croissant pastries. I had the almond croissant and it was delish! The first words that came out of my mouth was oh my gosh! HH is 3pm to close to better get yourself over there before they close!  Reason #3 to visit Austin again! woo lala",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Not a French bakery at all. The macarons were crispy as a meringue,  éclair filled with butter cream and chocolate croissant in the fridge... Very disappointed to not be able to find a true french bakery in austin.",0
Coffee Shop 38,"Super cute pastry shop in South Austin! My friend and I picked up a dozen macarons and coffee and we were extremely pleased with our choices. I particularly loved the lavender and the pistachio macarons but the other flavors are just as great. The place is pretty tiny, so I would be safe and make your order to go.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Listed in Treat yo self! Macaroons are so hard to describe to someone who has never had one before. The outsides have an eggshell like crunch, and the inside is soft and gooey like a marshmallow. There is a delicate cream filling in the center and the flavors are often soft and subtle. These two bite treats are so light and airy that you can eat a million before you even realize it. But it's ok since they are made with egg whites, meaning they have zero calories and are practically health food. ( in my mind at least ;-) )  There is a check in offer for yelpers to get 2 free mini macaroons with a $7 purchase. They were out of those when I went so they gave me one full size for free instead. Can I just say how amazing their display case is? Homemade pop tarts, lovely cakes, macaroons the colors of the rainbow, and chocolate croissants, oh my! They also make frou frou coffee drinks that look delicious.  There were no flavor signs by the macaroons but the awesome lady behind the counter took the time to list each one off for me. Some of their seasonal flavors right now include caramel apple, gingerbread, and two types of peppermint ones (I believe one with white and one with milk chocolate fillings, but not entirely sure).  For myself I chose two vanilla ones because they are my favorite, one champagne, one caramel apple, and one espresso. The champagne one blew me away. I was not expecting it to be bright pink and almost shimmery in color but it was phenomenal!! Honestly I thought they all were! I would love to come back here again for a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant. The inside is cozy and smells divine. What better gift idea than a few macaroons for the people you love most? I know it would be a gift I would be more than happy to receive!! Clockwise from top left: vanilla, espresso, caramel apple, and champagne macaroons",1
Coffee Shop 38,SUPER CUTE place. Staff was really sweet and nice. Tried the chocolate and the almond macaroon. It was good! I had never had one before so this was a great place to have my first experience!,1
Coffee Shop 38,"Macarons were delightful and delicious. Airy and full or flavor. The lavender is strong, mimosa wasn't my favorite, rose was light on flavor, espresso was rich, strawberry was refreshing, and strawberry lemonade was playful. Would buy macarons from here again! Found you on a ""best of"" list! Mimosa, strawberry lemonade, strawberry, espresso, lavender, rose macarons!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Have been wanting to try this place for ages now, but never get around to it. Finally grew desperate and Postmate-d the CroBrio! The chocolate glazed one with peanut butter filling. AMAZING! Such a fluffy and smooth texture, gooey peanut butter (unlike the store bought PB), and the chocolate glazing was of course delicious. Really wish I had ordered two because they're not as big as the other Yelp pictures seem to display. Also coincidentally, I got it in Happy Hour so only $2.5 instead of $5! Could easily buy one everyday without boring my taste buds.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Such a cute little place!! Got hot coffee, iced coffees macaroons and croissants to share. All were great! Great service as well  TRY THE SALTED CARAMEL MACAROONS!!",1
Coffee Shop 38,I just discovered this place last week and I am absolutely infatuated with it. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly and sincere. I went in yesterday to pick up a croissant and coffee for my birthday breakfast and there was only one woman behind the counter. People kept coming in. I was absolutely impressed with the grace and politeness in how she handled being understaffed. She still managed to greet every group that came in and continued to help each person that approached the counter. Impeccable multitasking skills. That girl deserves a raise!,1
Coffee Shop 38,Updated review 2 check-ins Tried the crio brio aka austin's cronut. I get the choc covered. - its my first cronut so I'm not a connoisseur by any means but it was good. Not too sweet. Very nice lightly sweetened cream inside and the chocolate on top is not sweet at all. 1 was plenty- they're not super light.,1
Coffee Shop 38,"4 check-ins Would consider La Patisserie my local go to macaroon & pastry boutique for macaroons there.  I've been there several times to purchase macaroons to share and to have myself.  Feedback I've received were consistently good ones.  Homemade granola, croissants, coffee options are also exceptional.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Listed in All About Austin Super cute bakery with an awesome barista/cashier. Love the decorations--shabby chic overstuffed armchairs and mismatched black chairs, whimsical wall art, and soft muted colors.  Tried their lavender macaron and it was one of the best I've ever had. Chewy on the outside and delightfully creamy on the inside. Love, love, love.  The cortado, espresso cut with a small amount of milk (they offer cow, almond, and soy), was delicious. And prepared with such skill and patience by the business's lovely staff.  La Patisserie has a dedicated area for kiddos to play and eat, which is nice. Helps moms and dads who are looking for a bit of serenity in a most likely busy day.  Grab a cup of jo or a box of macarons to go, or sit here and leisurely sip on your beverage while studying.  Tip: Use your Yelp app to check in to get a free macaron!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"This little pastry shop was my first macaron encounter, and I was swooning. I don't have anything to compare them too but these made me happy.  They also have a decent pan au chocolat, although not my favorite ever. My friend got the cinnamon brioche bun and she was pleased. I tried it and wished i would have gotten that instead.  While you are there you can stop by the Austin postcard street art and take a photo! Fun first visit and I will probably be back. How adorable! Street sign Pan au chocolat, macarons, brioche bun, and coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 38,This is the cutest place in Austin for a coffee. Pastries are delicious ! The vibe is very quite ... I love it.,1
Coffee Shop 38,Updated review An update: The manager of the store reached out to me and offered a refund to fix the issue- so nice! I really appreciated the gesture and will be sure to be back. Their macarons really are the best.,1
Coffee Shop 38,Overpriced for something underwhelming :-/ Staff were nice though. Maybe I was just out of place but $5.50 for a donut shaped croissant that was chocolate covered is pretty steep. I figured it was going to be super tasty but it really wasn't. If someone wanted to make a little extra cash for really nothing they could buy HEB donuts for .58 and sell them from their trunk behind this place for 4.00 a piece and everyone would be a winner.,0
Coffee Shop 38,"2 check-ins Listed in 5 Stars, Truly Austin, FOR FOODIES... in Austin, Ambiance in Austin, Best Desserts in Austin The Crobrio was my sole reason for coming. Arrived Saturday around 11am and got the last few Crobrios left. Call ahead to make sure they have some if you live far out (so you don't make the trip for nothing). What is a crobrio?? ATX version of NYC's infamous Cronut (crossaint deep fried like a donut & stuffed with creamy custardy goodness).  I was afraid it wouldn't be good since it was sitting out & not freshly fried upon order. I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype & that my overpriced $5 donut would disappoint my tastebuds. But NOPE! It was delicious in taste & texture & the filling was perfect! I'm reviewing the cinnamon sugar since that's the only kind I got to try.  Check in with yelp to get 2 free mini macarons! I got the salted caramel & honestly, it's going to be on my birthday wishlist this year. I could eat a box of those! I liked the size: 2 bites! Texture was perfect! And the saltiness factor was perfect & not overdone. Will be back for more.  Also got the almond crossaint and got to try the savory crossaint (which was a huge hit amongst the 3men that we brought with us). Both did not disappoint- crispy on the outside & rich on the inside. $2-3/each.  Parking: street parking- please be considerate & don't block driveways!  Seating: a few small tables inside & 2 small tables outside (best to go with 1-2 friends)  Kid friendly- they have a small play area for infants/toddlers.  Bring cash or credit card (I THINK they have a $7 cc minimum but memory is a bit rusty)  Service: friendly, no complaints :) Baby play area Other goodies Macaron prices See all photos from Cynthia C. for La Patisserie",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I just can't resist a good macaroon. This place has one of the macaroons in Austin. They have such unique flavors such as cardamom honey orange, caramel flour de sel, and lavender. I can't help but to have a lighter wallet and a heavier belly every time I visit here. Taste the rainbow!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I don't know, if you're really into amazing things maybe give this place a shot. Had the cronut, immediately had to buy another one because it was that good. That coupled with witty banter and a great atmosphere makes this place the gem you've been looking for. You're welcome. If you're into wicked good food, go ahead.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I'm a hater and haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate. Sorry. Why do people like La Patisserie? Every thing I've ever had here was sub-par.  The macarons are all different shapes and sizes. The flavors aren't very distinct. When you take a bite, it's hard to tell with certainty what flavor you're eating. And why are practically all of them filled with cheap-tasting whipped cream? If you like the macarons here, you haven't tasted a truly good one. The frozen macarons from Trader Joe's are much better and cheaper.  The cakes are dryyyyyyy and the icing is hardened from sitting in the fridge for too long. I wouldn't be able to identify their cakes from a grocery store's in a blind taste test.  I feel badly about all this bashing, so I'll end the review on a more positive note. The house itself is super cute, and...yea, that's all I can come up with for now.",0
Coffee Shop 38,"2 check-ins I discovered this place through a Weekly Yelp awhile back when they had featured the Cro-Brio they serve up here (it's a brioche cronut and is what baked good dreams are made of!), so when a friend and I came in on a Wed only to find that the Cro-Brios only make an appearance on the weekend, we were heartbroken. But, the amazing gal behind the counter, Megan, made our day by telling us that they have a sort of croissant happy hour where if you buy a coffee beverage after 3pm, you get a croissant pastry for free! Sold!! Their plain croissant are flaky, buttery perfection and their almond versions are exquisite! Megan also told us that we can always call beforehand and they will put some Cro-Brios aside to be picked up as they tend to sell out, especially on Sat. mornings. She even took down my info so that I would have a couple of Cro-Brios waiting for me Sat. afternoon! So super kudos to Megan for turning our frowns upside-down!  I came around 3pm on Saturday and lo and behold my Cro-Brios were ready and waiting (I had confirmed w/Kristin, the gal working on Sat, over the phone) and Kristin could not have been nicer! She even gave a full macaron in lieu of 2-mini ones per the Yelp Check-In freebie since they were sold out. I went w/lavender and it was delicious!  I will definitely be spreading the Cro-Brio gospel and returning when I can to this adorable little bake shop on So-Fi! They do EXIST! The entrance Awesome See all photos from Leila R. for La Patisserie",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Is it macaroon or macaron? Either way, they were delicious. And it was my first time having them here too! I tried an assortment of flavors, each one didn't disappoint. I think my favorite was the lavender! The establishment is tiny and quiet, so it's not very good for accommodating groups, just fyi. I'll def be back to try their other goodies. pretty colors",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Conveniently located right next door to the Austin postcard!  Very yummy macrons & coffee. Came here twice on the same day just to get more for the road, that's how good it was. Saw a lot of students studying, the inside is charming, quiet, small, clean bathrooms and a small kids play area. I'm sure I'll be back, I'm a sucker for those cute little macrons! Pistachio Chocolate espresso & almond macarons. Yum!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"2 check-ins The vibe was really cool i felt like I was in Paris with the setting and the music, cool and quite place. Macarron",1
Coffee Shop 38,"As soon as you walk in La Pâtisserie, you can't help but feel at home.  The bakery is small but is so cozy and charming.  We love the atmosphere of eating a wonderful pastry while sitting in one of the tables.    Been here several times now and get the crobrio each time.  It is our absolute favorite and is incredibly addicting!  When you take a bite of their crobrio,  the cinnamon sugar really enhances the pastry.  The sugary dough provides just the right sweetness,  while the custardy filling blows your mind.  The dough itself is dense,  but soft and not dry at all.  The dough is dense to complement the custard filling.  We usually buy a few to bring home and even a day or two after (it doesn't last too long at our house),  it still tastes great,  and the dough is still soft and pillowy.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the coffee is not that great in our opinion.  We've ordered the cappuccino twice now,  and feel it tastes more like milk,  and isn't strong enough.  It's not make or break,  but a good pastry is better appreciated with good coffee.  We will still come back and just get coffee elsewhere. Crobrio is the absolute best!!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"This place is okay. It is a very small coffee and pastry shop. If you are in the area then give it a try, but I would not drive out of your way to get there.  The pastry selection is limited. I purchased 1/2 a dozen of macarons samplers. It was okay - sugary sweet and will go well with coffee.",0
Coffee Shop 38,Such a cute little bakery with the most intriguing macaron flavors and the kindest baristas.,1
Coffee Shop 38,"7 check-ins The perfect place to satisfy a craving for something sweet. They make the best cakes I have ever had! Personally, I really dislike overly sweet desserts, but all of the cakes that I have tried are perfectly moist and balanced in terms of sweetness and flavor. My top three favorites are:  - Opera Cake, a nice personal-sized cake with a coffee flavored cream inside.  - Chocolate Hazelnut Cake which is FULL of chopped up hazelnuts, so you can really taste the flavor. Not to mention, it's gluten-free, which really surprised me when I found out, because it tastes great.  - Lemon Blackberry Buttercream Meringue Cake. This one is my absolute favorite, but it is only available in the Spring, since their cakes are seasonal. BUT IT'S SO GOOD.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Yum!  We ordered a group lunch delivered to our office today. The sandwich variety was well-received and I can personally attest to the tastiness of the rosemary cream cheese croissant sandwich. I heard several compliments toward the turkey and chicken salad croissant sandwiches as well.  I took a look at their website and noticed there did not seem to be a call-out on the actual Menu tab for sandwiches? It seems you need to click on the foodee link at the bottom to see that they can deliver more than just pastries and desserts for lunches. This isn't a big deal, as they are a ""macaron and pastry boutique."" However, I think potential patrons could be missing out that they serve some delicious croissant sandwiches!  Eh, more for moi.  ;)",1
Coffee Shop 38,This place is amazing! I've never had one pastry or drink I didn't absolutely die for! I would come here more because the vibe is great and the people who work here are even more great but the wifi is TERRIBLE! I mean TERRIBLE! Get your macaroons and hang out for a bit and hope you can log into someone else wifi!,1
Coffee Shop 38,"One of my favorite places to grab a gift for someone or a quick treat for myself. Theres usually a really good selection, especially earlier in the day. I love that they change the macaron flavors seasonally too, makes it fun to keep trying it out!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"everything about this place was great.  the person who helped me out was so nice.  I bought a couple of slices of king cake (cinnammon roll style cake), SOOOO good!  Got a couple of eclairs as well, and those were amazing.  Going to be frequenting this place more when I need a quick dose of something delicious paired with a coffee.",1

Coffee Shop 38,"I went with a friend on a sunday afternoon- they do a croissant based half-off deal until close, so that was awesome!  The macarons were great, we both tried a variety of their flavors. The coffee was delicious, and the atmosphere was adorable. The young woman helping us was kind and patient.  Can't wait to go back!",1
Coffee Shop 38,I come here for the flourless hazelnut chocolate cake. Nobody makes cake like this!!  We typically come at the end of the day and since La Patisserie closes at 5 our selection is always limited. I've also had their macaroons which have the perfect texture and flavor.  The atmosphere is girly and cute. Perfect for a meet up with your girlfriends. There aren't many tables but I've never seen it packed. Most people grab their sweets to go.  There's plenty of street parking outside. Take a picture with the Austin postcard street art afterwards too!,1
Coffee Shop 38,"Wonderful little bakery oozing with South Austin charm and bursting with fabulous french pastries. All you really need to know about the quality of their pastries...their macaroons beat LA DURÉE in both Paris and NYC. Keep it up, la patisserie!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I really wanted to like this place...  Items I've tried at la patisserie: pop tart, blueberry/cream cheese croissant, paris brest, a coffee macaron, and their famous CroBrio.  While nothing here was terrible, I wouldn't get any of them again. I can find better and more delicious ways to ingest calories in a great food town like Austin. All the stuff here looks pretty legit. But it was just very underwhelming. Lacking flavor. Lacking sweetness. Lacking texture.  The people working Austin real friendly and helpful at least.  Maybe they just arent my cup of tea. Maybe my palette sucks, who knows. Either way, I won't be returning.",0
Coffee Shop 38,Updated reviewService was much better this time! Macarons are still amazing. The lavender macaron is my favorite thing on earth.,1
Coffee Shop 38,"This place is really legit. I've yet to have a macaron as delicious and flavorful as I've had at this bakery. The cardamom, lavender, and pistachio flavors are so unique - in a good, must have sense! I've sampled a few other pastries that were tasty, but the macarons are what makes this place special.  The only thing I'd suggest - the coffee quality could be upped, but I can't really complain - Le Patisserie is on it's game with their French pastry selection!  Also - if you're looking for the 'Greetings from Austin' mural, it's practically next door. Austin mural is practically next door to La Patisserie Macaron pack of deliciousness",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Amazing macaroons and love their gluten free choices, the cranberry pecan muffin was the most amazing thing I have ever had. Go at an odd time or before a rush hits, if you get there later in the day you'll find yourself standing in a very long line and nothing will be left by the time its your turn to order.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I feel that I give this place  little more credit for its location and coziness. It's not a place that has a great selection. They are good at what they do, however I  usually prefer items on the menu that are unique in a way that you wouldn't find it anywhere else. Overall, a good place to sit and talk with a friend.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Listed in after eats La Patisserie is a cute little house (I guess you would call this a cafe?) that has some tasty-looking pastries, but all I've tried is their macarons and their coffee.  Step one: avoid the coffee. I would rather go to Starbucks to get coffee than buy coffee here again, and even so, there are plenty of other local coffee businesses in Austin that serve better coffee. They are not known for their coffee--and with that, I just don't see the point in wasting your money on something they don't really even know how to brew. Honestly, my latte tasted like foam on top of cardboard-like coffee.  It wasn't that appetizing.  On another note, I liked the macarons! I would definitely come back for them again. The first time I came there, they were completely sold out! I came around four or five o'clock, and it was such a bummer--so just be careful of the time you go!  The second time, I got three different flavors: Sea Salt Caramel, Espresso, and S'mores. They were all a littleee on the sweet side, but I didn't mind it too much. The texture in them wasn't as soft as they should have been--they were a bit too chewy for a straight up, good macaron, but they were still good.  I would definitely come back, and next time try the cronut! I heard those were tasty.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"4 check-ins Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge in 2014...COMPLETED, For Out-of-Towners What a darling little gem. Their macarons are fresh, delicate and delicious in a variety of flavors, including seasonal ones, and they are reasonably priced. My friend from Houston likes to buy a dozen of these each time she visits. They're really some of the best macarons around. La Patisserie has a few pastries and quiches too, but the macarons are the main attraction. This place has been in business for a few years and they know what they are doing.  If you want macarons, especially on the weekend, head here early (before noon) because they sell out fast!  The interior is intimate but tasteful. I can't think of a happier place to enjoy a sweet treat and cup of coffee or tea with a friend.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Is this a vegan place? Croissant had no butter taste, but a rather off taste I can't put my finger on (just pure shortening?) They also look squat and failed to raise enough.  Morning bun was much better since it's coated in sugar. Very nice service located in a very cute house.",0
Coffee Shop 38,Check in on yelp for a free macaron!,1
Coffee Shop 38,"When I moved into the neighborhood, I was overjoyed to find this little French bakery. I tried it out to see how it compared to the baked goods I was used to eating in Dallas, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I've had from here has been so good! I stopped in one morning and got cinnamon rolls and ham & cheese croissants for my family and everyone raved about them.  The staff is SUPER friendly and nice, I always feel welcomed and like they're glad I'm there.  If you go in later in the day, they always have some pastries on sale! I recommend signing up for their newsletter to stay on the inside with events and special deals.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I don't love the coffee - I thought it could be a little better. Ice tea is great, though. Definitely bump this place up on your list of places to check out.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I had a crobrio and it was very good! It's not quite like a cronut but has a similar vibe. I like the location of this bakery - they even have a kid's play area which I can imagine would be nice if I had little kids. The staff were very friendly and this seems like a great, quiet spot to post up and do some homework or read a book.",1
Coffee Shop 38,Always friendly staff and super delicious Macarons! Recommend trying rose and lavender!,1
Coffee Shop 38,"This place is in a house to it is easy to miss if you aren't looking carefully. That donut thing they sell is interesting but I wouldn't eat it again lol. Their macarons are good though, I always get lavender everywhere. It was chewy and yummy (I hate crunchy ones). Their macarons do look different since the shells are bumpy instead of smooth",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Updated review Listed in Second breakfasts and Elevenses Still love the pastries here. But, I'm beginning to take issue with the quality of the barista. Cappuccinos are never consistent. Too hot, too cold, too light. The last time i went in and asked for a single cap, I heard the barista checking with the cashier if that meant one shot. Then I got my single cap in a giant cup (about 20 oz). Aaaaaargh! 7 oz for single, please.  On a different note, the main room is crowded with the oversized 4-top table, and the secondary room with the kid play area is only large enough for 2-3 ppl the way the seats are set up. It is going to be hard to get my family to come back here :/  They remain 4 stars for good pastries and friendly service.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"Best macaroons ever!!! Very cute & quaint, great place for a cappuccino and a sugar rush :)",1
Coffee Shop 38,"3 check-ins It's hard to write about this place without echoing what everyone else has already said. ""It's in a cute, cozy house!"" ""The macarons are divine!"" ""Try the lavender and pistachio!"" ""The coffee drinks are phenomenal."" Yep, I feel the exact same way. The space is truly small, so I can imagine it gets crammed during peak hours. All of the desserts look amazing, and I'm really keen to try the savory croissants.  Pro-tip: They currently have a Paypal deal ($5 off) and a Yelp deal (2 free mini-macarons when you purchase $7 or more).",1
Coffee Shop 38,Listed in 36 Hours in Austin The staff are really friendly and the prices are so reasonable for macarons and loose leaf tea. Nice and calm ambience with comfy armchairs. Pistachio and lavender macarons,1
Coffee Shop 38,"7 check-ins Stopped by La Patisserie to grab a couple macaroons this morning and they were amazing! Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. They even have a little play area for children if you decide to take them here! Prices were decent and if you check in on yelp, you get 2 free mini macaroons!",1
Coffee Shop 38,This little sweet shop was super adorable. We parked behind the shop and walked our way to the front entrance. Inside were little tables and ahead of us was the display case with all the sweets!  Today I tried the Chocolate Espresso and Rose macarons. These were some of the best I've tried. I definitely recommend both. The texture of them were pretty on point. Very soft.  Great place! I want to come back and try everything! Chocolate Espresso and Rose flavored macarons.,1
Coffee Shop 38,"Great macaroon, crobrio things were soooo dank and delish.  I was in there with my mother, and the cute woman behind the counter was very nice.  I love the decor and outdoor seating as well!",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I can now say that I have tried the Cronut. Well, the CroBrio. After saying that people eagerly await for your opinion on how it tastes and if it lives up to the hype. It does not. Sorry to disappoint kiddos, but honestly, it tastes like a stale, day old donut that was left uncovered in the kitchen. Maybe I need to try the real thing, but this imitation left much to be desired. Like freshness.  Thanks to a Yelp! coupon I was able to try a mini macaroon, but even that wasn't great. Though I am not a macaroon person so asking me to like it was a stretch.  There are plenty of places to get dessert in Austin, and I honestly wouldn't suggest this be one of your places.",0
Coffee Shop 38,"2 check-ins La patisserie has a nice selection of pastries, cookies and cake. Our favorite is the hazelnut chocolate. Hands down the primary reason we come here.  Plenty of seating and water available. Very comfortable and good place to meet up for a relaxing lunch or coffee.  The employees are helpful and very knowledgeable about their food.  If you have guests in town stop by the Austin postcard outside for a picture.",1
Coffee Shop 38,"I think I almost cried when they only had like two macarons left after I stopped in before heading back to Dallas. Lavender and pistachio are probably my favorites; followed by the vanilla.  They have phenomenal flavorful macarons. The right amount of outer crispness collapses into cakey softness, which leads to a delicious filling. The entire pastry is full of flavor. I have tasted many macarons where the pastry flavor is dull or the filling flavor gets lost.  If you're in Austin you should definitely stop in and preorder if you want to be sure you get them. (FYI - if you preorder and don't make it in when you said you were going to, make sure you call them. They will sell your macarons to desperate macaron lovers like me. :-p)",1
Coffee Shop 38,Listed in 100 yelp challenge! 2013 reviews I stopped by when I visited Austin for a weekend. I saw this place from other Yelpers checking in. I got one french macarons of each flavors. They were delish!!!! they were exactly how it should be. Crunchy outside and soft inside. You get one or two mini macaroons for checking in. Sometimes they run out so don't always expect it. Service was great and friendly. This is such a cozy cute place. I see myself spending time here on my next visit! Delicious!!!!,1
Coffee Shop 38,"La Patisserie was one of the first food places I went to when I moved to Austin back in February. It showed so much promise - good reviews on Yelp, cute, homey exterior and interior decor, friendly staff, inviting atmosphere, delicious looking pastries.  I ordered a cappuccino and it was, well, pretty awful. It had that spongy foam a la Starbucks. In other words, there are no professional baristas working here. The pastries were, meh, just okay. I can't even remember what I got the first time I came.  Second and third trip to La Patisserie (over the course of 6 months), I tried more pastries, but learned my lesson from last time that the coffee drinks were not good, so opted out of that. I came to the conclusion that the pastries are way too sugary sweet and quite amateur.  Despite the nice atmosphere, I don't think I'll be back. There are just so many other good places to choose from in this town.",0
Coffee Shop 48,My sweet Austin is such a wonderful place to go to I came in they were immediately to take my order they have such a great vibe to the place I just want you it just makes you want to stay there forever everything is so tasty I have never had anything that I don't like it's a super great place I would recommend it a million times over and over..,1
Coffee Shop 48,"I contacted Sara a week before I needed a cake thinking it was too last minute. She's a total rockstar and accommodated me with a custom cake for my boyfriend's surprise birthday party! It was a very smooth and easy transaction. I sent her some pictures of the dogs and picked a flavor. When I went in to pick it up it was probably the cutest cake I've ever seen in my life. The cake was Chocolate Salted Caramel and it was absolutely delicious! Very moist and balanced in flavor, not too sweet which is perfect. The cake was such a hit people were taking home slices after the party. Thank you so much!! I can't wait to make future orders with y'all. The after math (no dogs consumed any chocolate) See all photos from Jess A. for My Sweet Austin",1
Coffee Shop 48,"We eat a lot of cupcakes at work. So we consider ourselves to be a bit snobbish when it comes to cupcakes.  These delicate morsels are wonderful. Moist and flavorful with creamy, not-too-sweet frosting.  The lemon touched with a kiss of raspberry is exceptional!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"Thank you so much for making our wedding cakes!  All three were delicious, with the cookies and cream being the most popular.  Y'all were so easy to work with, accommodating, and truly go above and beyond for your customers.  We will be back again and again!",1
Coffee Shop 48,EXCELLENT QUALITY & SERVICE! I called last minute to see if they had cakes left that were already made so I could stop and buy one for my daughters bday. Hillary was super helpful she told me they didnt but she was going to help me out. Within an hour she prepared a cake for my daughter and it was delicious! Of course we had to tried the cupcakes while we were waiting and I have to say YUMMMM!!!,1
Coffee Shop 48,"All I can say is PERFECTION! We showed up 3 wks before our son's 8th birthday after viewing several Yelp reviews on other local bakeries. A perfectionist myself, I was happy to find out Sara was a perfectionist when it came to her cakes. She was very nice through the process and made sure to write down all of my ideas and thoughts for the cake.  We picked up our cake the morning of the party and were amazed at how the cake Sara made looked exactly like the picture we showed her weeks before! We received SO MANY compliments on the cake and my son loved it! :) Our cake flavors were cookies and cream and the top tier confetti---they tasted great! I couldn't have asked for anything better for my son! I'll be sending all of my friends and family to My Sweet Austin! Thanks Sara! :)  P.S. The day we ordered our cake, we tried the assortment of flavors available in cupcakes and the strawberry flavored icing is so good! It has real strawberry pieces in the icing and tastes so fresh. The coconut cupcake was also very moist and loved every bit of the coconut flakes. Both are a must if you stop by! The Nightmare Before Christmas :)",1
Coffee Shop 48,"They make probably the best tasting and definitely the best looking cakes in Austin. Sara, the owner has a really talent for crafting. I've ordered several cakes from them and also cookies and have never been disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 48,"We had a celebration at work, and they brought in 2 large sheetcakes from My Sweet Austin. One was red velvet with vanilla icing, and the other was vanilla cake with vanilla icing. I didn't try the red velvet, but I had a piece of the vanilla cake and I can't believe a professional bakery like this could have such terrible cake. The cake itself was super dry and crumbly, so much that I could barely even pick it up with a fork because it just kept crumbling off. The icing was just a very basic 'american buttercream' consisting of vegetable shortening and powdered sugar - bland, and left a greasy feel in my mouth. Many of my coworkers also said the cake would have tasted better had it been ordered from HEB. I looked at the picture gallery on My Sweet Austin's website and they really do some beautiful cakes but, in my opinion, it doesn't matter how great it looks on the outside if the cake and icing itself is horrible.",0
Coffee Shop 48,Amazing place! We were visiting from out of town on Friday afternoon and we urgently needed a birthday cake for our friend. Although you typically have to pre-order the girls realized that we don't have a car and actually volunteered to make the cake for us right away. 45 minutes we had our completely fresh and delicious cake in our hands. Awesome job!,1
Coffee Shop 48,"Cute, little bakery with yummy desserts. The butterscotch-pecan Blondie bar is a very generous portion and super moist. Not a huge selection of items, but very high quality.",1
Coffee Shop 48,"Unfortunately, after driving 20 minutes to get here on a Saturday afternoon, expressly to pick up a couple cupcakes for a spur of the moment birthday celebration, I arrived to discover they have NO CUPCAKES. Bad timing on my part I suppose, but...WOW, REALLY??? And there's NOWHERE to park here, either.",0
Coffee Shop 48,"This bakery is very cute and small which is perfect in West campus. I actually ordered cupcakes and asked to pick up on a Sunday which is when they're usually closed. The owner never mentioned to me that she is usually closed and agreed to my pick up date. How sweet is she to compensate my pick up date! The cupcakes were good and frosting was a little lighter than the other bakeries I have tried. I think everything was great, but I only took a star off because one of my little fondant designs started bending and fell before the cupcakes got into my apartment. I had to stick a toothpick behind it to hold up that heart piece. It could be that it was a bigger heart with the word anniversary on it so it did not get to harden as fast as the other hearts. Overall Sara is a very nice person and was very patient! One of the hearts fell and I had to put a toothpick behind it to hold it in place.",1
Coffee Shop 48,"Dulce de leche cake was excellent. The frosting was sweet but not cloying. The sponge was moist. Everyone enjoyed the cake, children and adults alike. The owner worked with me on selecting a cake flavor that was okay for a child with some specific food intolerances, too. We were very pleased with this cake, will order from My Sweet Austin again, and recommend to friends. Thx!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"Sara is amazing! She make a cake for our wedding and not only was it STUNNING, but it was also delicious! She is very professional and made our cake exactly as we had discussed.

Coffee Shop 48,Sara did my one year old's smash cake and cupcakes for her 1 year birthday- it was PERFECT! The smash cake had sprinkles all over it and was just precious. We had the funfetti cake with ganash- holy moly it was so good! We will be using them again!  I have also had the pleasure of trying her muffins (the banana bread one)- so yummy!!  She is talented and great at what she does!,1

Coffee Shop 48,"First to Review Best.Wedding.Cake.EVER.  I know that everyone says that their wedding cake was the best, but I truly believe that mine was! Sara is very professional, we met many months in advance of the wedding, tasted the yummy cakes and came up with a mock-up of the cake. The Groom and I threw out some ideas, something nature looking and outdoorsy that also captures our personaility. Ok, yes .... that's a little bit difficult to grasp, but My Sweet Austin had not problem making the most amazing cake ever!  On ""the big day"" I was more than pleasantly surprised and everyone loved the cake. There were pictures of the cake up on Facebook before anything else at the wedding. Not only was this cake incredibly creative, it was out-of-this-world delicious!  If you're looking for a custom cake for any event, My Sweet Austin is the place to go! Anyone who saw the cake toppers LOVED them. See all photos from Jamie K. for My Sweet Austin",1
Coffee Shop 48,"I ordered from Sara for a baby shower I was hosting and she did an AMAZING job!! First of all, she is quick to reply and very professional. I sent her a picture of the cake I wanted and she made it perfect plus some additional cute decorations that made it very special! She also did a dozen cake pops (the mommy to be LOVES cake pops) and they came out so perfect too! I love how she put special touches on everything. Not only did the cake and cake pops turn out beautiful, but they were SO GOOD! Everyone at the party was asking where they were ordered from. I highly recommend My Sweet Austin! You will not be disappointed! :) Rosette cake for baby shower with edible pearls!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"I ordered a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and requested to have a picture that I supplied put onto the cake. She was very up front with the cost (which was totally affordable and amazing) and accommodating. The cake was delicious and everyone wanted to know where I had it made. I asked for the exact same estimate at another bake shop and was given a price $100 more at the other shop simply because the picture would be edible (at My Sweet Austin, she was unable to do an edible photo) but I would totally take a non-edible photo and save $100 over the other option ANY DAY. Also, now, my boyfriend and I have the photo from the cake which we've kept as a keepsake and put on our fridge. Love this bakery and will totally return for the next cake that I need.",1
Coffee Shop 48,"I ordered a cake for my daughter's 21st birthday party. I gave short notice but Sara was able to bake it for when I needed it. I also have a picture of what I wanted and I have to say, the cake was to the T. Our guest were really impressed!! So was my daughter. The cake was delicious! I will definitely recommend and will use Sara for future cake needs. Thank you Sara for a wonderful cake. I wish I could post a picture of it. I was too pretty to cut, my daughter and I hesitated to cut it. But had to.",1
Coffee Shop 48,"My Sweet Austin is as good as it gets when it comes to desserts.   My husband and I hired Sara to make our wedding cake for our summer wedding.  We wanted a cake that fit with the theme of our wedding but we really didn't have any specific design in mind.  Sara came up with a design and hit it out of the park.  It was truly beautiful - simple, elegant and classy.  Many of our guests commented on how lovely the cake was and just as important, how tasty it was!   The fondant was really good and the cake itself was moist and flavorful.  I've eaten a lot of wedding cakes over the years, and Sara's cake tops the list.  Sara is a true artist and it really shows in the detail of her work.  She is also one of the nicest people to work with and it is obvious that she truly cares about her clients.  I'm so glad we hired My Sweet Austin to make our cake!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"Sara made the most beautiful Hollywood cake for our daughters Bat Mitzvah this weekend.  Every guest commented on how amazing the cake looked, and I can honestly say it was the best tasting cake we have ever had.  Amazing job!   Thank you Sara!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"A friend of mine recommended I check out My Sweet Austin for my mom's birthday cake. I wanted something unique because last years cake was dry. (Made it myself). After being wowed by the photos on the website, I was sold. I chose the lemon raspberry (going out on a limb with something different) and my whole family went crazy over it! For once we finished a cake. Sara did an awesome job on matching my thoughts for the style and was reasonably priced. Definitely worth it! I'll be placing another order for my sister's baby shower soon.",1
Coffee Shop 48,Yummy!  Delicious and amazing cupcakes!,1
Coffee Shop 48,Sara made the cutest baby shower cake and cupcakes this past weekend.  It was perfect.  She and I had communicated on-line and Sara did exactly as we had discussed and then some.  She is very professional and the cake and cupcakes were beautiful and tasted amazing.  I found Sara based off the reviews posted and they are all 100% accurate.  I'm grateful for everyone's insight that lead me to email Sara initially.,1
Coffee Shop 48,"I absolutely loved my bridal cake! It was exactly like what I envisioned, and the flavors were amazing. The bridal cake was half citrus coconut, half passionfruit raspberry, and the groom's cake was a chocolate Guinness cake.  I didn't even get to try the groom's cake she made because it was so wildly popular. Sara is so pleasant and easy to work with, which made the experience even better. Her prices are also very reasonable. I called and did tastings at several bakeries in the area, and she matched or beat most of their prices while also beating them out on flavor. I highly recommend My Sweet Austin!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"Sara did a wonderful job on a very elaborate birthday cake for my son's first birthday and not only did it turn out beautiful, it was just as delicious!

I can't recommend her services enough!",1
Coffee Shop 48,"I found out about My Sweet Austin by purchasing a Living Social deal.  Sara was super responsive, and the whole transaction was so easy.  These days you never know what to expect from people, and I was so happy with Sara's professionalism and flawless delivery of a yummy product.  My cupcakes were done on time, packaged well and so cute.  The cake and ganache were delicious, and the ganache was a fun addition to the cupcake.  The frosting was different than normal - not cream cheese or buttercream - it was like dense whipped cream.  It taked like she used real strawberries, so the taste was really fresh, but I still prefer buttercream frosting : )  5 stars for a flawless process!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"This place is great!! It's in joint with the Grove. It's a classy type of restaurant so of course the adjacent cafe was just as nice! I only read off of the menu on the wall so make sure you look at the menu taped onto the register! It has way more variety. I ordered a chai latte and asked for extra chai and it was relatively ok, still tasted like it could use some more flavoring but the taste was good and the sweetness was on point! I think next time I will try the white mocha with raspberry(:  It was very clean and service was very prompt! I came in on Sunday around 4pm so it was empty and quiet, a great time for an intimate date(: There's some seating inside as well as outside!  Note: you don't need to have the host seat you if you're going to the cafe portion only, go in and seat yourself!",1
Coffee Shop 42,"Lola Savannah is inside The Grove, which I also love. Lola's chai tea lattes are the best I've ever had. I cannot rave enough about their drinks. Every time I go I'm so impressed by their quality. I had a chai tea latte at Irene's and it can't even compare to Lola. Try their lattes and I would recommend the brunch at the grove!!",1
Coffee Shop 42,Updated review 42 check-ins They have changed the brunch menu! Added lobster mac & cheese and chili and egg (venison chili). Can't wait to try. Coffee still Bueno with great art and design to boot. Excellent addition to downtown. A little Potter at Lola Savannah. Mother's Day coffee homage......or Andy Warhol. Take your pick but drop by for a Mother's Day treat nonetheless.,1
Coffee Shop 42,"3 check-ins The baristas are always really nice and skilled at making whatever drink strikes your fancy. It's one of the only coffee shops on the west side of downtown unless you want to go to Starbucks and you won't want to after you have the coffee here. It's very smooth, not sour or bitter. If you really need to wake up try Shots In The Dark, a black coffee with 2 shots of espresso. Lola is inside The Grove wine bar in case you are having trouble finding it and wandering around outside the building like I did the first time. Lola is a great pick if you're with a group where some people want to drink alcohol and others don't!",1
Coffee Shop 74,I learned of this location from a friend when I was looking for a coffee shop with a nice couch.  I was having a coffee date with a few friends and we wanted to be comfortable.  We arrived to find we were the only ones out on the patio.  We arranged the couch so we had a beautiful view of the sunset while being able to enjoy each others company in a somewhat romantic fashion.    The location is inside a gas station but don't be fooled.  Go out back and enjoy the scenery on the outdoor balcony with the leather couch and small intimate tables.,1
Coffee Shop 74,"Always helpful, very quick arrival time counter and extremely nice outside sitting area but gas lines can be kinda long.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Who woulda thunk this little gem was hiding out right off of 360!  Apparently they brought back the comfy seating and great atmosphere.  You're not allowed to drink beer or wine on the balcony, but we settled for a lovely chai tea and hot chocolate (it' was summer time but we're silly kids).  Anywho, the main convenience store is open until midnight, or 11? It's got quite a variety of wines and several ciders and beer. The coffee shop is open until about 7 in the summer. The outside porch doesn't really have any fans (they're really slow) but it's still a wonderful place to watch the sunset.  I can't wait to cuddle up with a warm drink when it gets chilly outside. :) :)",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Convenience store with Austin Java, 30 different types of beer and a larger wine selection than most grocery stores?  You know you're in Westlake...",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Updated review Bad experience #141, prompting another review.  I work in the area and visit this store a few times a week.  The convenience store portion is full of passive aggressive employees (who can blame them right, they deal with Westlake people and people who work on the HOMES of Westlake people all day).  1.)  POS selections don't work properly, if you select Debit/Credit before the cashier has a chance to ask you if you'd like Credit/Debit the transaction fails and they become even more unhappy with their lives, except now it's your fault.  2.)  Even if the POS works properly, you'll probably receive an obligatory snipe from your hispanic cashier as you finish your transaction, just to make sure you know they hate serving you (I suspect this is just a racism thing, again I blame the location).  Long story short, if you're in a tolerant mood, get in and out quickly.  If you're in a homicidal mood, it's probably best to wait for the next gas station, it's the only one out here and they know you don't have any other options.",0
Coffee Shop 74,"3 check-ins ROTD ""Let's meet at this gas station I love."" she said.    We scratched our heads.  It was a glorious day, there are hundreds of outdoor patio options in town at which to meet, why on earth would she suggest a gas station?  Nevertheless, it was close to our home, we were fired up to meet and discuss the next steps in the rebuilding of our home/lives, and we always look forward to her company, so we ventured out.  Holy crap.  It IS the most unreal gas station / convenience store in Austin, perhaps the country.  Walk past the racks of ""like new"" golf balls and bags of pork rinds, to find a wonderfully secluded, spacious covered patio overlooking the Texas hills.  Facing west, no less, perfect for relaxing and watching the big gas ball wane.  We sat on comfy couches and chairs, almost alone the entire time, viewing plans, drawings, and schedules.  Reasonably priced glasses of wine kept appearing with regularity.    We ended up calling friends and telling them they HAD to come see this gas station.  Their reaction over the phone was much as ours had been, and likewise, upon arriving they had their ""holy crap"" moment.  Staying until the darkness had come, we decided that Tuscany at 360 needs to be on our list of sunset spots for visitors.  No more grumbling visits to that paean to excess and crap food named the Oasis.  This place is close, has a spectacular view, and the people who run it are nice.    A finer late afternoon I cannot imagine. Sunset on the patio of Tuscany @ 360",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Tuscany is closed... And under construction or something. Now, it's the Austin Java on the patio. Come in through the convince store and you will see it. It's wonderful on a cloudy day. Patio is still here.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"The coffee/tea/wine selection is good to great. The attendants in the store and cafe are friendly and attentive. The fly in the ointment is the parking and getting in and out for gas. It can be a tad tight and because of the beautiful view and convient location off of 360, people like to meet here.  This makes parking a bear!!!",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Sometimes on a hot summer afternoon I just have to have a coke slurpee.  So today we were on our way home driving on 360, and stopped in at Tuscany just to see if they had them.  I told my husband I'd always been curious about this place anyway, as there are always cars out front. Not only did they have coke slurpees, but the nice cashier told us about the great deck out back, and said that during football season they show the games on the television screens out there.  Wow--what a view! The little cafe had the basics, but it looks like a great place to be for a light breakfast on a cool morning, or for a glass of wine on a warm evening.  We definitely plan to return!",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Updated review Listed in Vertebra three sixty, Good Carma Bad Carma What I have seen here:  1.  They have their liquor license, and they are using it:  I was served a glass of wine while sitting on the back deck enjoying free wi-fi and the million dollar view.  By far the best ""bar"" that is not a bar.    2.  Gas prices are down, and this includes my favorite gas station:  1/05/09 update: 1.499 Regular 1.649 Plus 1.799 V-Power 2.199 Diesel  3.199 Regular 3.359 Plus 3.499 V-Power 3.759 Diesel  3.  The large back deck with the million dollar view is a great place for large gatherings.  Seating for 34:  Boyscout troop #1234 came to listen to a presentation by their troop leaders.  About 20 boys and about 3 leaders and then 6-7 other parents. I was sitting inside watching them and i felt sorry for the gay one.  He thought he was in hog heaven.  4.  A big smile on my parent's face as they walked through the doors to the million dollar view at 9:00 at night. with a glass of wine in their hands.  and they thought we stopped for gas.  5.  A women's book club meeting (about 12) all seated around a large table and drinking wine.  What I have not seen here:  1.  Real food.  How about an Italian meal served with a glass of wine?  2.  Any semblance of respect for the original architect's design: retail has indeed taken over.  The steel metro shelving appears cheap and temporary and it is the first thing you see upon entering.  Initially, they had the front doors open to a wall fountain across the room, however, this axis has been abandoned for a metal shelf full of fig newtons and Big Jims.  3.  New signage:  Seattle's Best is going to become Austin's Best or somesuch alteration that has us embrace the local coffee shop.  Here's a toast... to Hog Heaven!",1
Coffee Shop 74,"3 check-ins One of my new favorite perches to work from. If you're looking for a good latte and a cozy spot to settle in for awhile, this works. The pastries come in fresh every night, so if there's not much left you got there too late! Rolling hills view from the huge Italian-tiled deck, two large screen TVs outside, comfortable  tables and sofas. There's not much room inside for bad weather lap-topping and it doesn't have the keep-it-weird funk I crave for coffee shop inspiration, but how can you say no to this view? (see pictures) There's a drive-through if you're in a hurry, and they have wine tastings - ask to sign up and they'll send you the dates.  Update Nov 2o12: Tuscany no longer serves wine in the coffee shop or on the balcony.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Espresso: very good at its best, but inconsistent; latte microfoam could use some work  Wi-fi: very good  Outlets: good  Seating: very good comfortable chairs and tables  Cafe: quite nice pseudo-Tuscan feel, with indoor and semi-outdoor seating; beautiful views!  Baristi: very friendly and competent, but I'm not a fan of the push-button automatic espresso machines (a la 'Bucks)  Notes: yes, it's a gas station/convenience store, but if you're looking for wonderful views of Austin hillsides and forests, with a clean workspace, this is a great choice",1
Coffee Shop 74,"My first visit here involved a complicated order of an apple pie loaf, a double, espresso, and a glass of pinot.  The apple pie loaf was a bit disappointing, but the espresso and the pinot were both just fine.  The view from the back patio is stunning.  On my way out, I bought a couple scratch off lotto tickets.  I didn't win.  Truly, this is the best cafe-bar-gas station I've ever been to.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Tonight, I had a great experience at this coffee shop and store. It was 5 min. before the coffee shop was closed and Billy, the barista, greeted me like I was the first customer of the day. I ask if they were still open and without hesitation he said ""Sure, what can I get you."" I ordered, ""An iced, caramel awesome caffeinated beverage."" Billy was more than happy to make it up quick and it was absolutely the best iced coffee I've ever had. As he described, it tasted like the caramel candies I used to eat as a kid.  Will go back!  And the gentleman working the register in the ""Wag-a-bag"" portion of the store was equally as outstanding.",1
Coffee Shop 74,Wine tasting event.  12 wines + appetizers + great patio + good friends = $10  Best combo gas station/convenience store/coffee shop/wine bar in all of Austin.  Need I say more?,1
Coffee Shop 74,"This is a very preliminary two star, down from four. This morning (12/3/11) when I came in for breakfast and chai, I found that the new owners removed all the great furniture on the back patio as well as inside that has made this such a great place to hang out. Instead, there are a few cheap-looking and less comfortable tables and chairs. I hope they have something much better than this planned for the long term, or they're going to see a rapid drop in business.",0
Coffee Shop 74,"I was looking for some caffeine, and a view while I did some studying, and Tuscany at 360 delivered.  I was not expecting a gas station to be this nice. The coffee was decent, better than your average gas station. But on a day with nice weather, the patio is a great place to hang out.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"I got a tall black coffee, tall double vanilla latte, and a breakfast taco for about $6.50. BEAT THAT STARBUCKS!  I went through the drive-thru. Easy, prompt, pleasant experience. My taco (egg, cheese, and potato) wasn't that great, but I ate the whole thing nonetheless.  On Fridays they give you an extra shot for free. :)",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Completely love this place!  My perfect pit stop after dropping my son off at school and heading off to work.  Since the downturn in the economy I started making my coffee at home or occasionally stopping at McDonalds for a  McCafe Mocha (I know I know...not exactly the best espresso).  But since finding this place I'm back to my $4/day coffee...much to my husband shagrin.  Coffee/espresso is great!, yummy muffins and breakfast tacos, comfortable seating, the most splendid view from the patio ever...I just love sipping my coffee or wine while looking out over the Texas Hill Country.  Everything is great about this place!...except....  Except for the coffee lids!!!!  They crack right at the sipper before I even make it to work (less than 5min) which has caused a number of dry cleaning excursions over the past few weeks.  Other than that...loves it!",1
Coffee Shop 74,"As far as coffee shops go. I have been to a LOT. I am a Realtor by day (and tea geek/superwoman by night), so I am in a lot of different parts of town with time to kill and generally need a place to land for anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours in between appointments.  Imagine my surprise when I pulled up Yelp on my iPhone and saw an interesting coffee shop location right next to a gas station? Yes. A gas station. The coffee shop portion of the gas station is managed by Texenza Coffee. So if you are familiar with them, you know what to expect.  Views; amazing. Tea; fine. Snacks; great. Patio; awesome. Wifi; fast. And they serve wine! This is a place I am going to have to come back to just to relax and enjoy the view.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Good mocha. Bathroom filthy. What good is a classy convenience store with granite counters and whatnot, if all of it is dirty? And I mean everything...toilet seat, sink, counter, floor even had dust bunnies as if it hadn't been mopped in quite some time. Please clean the place so we can enjoy our coffee without being grossed out!",0
Coffee Shop 74,Love the place & service.Excellent view.Nice for a quite evening.,1
Coffee Shop 74,"This place is great! If you need to get gas you can knock out more than just one stop here. You can pick up a latte, a fresh deli sandwich .... even a bottle of wine, yes that is right, they have a full selection of wine you can purchase. I am not just talking about a few select bottles at $4.99, they have a broad selection. It is quite convenient. There is even a great patio you can sit and enjoy your wine! I know it sounds crazy, drinking wine at the gas station but this place is awesome....only in westlake!!!",1
Coffee Shop 74,"I know it's weird, but this gas station has some of the best lattes in Austin.  Positives: 1) Follow them on twitter to get discounts (sometimes you can give them the code word and get 50% off any medium drink). 2) Really nice people working the coffee bar 3) Huge aquarium to check out while you wait for your beverage 4) Beautiful screened in patio out back=romantic views 5) Crazy good lattes at reasonable prices! 6) Beer and wine for that romantic sunset (that's right, the most romantic gas station in Austin!!!)",1
Coffee Shop 74,"I am very disappointed with this place. As a habitual coffee drinker, I sometimes go to this place if I am tired of the boring office coffee. My few visits had been during my lunch hour after pumping gas. I usually go through the drive thru and place my order and get my coffee in less than 5 minutes. Well, the last time I went, I ordered my coffee and drove up to the window. I waited and waited and then waited some more for someone, anyone, to acknowledge me or reassure me my order was being made. The window was open and I could see the guy and I knew he knew I was waiting because he took my order. I guess he was too busy flirting with the girl on the other side of the counter because after 10 minutes of sitting in my car waiting for him to even take my card, I was finally fed up and drove off. It's not cool to keep a paying customer waiting like that.",0
Coffee Shop 74,you'll probably hate it here so don't bother going.,1
Coffee Shop 74,"Coffee and other foods are good enough, what you'd expect.  However, handicap parking makes a person in a chair cross a busy parking lot entrance/exit and cross the drive-through exit, going uphill. I spoke to the manager - he clearly did not care at all.  The handicap parking used to be right by the door, but gaining an easy parking spot for the able is clearly more important.    Coffee's fine, it would be nice if they added a hint of compassion.",0
Coffee Shop 74,"Made a special trip to grab a beer and watch the sunset from the patio everyone (including Austin Monthly) so highly recommends.  After purchasing a cold one, we were told by the clerk that we could not consume the beverage on the premises.  No license.  The clerk, so intelligently, indicated that the cost of my purchase would be triple the price if they sprung for a license.  What a foolish business decision.  They have taken a beautiful location and a great facility and reduced it to just another convenience store.  Don't waste your time.",0
Coffee Shop 74,It's hard to imagine that you're drinking coffee/tea/wine in a gas station.  The selection of drinks and snacks they have are great and the price is very reasonable.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy your purchase outside on their patio deck - views to die for!,1
Coffee Shop 74,"I accidentally stopped in here when I was shooting in St. Stephen's over the summer (June 2010). I was way early and decided to just drive around. I stumbled into Tuscany, and it looked pretty amazing. I was only there for a quick in and out (use the bathroom, get a tea), but was thoroughly impressed. I would definitely go back if I lived anywhere near the 360 area. I was a little surprised to see a cafe inside, and completely did not know there was also a patio. Best convenience store ever.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"first off...we've needed a gas station off 360 between Bee Cave and 183 for a LOOOOOONG time...thank goodness this one finally showed up last year...  second...yowza what a fancy looking gas station...  So, the real reason for reviewing this spot is the lovely cafe/patio area where you can sit and sip a beverage from the Texenza Coffee bar located within.  They have coffee, wine, and beer selections.  There's a nice indoor sitting area, but the real winner is the outdoor covered patio area with a gorgeous view.  Pictures just don't do it justice.  There are plenty of tables & chairs, 2 couches, and 2 flat screen tvs and the decor is simple but dignified.  It's a great spot to stop and smell the roses - seriously the view just makes you happy.  There's also free wifi - so a great spot to stop and surf or do some work.",1
Coffee Shop 74,"Good coffee, nice staff, great views.  Breakfast tacos could be better though.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Cafe Java, you complete me on Sunday mornings. Do I want to cook breakfast? No. do I have all the ingredients? Yes, but, see question 1.    The place is always packed on the weekends. Have I ever eaten inside of Cafe Java? No, absolutely not. Why would I wait in line, wait for a table, wait for an order to go in, then be cooked? Nope. 100 percent nope.  I call ahead. Order whatever I want from bed. Have a cup of coffee and then roll around the corner and walk right in, pick up my bag, pay and boom. Done, breakfast time.  The food is solid simple breakfast classics. The hash browns are browned up nice. The eggs, on point. The bacon crispy AF. French Toast, as you'd except. None of the items are Austin hipster fancy, but dammit they're good.  If you live in the area, order ahead, pick up, and enjoy!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 I was unable to find Corona Coffee, so I had to do a mad search for a coffee/breakfast place before my next appointment. I looked at Yelp and this place was packed with reviews.  Once you go in, it's not hard to see why.  The lady manning the front was knowledgeable, quick, and able to point me the right direction.  Loved their freshly brewed coffee with a shot of espresso - when you can drink it black and be enthralled, you know it's good.  She also raved about their special - which was juicy pulled pork and cornbread, served with a side of hashed browns.  I decided to go for that and a few of their breakfast tacos - chorizo, bacon.   I definitely enjoyed the tacos, they know how to do breakfast. The pulled pork was marinated, tender, juicy, something that just melted in my mouth and formed a great contrast to the cornbread.  Hash brown was lightly crispy on the top and yet a very fresh potato taste.  Great customer service, attractive specials, and go-to breakfast/lunch options will put this on my list of bookmarks to re-try.  #Yelp100challenge Pulled pork cornbread over potatoes Sumatra Breakfast tacos with bacon See all photos from Steve L. for Café Java",1
Coffee Shop 10,"3 check-ins So far, I've had 2 coffees from here and 2 pancakes and it's been superb!  Several of my Yelp friends love this place and I didn't even know it was just down the street from me until Errol M. pointed it out to me.  I stopped by once for a coffee (Iced Latte to be exact) and today I came with a friend and ordered a Mocha Latte and pancakes with chocolate chips and strawberries on it. Both were delicious.  I really want to order something else next time (maybe veggie tacos?) but I'm giving it 5 stars due to the quality of food and very friendly service. It's also so cute and cozy inside.  The long wait gives away how great this place is! A lot better than they look! ;) #delish",1
Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins I can see why this place keeps a line.  You walk in, sign a list and grab a coffee,observer and sit down outside. There's also cold water and cups outside while you wait.  Once called, you are seated quickly. The menu is full of tasty tastes (and they have cakes & pies too)  and I got a delicious omelete that was full of peppers, onions, home fries, crumbled sausage and cheese. Talk about gooooooooood. My friend got the migas and we didn't talk much because that food was going DOWN.  He loved the coffee, the staff was pleasant and the food was bomb so Ill come BACK.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"4 check-ins Wonderful breakfast spot!  I had this place bookmarked for a while, over 600 reviews and 4.5 stars, I knew it had to be good, and it did not disappoint!!  Service was very good, we went for a late breakfast on Wednesday and we were sat immediately, servers came by frequently refilling coffee and water.  I had the special, huevos benedict, it was incredible. A delicious combination of flavors and textures, like eggs benedict but without hollandaise and instead topped with avacado and queso! I mean come on, avacado, queso, and eggs benedict, three of my favorite things, it couldn't be bad!! My boyfriend had a plate with eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast, he enjoyed his breakfast too but liked mine more!  The atmosphere is casual, and the restaurant is cute, it's the perfect diner and a perfect breakfast spot!! See all photos from Marissa P. for Café Java",1
Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins I can't even. This place rocks! The food was really good, service was good, and even the pricing is good!! We tried some breakfast platters. Mine was just eggs, bacon, and a pancake. Wife's was migas and she asked to replace the bacon with their faux meat and it was soooo good! My pancakes were banana flavor. You can't see the bananas at first sight but they were on the underside and boy were they delicious - cooked perfectly .. caramelized! Parking is plentiful but the place is small so be ready to wait on weekends and busy times of the day. (brkfst, lnch, dnnr) I can't wait to try this place again. We didn't even try their coffee!! Goodness~~",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Always love this place. I have introduced my family too it and we are all addicts.  The service is amazing. The food is just really good, you get both quality and quantity for a very fair price.  Be sure to look for the specials on the chalk board.  The coffee drinks are far better than Starbucks and half the price with a better reward system.  Thank you all so much for being part of the Austin vibe - you rock!!!  You may have to wait in line for breakfast on the weekend or lunch rush during the weekdays - but don't let that stop you from trying this place out. The wait does not take long and there is seating outside and they come and find you when your table is ready.   Stay and try it out - I guarantee you will be coming back for more.    Don't forget your coffee reward card! Migas with a side of queso !! Cheap and delicious.. look at that portion size o.O",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I don't typically write reviews but this place is so fantastic, I wanted to share some thoughts. Best breakfast in Austin, hands down. Not pretentious, friendly staff, amazing food. Best hash browns in the universe. Usually super packed so you'll have to wait a bit, but it is definitely worth it. My favorites are the Eggs Benedict, the Egg Sandwich, and the Cafe Java. Hot chocolate is also amazing. Eggs Benedict with side of toast and biscuits.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"The best vibe, the best staff, the best food.  Cafe Java is awesome.  I have eaten the ultimate migas at least 20 times and they have been the best migas i have ever eaten every time!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Great little hidden cafe. The menu is simple but they do a great job. We tried the chorizo and the ultimate migas plates. They were both pretty big portions and come with hash browns, re fried beans and tortillas. I don't usually eat a lot of refried bean but this one I kept going back for because of flavor and even texture. I also had a cafe au lait and it was surprisingly good. Everything was fairly priced and flavorful.",1
Coffee Shop 10,Updated review I am a big breakfast fan - more traditional and less breakfast taco so I have been going to both Kirby Lane and Cafe Java regularly now for the last few years.  Lately it has been more Cafe Java as the Kirby Lane I want to has been inconsistent as of late and the regular employees I got to know being moved to other newer locations.  As others note more than likely you will have to wait as there is usually a line but the breakfast is solid.  Good bacon which is always key and the Cafe Java special is crazy good for value.  Really friendly staff and good coffee from the house to the coffee of the day for a wide variety.  Great way to start a morning.,1
Coffee Shop 10,"Sundays here are packed, not surprising - so I go here whenever I feel like doing breakfast for dinner.  The place has a cosy, home-y feeling and I love that the folks at the register can ring up your food price from memory!  New York boyfriend was also very impressed with the decor and food, and thats saying something. The French Toast, Migas, Huevos Rancheros - I'm yet to order something I'm disappointed by. Also have on good authority that they have the fluffiest pancakes in town!  And the coffees - I wish I could have the Whole Lotta Love latte everyday of my life! Migas!!!! Whole Lotta Love Latte and Caramel Con Panna",1
Coffee Shop 10,"My absolute favorite breakfast place (maybe event restaurant) in Austin. I love this place because it's not fancy in any way, nor does it aim to be. In fact, it's something of the opposite:  very fast paced, kinda loud, a little crowded, etc.  But Cafe Java seems to just ""get it.""  And they consistently get it. Every time.  I liken them to, like, Creedence Clearwater Revival. They aren't necessarily doing anything new, but what they do, they do flawlessly.  Keep doing what you're doing, and I'll keep doing what I'm doing: Lopez 1.  Recommend:  California omelette, rye toast.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins Love love the breakfast here, but it's always packed so I just call in an order to go. Folks at the front are always very friendly, never messed up my order and I always look forward to my food.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I got the breakfast tacos this morning and they are delicious! Nice crispy bacon, hash browns and egg! Always seems to be made fresh when you order. So good and the staff is always friendly. I would recommend this place!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"A happy and cozy place to go with your family and friends for brunch. Their food is solid--nothing crazily amazing, but definitely above average. I believe you can only make reservations on parties of 7 or more, so be prepared to wait (although definitely worth it) if you're coming in on a weekend during brunch hours. I don't live near either locations, but it's worth the drive to have a relaxing brunch with old pals.  Their coffee is so yummy! I don't often drink coffee so I'm not coffee expert, but the ""Whole Lotta Love"" Latte is a restaurant favorite (and mine, as well). I've tried a lot of different items, from pancakes to hash browns to omelets to soft tacos, etc. Everything there will satisfy you for sure, but their hash browns are where it's at. They're amazing and definitely worth the carbs. Don't expect to eat a fancy brunch with exquisite flavors or beautiful food presentation, because that's not what this place is meant for. This is your neighborhood / family-friendly version of ihop, except better in every way. Your waiters will take care of you, and the food and coffee will make your dining experience one that makes you feel at-home. Even for those who don't typically get drinks with their meals, this is a menu worth looking over.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Very busy Saturday spot, but worth every minute of wait, and it's really not that long of a wait. Service was stellar and food was even better. Breakfast sandwich solid, but the Migas plate is some of the best Migas we've had, and the beans were incredible.",1
Coffee Shop 10,Definition of a hidden gem! Great breakfast and such a nicer place than you would expect. Make sure to get queso on EVERYTHING. Will definitely be coming back again.,1
Coffee Shop 10,"Had a really great meal here. Despite being busy we were sat right away and served really fast. I had the Hill country biscuits and gravy. Sooooo good! The interior was great too. Hop but not forced hipster. Our server was great. He was nice, fast, and attentive without being overbearing. Definitely my hubby and I's new go to brunch place.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Everything was very good, but usually very busy. Try a Sunday brunch and you'll be in line for a while.  I'll take nothing away from the food, the service or the coffee. All were excellent. I'm just not a fan of waiting over an hour to sit down for 25 minutes. It is a rather small place after all.  Wouldn't change a thang, except more tables :). Seriously, if you're willing to wait, you can't go wrong.  Breakfast is an event here as the lines will indicate. Very friendly wait staff. You can get your dose of caffeine here as well. Some creative menu items alongside more traditional fare.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"3 check-ins Breakfast for dinner? Sign me up!  I wish this place weren't so friggin' busy during the weekend!  I've been here numerous of times and the quality of food is always good. This place knows breakfast, and I love breakfast. Yum!  Omelettes, pancakes, and French toast are all great here. The Philly omelette was surprisingly good! I have not been adventurous enough to try the cheeseburger omelette even though I really want to (got to watch those calories!)",1
Coffee Shop 10,"This place is so good and all you'd want and expect from a great local diner. No fuu fuu fusion blahh blahh, just great fast quality breakfast (what I came for) served by a friendly team. Absolute pleasure dining here.  I was single, so I was seated a little quicker at the bar. Arriving at 9am it was full and the wait time seemed to be about 20min for groups of 2+. I waited probably 10min for a seat at the bar.  Torn between two specials, I went with the servers suggestion of eggs Benedict with a lemon poppyseed pancake on the side! Perfect. Not too sweet done just right.  Would come back again. Delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins I always seem to forget about this little gem of a place unless I happen to be nearby. I've only been for breakfast and, while there's a pretty significant wait on weekends, it's totally worth it. Service is quick and very friendly, everything I've eaten has always been delicious, try the board specials! Also, as you'd expect from a place with ""java"" in the name, their coffee is damn tasty, too!  I really do need to add this to some sort of regular rotation, not just when I'm around the corner.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I had the Lotta Love Latte with Cherry Chocolate, the cowboy omelette add avocado and my boyfriend got the ultimate migas.

Coffee Shop 10,"5 check-ins Listed in Affordable, but Quality Brunches in Austin On a weekend morning, the line outside is probably going to be a bit long, but it's worth. Cafe Java gives off an Austin vibe, and is probably one of the best places to find a really good breakfast menu.  Their coffee is great, and it's a comfortable place to go for a midday brunch or lunch too. I liked their breakfast tacos and the tuna sandwich is also pretty good.  I prefer this place to Magnolia Cafe or Kerbey Lane and it gives off a much cooler, chill atmosphere. Western omelette Corned Beef Hash",1
Coffee Shop 10,Who let the secret out???  This place is amazing.  Been going for years!!!!   The avocado grilled cheese is wonderful!    And I love the tortilla soup!!!!,1
Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins I was really impressed with Cafe Java. I hadn't been before, but I had heard good things from coworkers so it's been on my list of places to check out for awhile.  My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday morning after 12, so it was already pretty packed. We got on the wait list and it took a little bit, but they appeared to be turning tables pretty quickly so we decided to wait it out. Once we got inside we were seated at a booth with plenty of room and were helped immediately. The staff was super friendly and helpful.  I ordered the egg sandwich with eggs over medium, and it was delicious! I was not disappointed at all. There was plenty of cheese and mayo to go along with the eggs and veggies, so it had a lot of flavor without being overpowering. The hash browns, though...they were amazing. They are super fresh and cooked well.  I had their regular house drip coffee and it was very good! It definitely hit the spot, and they were not shy about refills. My boyfriend and I agreed that it was definitely worth the waiting time in the beginning! We got our food super quick and were able to check out at the front register, so we didn't have to worry about getting our check back while they were busy.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Ah-mazing! Great prices, great variety! Loved it! May need to wait a few minutes for a table as its the place to be, so worth it!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Delicious, high-quality American breakfast foods for cheap!! Latte & coffee are to die for. Also they have daily specials that are oftentimes always worth it. But let me tell you about how I perceived the place, physically. I will go into explicit detail.  I can imagine Cafe Java as the ""alt-rock"" sister of the classic Texas diner; replete with (very cheap) comfort food breakfast choices, families and members of the local community, all congregating for a simple yet legitimately delicious & fulfilling meal.  Stepping inside this restaurant will make you feel as if you were just transported to one those late-90's sitcoms. This cute little piece of heaven is a little eccentric without being pretentious, very homey and full of great people. Everything..I mean everything is perfect in here... from the size of the locale, to the inside temperature, noise level, scents & lighting.  The BEST quality & most valuable asset of this establishment lies in the unbelievably wonderful customer service. There have been more than a handful of times that I solely come to have breakfast here because I'm having a not-very-good day and the servers/staff will immediately cheer me up-- I swear to God this place has the sweetest servers I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Cafe Java is a good distance away from the noisy and over-animated downtown area of Austin, and that makes it a truly special place.  Its location is so concealed that their (very understated) front sign humbly hides behind a tree. I overheard one patron express how this diner doesn't need the extensive marketing & inexcusable overpricing of items other business have to rely on, in order to stay afloat. The number of regulars (who have been living in the neighborhood for years) and ACC students are  enough to keep this place busy and operating.  Finding employees as lovely and attentive is rare in our city nowadays; the people who frequent this cafe are part of a generation of Texan urbanites who still hold Southern values with the stylish edge that made Austin attractive in the first place. Cafe Java feels a microcosm in itself-- like time stopped and you are stepping into a virgin, pre-gentrification, beautiful and authentic Austin. Latte",1
Coffee Shop 10,"My boyfriend was coming to town and he was staying at a hotel near the area and I didn't want to go to far for breakfast so I went on a Yelp search a found this place! I go to the ACC campus near by and I had no idea this restaurant was so close to campus! I will definitely be coming by here more often.    We got there around 9AM and was seated immediately. It was semi crowded. It is a little bit hot inside so I would recommend a tee and a light jacket. The service was fast and quick. With it being so busy, I thought it was going to take a while for our food, but it came out fairly quick! (I'm impressed). I got the California omelet with fruits while he got french toast+bacon+scrambled eggs. I remembered him complementing the bacon, it was cooked just right!    Overall, we had a great experience and I will look forward to coming back! California omelet and french toast+bacon+scrambled eggs!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I visited Cafe Java on a Wednesday around 12-1 pm. The place was a bit crowded, but it was mostly because people were paying near the front entrance. We walked in and just sat wherever we wanted, and then a waitress quickly accommodated us and handed our menus.  I ordered the Soft Beef Tacos without cheese or rice and substituted avocado instead. The tacos were stuffed and filling, but I wouldn't say that they were anything extraordinary. They were decent imo.  The restrooms were pretty weird. I had to go through a door that would lead to a hall with more doors. They were single stalls, and there were two doors. One was for men and one was unisex. It would have been nice to have one for women.  The customer service was good; the waitress was polite and the workers seemed friendly. I'm not itching to return, but if I do, I would want to try one of the more popular items on the menu. Entrance Booths and tables See all photos from Crystal N. for Café Java",1
Coffee Shop 10,"The place is small (in a good way) and it was also packed, we waited about 10 minutes but it was worth it. The coffee is good and the food was great. I will come back again, so if you are looking for a good breakfast you can come here. Not expensive and they offer wifi. Good breakfast:)",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Updated review 7 check-ins Cafe Java part 2!  This time I ordered the Ribeye Platter, which is already a ton of food.  But since it's Cafe Java, I HAD to get a pancake on the side.  This is my post-workout meal; I'm justified, right?  This ribeye steak.  How can this small breakfast place cook a steak better than many steakhouses and bars???  Although their ribeye isn't as thick, it was cooked a perfect medium-rare.  An abundant marbling of fat and the steak grease that we all secretly love.  I'm talking about 70:30 ratio of meat to fat.  Every bite was just amazing.  I seriously may never order anything else.  When it comes to breakfast, Cafe Java is truth.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and their pancakes are still the bomb. Ribeye platter (toast not pictured)",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Waiting times are huge if you go during the weekend or at prime time. However this is understandable, the atmosphere is great and the service is even better. The food is amazing.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I cannot understand all the hype surrendering Cafe Java. I have been here twice now, and both times I was not impressed. On my first visit I ordered the cowboy omelette. Honestly, I make a better omelette at home. On my second visit I ordered two breakfast tacos. I ordered a potato, egg, and cheese taco, and an avocado, egg and cheese taco. My tacos were mostly  just egg. The egg was cooked as if it were an omelette and not truly ""scrambled"". I had to search for pieces of cheese, avocado, and potato.  I would come back here, but it certainly would not be my first choice.",0
Coffee Shop 10,"4 check-ins I have a strange feeling this neighborhood cafe is going to be my hangout while I attend a class at ACC Northridge Campus during the summer. I'm glad they have something like this close by. Not that expensive and the food is good. I ordered a bacon-cheeseburger with potato salad and it was good. The service made me feel like I was one of the people that frequent the spot. That mattered a lot because it made me feel at ease while be in the restaurant that is low lit.  They are in the same mini-mall as the pizza spot, dount shop and a gas station which apparently they also have a cafe too. At least, I know Cafe Java is close by ACC just in case I need a caffeine fix or a meal before class. Sometimes I need a meal and not a bunch of snacks to get me through class. Bacon Cheeseburger with potato salad.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I'm a breakfast lover, so I take my breakfast choices seriously.. hehe. To start, I will say that the Yelp reviews are what influenced my decision and as always fellow yelpers never let me down. The wait for us at 11am on a Saturday morning was 30 minutes, we almost changed our minds just hearing that, but thankfully we stayed. (we were hungry)  Food: VERY delicious and very generous portions, we were full well into the evening. Everything was tasty and delicious!  Service: Although this place was bustling and quite crowded, our service was great all around. Everyone had a smile and kept the refills on water and coffee going up until we left.  This is a must try and I will definitely be coming back when I'm in Austin again.",1

Coffee Shop 10,"I was visiting Austin and wanted to find a neighborhood restaurant for breakfast. I dropped into this place on a Sunday morning and it was PACKED. I mean really packed. Like a 20 name waiting list packed. Fortunately for me i was eating alone and one guy at the bar had just finished his meal so I slipped right in.  I was met with the kindest, friendliest staff I had ever met and was treated to a great breakfast and coffee. I had the corned beef hash and eggs and it was exactly what I expected. All American comfort food right there.  Love this place. Definitely check it out.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Needed a quick brunch near my place in the Domain and it did not disappoint! With cute coffee shop vibes and friendly staff, it made a good first impression. It only got better when the food arrived!  I chose the Migas plate and my boyfriend selected for a traditional sausage plate. The food came out fast and it was delicious! We were so full but had to finish our plates. Also, very affordable and a good amount of food for the price! Where have you been all my life Café Java?! I definitely will be coming back.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Listed in Vegan Austin It's no mystery why this place is a local favorite... As their name implies - they serve up fresh, hot, delicious coffee and coffee-based beverages. This is just a really fun, no frills diner. Small dining room, and LOUD, but good atmosphere. Great food, fun specials, warm and friendly staff, lightning-fast service (despite the fact that it is PACKED on weekends). Vegan friendly. Lots of options. The owner is awesome, and works hard to ensure that customers have an excellent experience. Highly recommend them - stop by for breakfast or brunch and try their holiday migas - YUM. Holiday migas for the win",1
Coffee Shop 10,The 4 stars are not 5 due to the noise level.... we are here on a Sunday morning at 9 am and yes there is already a wait. Love the fact that we were offered to help ourselves to some coffee while we waited the 15 minutes. We both chose the lemon poppy seed pancake special with bacon and eggs. The lemon poppy seed pancakes were very nice lemony. The bacon crisp and the egg just like we ordered them.  Their staff was very friendly and extremely efficient. The wait for the food was not very long either.....we definitely will be back Lemon poppy seed pancake special w 2 egg and 2 bacon,1
Coffee Shop 10,"Awesome coffee. I got an iced Mocha. Not too sweet, not too bold.  The pancakes are amazing, and there is a wide variety of breakfast food that my boyfriend ate very, very fast.    Over all, it had an awesome atmosphere, fair pricing, and the staff was really friendly. Fair warning: at around eleven, they get REALLY busy. Like fifteen people waiting at all times busy.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I had been here before and always had good experiences. But it doesn't get any better than what happened yesterday. My boyfriend wanted to go out for breakfast which sounded like a great idea, but I REALLY didn't have time. I had an appointment and the window was shrinking by the minute. We were both starving though, so we made the 12 minute drive to Cafe Java. Unexpectedly, the parking lot was almost full (10:45 am on a Friday). I started to worry. ""This was a bad idea,"" I said, ""I'm going to be late.""  We walked inside. All tables were full.  I put my pseudonym down on the list (just something I like to have fun with). We were next in line for a table. I was trying not to fidget and trying not to look impatient or think about the minutes ticking by. Miraculously, two tables were soon vacated and we were seated at a nice booth immediately after it was cleared by the efficient hostess.  We ordered coffee and looked at the menu. I'm trying to guess which items might be faster to prepare. The server comes back with the coffee and takes our order.  Breakfast sandwich for him, migas for me, both with hashbrowns and OJ.  I swear I was barely finished stirring cream and sugar into my coffee, when our food arrived. This place is magic.  My partner says, ""I think these are probably the best hashbrowns I've had in my life."" ""I know!"" I reply, ""And I don't even LIKE hashbrowns!"" ""Me either!""  When she came to check on us she also brought the bill without us even having to ask. He went and paid while I chugged the rest of my orange juice. Also, you can get any size refill of your ($1.85) Bottomless Coffee  TO-GO!  I made it to my appointment. This was a topic of conversation all day.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Super delicious food and amazing top notch customer service!  Everyone here makes you feel like family and very welcomed!     This plate was customized for me, substituted the refried beans and hash browns for grilled spinach and mushrooms with a side of avocado slices!   Great balance healthy and goodness! Super delicious!",1
Coffee Shop 10,Came on a Sat morning around 11am.  Small café tucked away in a strip mall.  Went solo and found seating at the bar right away.  Ordered a breakfast taco (sausage) and the corn beef and hash.  Food came out in less than 7 minutes.  Was absolutely delicious.  Excellent service - all the servers were friendly and funny and refilled my water and coffee. Corn beef and hash Breakfast taco,1
Coffee Shop 10,"A nice little place for some great coffee and related concotions. I loved my caramel macchiato. And they also do bottomless regular coffee if you dine-in. Can't beat that! Also, the free wifi is awesome. They are open only till 9 pm though on weeknights, so you can't really get any late-night work done there. They have some great food options too and outdoor seating. Definitely try them out if you're in the area. Caramel macchiato",1
Coffee Shop 10,"5 check-ins After hearing about this place for literally YEARS, I finally went here.  In fact, it turned into a Friday ritual for me over the last few months.  It's such a nice little tucked away place that's also super cozy.  The staff here is always beyond friendly and super personable.  I honestly haven't ventured the menu too much.  My go to is the spinach salad.  After the first time here, I quickly realized why people love it so much.  They have a large, fun menu and the food is always on point.  I don't think they're reinventing the culinary wheel so much but you're getting good food at a great bargain.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"ROTD Some of the best hash browns you can get in Austin.  If you're looking for simple, well-prepared breakfast food - Cafe Java is your spot! I would say the breakfast offerings here are a bit more traditional than Kerbey or Magnolia, but amazing. I feel like this is one of the few places all of my picky friends can agree on! They're so good at over easy eggs, crispy bacon, and biscuits and gravy - my personal faves (other than the aforementioned hash browns).    Be prepared to wait a long time to get in if you come by peak breakfast/lunch hours. But the wait isn't surprising given their great service, great prices, great coffee, and great hash browns. I hope they're able to expand the restaurant soon to deal with the ever growing number of patrons wanting to get in!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"You have to wait for everything, you have to wait to sit down, wait for them to take your order. Then they give you the check and you get to go wait in line to pay. They don't give you a receipt to sign and if you plan to tip you have to tell the lady how much, making it very awkward. The place is extremely cramped and loud. The food is so so. Definitely not worth the trouble or the headache. Oh and good luck getting a to go box for your left over food.",0
Coffee Shop 10,Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place! I had an awesome first time experience at Cafe Java! All the servers were friendly from the moment you come in until you leave. I believe my server's name was Joey and she was very attentive. She gave me a few suggestions off the menu that was very helpful. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and nearly cleaned the plate. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast and will come back another time for lunch. :) Looks better in person I promise! The Huevos rancheros!,1
Coffee Shop 10,"Great ""Mexican"" coffee and I had the ultimate Migas! Came here based I previous Yelp reviews and I freaking loved the experience!  Our waitress Andrea knew the menu and gave great recommendations! Her customer service was AMAZING!!! Go check this place out! Ultimate Migas!!!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"One of my favorite local places for breakfast.  It's always hopping, so be prepared to have a short wait in normal weekday hours and really long wait for weekday lunch and all day on weekends- they do have counter service if you are dining alone or with 1-2 others.  I've only had a few items from the lunch/dinner menu, since I usually order from the breakfast menu, but everything I have ordered has been delicious.  The servers are great and are a big part of what makes this such a popular place.  Good coffee!!  Helpful tips- There is a sign-in sheet located inside near the counter Entrance area is small, so don't let the people waiting outside convince you it's too busy They close at 3pm on the weekend!!

Coffee Shop 10,"A co-worker suggested Cafe Java and so we called in a breakfast order this morning! I had some pancakes and a side of hashbrowns with queso on them (I couldn't resist). One friend ordered some breakfast tacos and my other friend ordered a 2x2x2 and a side of hashbrowns. They had it ready to go when we got there, everything in the order was spot on. The pancakes weren't phenomenal, but they were still good. There was plenty of syrup, but I was missing butter, but it wasn't a big deal. They might have put it on the pancake and it melted, I'm not sure. I absolutely loved their queso and can't wait to try more from this place! The prices were good, the staff was very friendly and quick to get us in an out the door. There were tons of people going in and out so they are definitely popular. All in all a great experience at a great place!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"I had pumpkin pancakes with eggs and bacon.   The bacon was perfect,  I wish I could cook it that way. The employees are all great. There is a long line, but you can get a cup of coffee as you wait. Loved this place.",1
Coffee Shop 10,Amazing pancakes and totally awesome selection!! Hardly ever go into Austin to eat but will make it a point to go to cafe java the next time I'm in the area. staff was super polite to ad very attentive!,1
Coffee Shop 10,"We decided to give this place a try when we visited Austin recently. We loved it so much we ate there every morning we were there. Being from California, we eat breakfast burritos. Here it's breakfast tacos. They are great. We tried a bunch of different breakfast foods - all good. There is a wait, but the tables seem to turn quickly. Service is friendly and efficient.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"We have been looking for a place in Austin that serves breakfast all day and we finally found Cafe Java. The corned beef hash is great, not greasy, no onions (or couldn't taste them), cooked perfectly. Eggs came out exactly as we had ordered them!! Biscuits and gravy very tasty. Had to wait about 20-25 minutes but worth the wait. All the staff were friendly and helped each out so no waiting to get things we asked for and food is served hot & fast.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"The only ""bad"" thing I have to say about this place is that they are always SO PACKED. But that's great for them!  This hidden gem... oh man, what can't I say about them?!  - The service is great. They are so friendly and really attentive! Every single person there treats you like you're their best friend. - The food is not trying to be fancy or modern. It's your typical breakfast joint / diner, but so delicious. I'd rather go here than some of the other breakfast diners :P (Some other reviewers have mentioned these other places). I always try to get something different when I come here, but I always gravitate towards the omelets. They are HUGE! And comes with a (generous) side of hash browns usually. - They have daily specials, which are actually pretty different from the menu items. I've gotten a daily special once or twice because it just sounded REALLY good. And it was! The daily specials are a bit more adventurous.  Highly recommend going here if you have a chance, but expect to wait a while if you're going on Saturday or Sunday morning. Usually about 30-45 minutes on average.  One time, I came here around 8AM on a weekday for a to-go cappuccino, and it was already pretty poppin. So make sure you have some time to spare if you're coming here for some breakfast.",1
Coffee Shop 10,Veggie omelette was perfect and light! Delicious Brazilian cuff was the special of the day. Enjoyed everything.,1
Coffee Shop 10,"I called an order for pick up. I came during lunch time so it was pretty busy. The guy who took care of me was kind of a jerk. Not welcoming at all. I handed him my cards. I realized that my meal was cheaper than I expected, so I went back to my car and went through all the food to make sure it was correct. And of course, it was wrong. I brought it back to them and told them what my correct order was. The kind, older lady took care of me right away. She adjusted the price for me so I can pay the difference I owed since my original order was more expensive. She mentioned to the jerk why she was doing that. Instead of giving a simple ""sorry"" for messing up your order, he went on to say, well the thing said ""Java"" in front of me as if it was my fault. This guy should learn customer service 101 because I've never experience such a rude experience like that before. In the future, learn to say it behind customers back and not in front of them if you don't want another bad review. Food wise, the food was good. I had the ribeye and eggs. The portion was a great compared to the price. My co-workers enjoyed their meal as well. But the experience already left a bad taste in my mouth, so probably won't be coming back. Steak and eggs Togo!",0
Coffee Shop 10,Me and couple friends came to Austin for the weekend and found this place on Yelp...  They were very busy around 11:30 when we talk to In about a 30 minute wait... But well worth the wait.  All our meals were fresh and homemade and hot when they arrive to the table the staff was very friendly a great mom and son Location.... I have definitely saved this to my favorites for when I return..,1
Coffee Shop 10,"It was not gross, was completely edible and a decent amount of food, but all completely void of any soul or depth. People waiting an hour to get in for this?!?  Uhhh WHAT?  Biscuits, pancakes, cream gravy, sausage all tasted like either Cisco frozen goods or a pre-packaged  ""just add water"" item. The two good things were the hashbrowns and the coffee.  I am baffled how this could have so many 5 star reviews.  Sorry to the host who was a charming delight.  I hate to hate like this, but truth is truth. :-(",0
Coffee Shop 10,"Breakfast tacos all day? yesss, please and thank you.  For the life of me I can't find breakfast tacos that use shredded hash browns instead of home fries as the potato component. I only knew of Dan's ... until Cafe Java! Found them while taking an ACC class many years ago and can't let go!  I'm in there (metric or RR) a couple times a week. Patrick is awesome at Metric and Sally rocks @ rr. The tacos are delicious. Egg mixed with shredded browns, one slice of bacon and always EXTRA SALSA! It's delish. I can stop and run an errand between picking up tacos and getting home and they are always hot and fresh. Never takes more than a few minutes to be ready.  Now if people would forget about this place so I could have breakfast here on a Sat or Sun - always packed to the gills.",1
Coffee Shop 10,This place is AWESOME! I ordered the huevos rancheros with a side of corned beef hash and it was the best! The waitress and entire staff was friendly and helpful. I can't wait to come back.,1
Coffee Shop 10,"Updated reviewFood hit the spot, really nice homey feel inside with colorful artwork. Waitress dropped the ball by not mentioning the board with specials, but maybe she thought It wasn't my first time. So check the board or ask, might affect your choice. I went with the country omelet. Descent omelet, but when it said ""potatoes and sausage,"" I was envisioning nice pieces, not the sprinkling of ground pork they used. And for the potatoes I imagined nice chopped, roasted, and seasoned, not the SAME hash browns that come with the plate! I know its still technically a potato, but come on Cafe Java! Its about variety! All in all, satisfying meal, but I know they can do better.  Update: upping my rating. went the 2nd time and waitress pointed out specials. Country Biscuits and gravy plate was very good, quality sausage, lot of food for $8 dollars!  Also, Ive come to appreciate how well the staff works together, which gets your food out fast when they are busy. This is now my go-to neighborhood breakfast spot.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Really enjoyed it here. I thought the Cafe Java breakfast special for $6.79 (ish?) was a good deal and the wait staff was on point. Friendly servers and luckily we were seated without a wait. Didn't try the cinnamon rolls or slices of cake, but they did look good. Beware though, from what I've gathered it gets crowded here on weekends. During the week may be a better option in terms of wait time.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"5 check-ins Hands down one of my favorite places in Austin I absolutely love this place, it's a cool little cafe. This place has a great menu great breakfast lunch and dinner options.

Coffee Shop 10,"Got the Monday blues? Head into Café Java for a ""Whole Lotta Love"" Latte and get yo self instantly cheered up! (Too bad it's Wednesday as I post this... Catch it next week!)  During my visit I had myself a delicious Chicken Caesar salad that came with some of the best toast I've ever eaten. The service was very quick despite them being packed wall to wall during the lunch hour I went. I also recommend buying your coffee beans here as well. You just can't beat fresh locally roasted beans (I myself purchased the Moka Java beans)! I would definitely recommend this place to friends, and I can say that I will for sure be back for some more.",1

Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins Breakfast all day long! Awesome!  If you love breakfast food, be sure to check this place out. Dropped by this little cafe to meet up with some friends and food was way above expectations. There were so many items I wanted to try on their menu that I didn't even know where to start. I ended up getting the Ultimate Migas, which did not disappoint. The other guys ordered the omelettes and the 2x2x2 and they all looked really good.  The food was good, the portion was large, and the price was right. What's not to like? I know I'll be back here soon!

Great food, great ambiance.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"How have I neglected to write a review after eating here for about 4 years now? Delicious breakfast, tasty sandwiches, friendly service, great prices, amazing coffee. It can be a madhouse for breakfast/brunch on the weekends but just grab a coffee at the coffee bar and go outside and wait, it'll be worth it. Eggs benedict on the weekends is my go-to. The burger is even tasty. The oatmeal is great too! You can also do to-go orders. Just go, and go again, get the coffee punch card, and become a regular. Do it.",1
Coffee Shop 10,Certainly an overlooked gem in Austin. The service is AMAZING! And the food is affordable yet so delicious! I would eat here everyday if I could.  Their breakfast is yummy. And those biscuits are toasted like I've never had before. I always order a side of biscuits for the road!  There is usually a long wait but the earlier you go the better. And it's totally worth the wait!,1
Coffee Shop 10,"Their eggs Benedict has queso. Not like, hollandaise. It's like Porfirio Diaz took over Julia Childs kitchen. How dare you?",0
Coffee Shop 10,"Incredible food. I'm not sure how to describe it. I am from San Antonio and I usually order migas at breakfast restaurants. These migas at Cafe Java are how migas are meant to be and what they should aspire to be.  Don't leave until you order a coffee. I got the simple gourmet coffee and it was fabulous. My boyfriend got the ""whole lotta love"" coffee which was amazing as well.  I will be returning maybe every time I visit Austin. Ultimate Migas",1
Coffee Shop 10,"2 check-ins I like this place a lot. They have great, cheap, and fast breakfast. Good coffee too.",1
Coffee Shop 10,Excellent breakfast selections and specials. Good coffee served in a homey and eclectic little cafe tucked  away in this unassuming strip mall off Metric.  The only drawback would be the lines on weekends are borderline ridiculous but that must mean they are doing something right.,1
Coffee Shop 10,"This place is a hidden gem. If you want breakfast any time of the day, this is your place! The Ultimate Migas are the best!!! They have awesome daily specials and the coffee is sooooo good. What I love about this place is the staff. I feel like they are all one big family, feeding me breakfast at home. They are so friendly and I don't actually ever know who my server is because everyone pitches in an helps with every table. I have to admit I have never eaten anything but the breakfast items, but I am sure the rest of the menu is great. Of course there is always a wait when I get there, but that is because the place is small and the food is exceptional. They offer self-serve coffee while you wait.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"7 check-ins Busy! almost always - be prepared  to wait on the weekends.  Free wifi Excellent coffee and espresso beverages coffee for sale, whole bean home made baked goods and desserts  Great service, most the time.  I've only eaten there for lunch and breakfast, but they are open some nights for dinner.  Well known for their migas, refried beans and ranchero sauce.  My fav taco here is potato (hashbrown shreds!), cheese, beans and bacon w/ a side of ranchero.  I want to eat that ranchero sauce on just about everything. the hamburger omelet is just what it sounds like and so good.    Also, they have peanut butter syrup, so I often get a chocolate peanut butter mocha - so freaking good.",1

Coffee Shop 10,Very busy for a Saturday lunch. Wonderful coffee. Yummy breakfast. I'll definitely go back but maybe at a less busy time of the day. Got really crowded at the entrance while waiting for a table.,1
Coffee Shop 10,I went here with a co worker looking for a cafe to do some work. The name is a little misleading in my opinion. The eggs were flying and a waitress called me honey with minutes of my arrival.  All signs pointed to a full on diner situation. I holstered my laptop and ordered some pancakes. Not disappointed at all.,1
Coffee Shop 10,"I'm honestly not a breakfast person with the whole pancake and eggs in the morning. Why not, I'm in Texas visiting.  PACKED! Right when you walk in you have to sign in and wait. I waited around I believe 25 minutes and finally I got to sit down and order.  We ordered:  Country special. Came with two eggs, two sausage patties, 4 biscuits w/ gravy, and hash browns. EVERYTHING WAS BOMB. The biscuits were fluffy and soft woth the creamy gravy. The sausages were chewy and perfectly salty. The best were the crispy brown hash browns.  The ultimate migas was pretty good. It probably could of came with a little more but  what do you expect paying only 8 bucks for a full breakfast!  We also ordered a pancake that was delish and fluffy! This one pancake was pretty big and was shared between two people just fine.  Total only came out to $24! All worth every penny!",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Went here yesterday with my bestie who was in town for the Star Wars opening,  We had breakfast, and both loved it.  I got the Java (2 eggs, bacon, toast, and more hashbrowns than any one person needs, and tea for $6.74) and bestie chose the Ironman omelet (7.99) - he said it's the best looking omelet he's ever seen, and he loved the taste, too.  Great quality food, friendly if somewhat harried staff, and busy even at 10 am on a Friday morning.  We had about a 10 minute wait for a table - not bad at all.  I've been before, and I'm certain to return.",1
Coffee Shop 10,"Our favorite go-to place for breakfast. We love that I get my favorite breakfast foods and my husband, who hates breakfast, can get lunch!

Coffee Shop 55,"Came here with my friend and she announced them having really good latte. She's picky so I trust her. I love how they have artwork displayed along the wall, I enjoy being surrounded by beautiful things. A couple in front of me ordered a gigantic red velvet cake with cream cheese icing, it was a work of art! May want to order from here for my next birthday...  We will be back! Wish there were places where I could charge my phone or laptop so we can stay there all day.",1

Coffee Shop 55,"I feel like a traitor for not loving this Austin institution but I wonder if it's popularity is based more on longevity than products.  I must say I've had Russell's breads at other coffee shops and they're really good.  We came here bc it seemed silly that we have been there yet.  The staff were really nice. The coffee was middle of the road.    I got a banana chocolate chip muffin that I would give a 5.5/6. We also got a blueberry muffin that had a scone like consistency, aka: dry.  The final thing was an oatmeal raisin cookie which I would say was also was alright.  The baked goods in the window looked so tempting but since I didn't love anything else I did not purchase anything else. I don't anticipate a return. Kiddo at the little table, enjoying the oatmeal raisin.",0
Coffee Shop 55,Very cute neighborhood coffee shop/ cafe. The baked goods are on point as well as the drinks! The line isn't usually too long and drinks come out quick. Iv moved into the neighborhood a few years back and iv made this my go to morning coffee place. Super friendly staff also!,1
Coffee Shop 55,Best chocolate croissants I've ever tasted in my life. Cinnamon rolls need more cinnamon for my taste. I'll stick with the chocolate. Almost bought the house across the street so I could get them whenever I wanted.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"Russell's is one of my favorite bakeries in Austin, and has been for years. I love this place, and this review is definitely overdue. Here are some of the reasons that I'm a big fan.  * Russell's provided the food for my baby shower, and I couldn't have been more pleased. The themed cookies, cake and treats (small sandwiches, scones and petit fours) were delicious, and they couldn't have been cuter.  * They have the best croissants - savory (I love the ham and cheese), sweet (chocolate, and OMG - strawberry cream cheese) and of course plain.  * This is a game changer for me ... the Italian sodas. Maybe Italian sodas are not a southern thing, but they are so often left off of the menu at Austin coffee shops. When I was pregnant, Italian sodas were one of my major cravings, and it was hard to seek out a decent one. Some coffee shops don't add cream, some use cheap syrup (which totally ruins the soda) ... Russell's Italian sodas are seriously perfect.  * The people - locally owned and operated, and the staff is very sweet. My friend and I were just in this morning, and the baristas could not have been nicer (it was really busy too!)  * Pumpkin! Like pretty much all suburban girls, I have a special place in my heart for pumpkin flavored anything. Russell's has the best pumpkin bread and pumpkin muffins ... and get this, they have them year round. Elephant cookies. We were so impressed by the adorable (and delicious) cake, cookies and tea party treats that Russell's made for my tea party baby shower.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"The staff there 30 minutes before close were very friendly and helpful when I stopped in on a raining night to pick up some pastries and a hot chai tea. Ambiance, service, pastries and chai were all winners. I look forward to visiting again.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"I realized Wednesday afternoon that I wouldn't have time to make my daughter's (gluten free) birthday cake in time for her party on Friday. I thought I was ordering too late but they said they would try. All we told them was the party was a Fiesta theme and asked for some colorful flowers.  We had the cake in time for when her friends arrived at 4:30 pm Friday and it was better than we could have ever imagined! We are so grateful to Russell's for making her day special. Russell's went above and beyond on the cake we ordered! Top of Fiesta cake Russell's did a great job on this ""Fiesta"" birthday cake for our 12 year old!",1
Coffee Shop 55,Coconut Cake is Awesome! Best I have ever had in Austin. I drew a picture of what I had in mind and Russell gave me a call for clarification. It turned out better than I could of imagined. He combined a coconut cake with chocolate Grenache cake. It was magnificent!! Everyone at the party raved about it & lots of people wanted to take a slice home. Coconut cake layered on chocolate Grenache with chocolate covered strawberries! Amazing!!!,1
Coffee Shop 55,"I pass this place everyday to pick up the kids I nanny for school.  I stopped in one time, I plan on stopping in a lot more but the first time I wasn't sold. The only reason I wasn't sold was because of a girl working behind the counter. She seemed rude and I'm pretty sure she gave me decaf coffee. BUT that's not stopping me from returning. Russell's has all of these amazing looking goodies and treats that you cannot say no to. Props to the baker Bc they do such a great job!  Russell's, I will be back. Partially Bc my last name is Russell and we could be related;) but also because I am determined to try all your amazing looking treats.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Staff was very friendly and the coffee was good an inexpensive. Parking can be a bit tight at times, but still recommend coming here to visit.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"My husband & I stopped here on our anniversary for petit fours. We just moved from California and this is the first bakery we've gone to.  Since I was here specifically for petits fours I asked about the small selection in the display. I was told they were ""chocolate or vanilla, cake and frosting mixed together."" Sounded good enough so I ordered 8 vanilla.  I also got 3 of the decorated cookies for the kids; they're cute, but basic.  The ""petits fours"" are huge!(but everything's bigger in Texas right?)  I was put off to find a bug in the box upon opening it in the parking lot. We ate them anyway & quickly discovered that they are lemon, not vanilla. Not my flavor, but they were nice and moist nonetheless.  I don't regret spending the $40 to support a local business, but I don't believe we will be back. Very moist LEMON cake, not the vanilla we were told... Dead bug Big & pretty",0
Coffee Shop 55,"Ordered a cake from this place and not only are their sweets delicious but their customer service is excellent! I specifically ordered ""no pink"" for the lettering on the cake but they used pink anyway. When I came in to pick up the cake, the manager noticed the mistake right away and apologized and gave me a huge discount for the mess up. It's places like this that make me come back after a big mess up. Thanks Russell's Bakery for being awesome!",1
Coffee Shop 55,5 stars hands down everything here is homemade so good I will be back it kind of hard to park the parking lot is small but other then that the homemade bake goods are the truth all the way down to the cupcakes the best in Austin so far Homemade flower cupcake Homemade strawberry cheesecake great choose Homemade key lime so good,1
Coffee Shop 55,I love everything about this bakery. The people are always so friendly and the food is always consistently really good.  The soups and sandwiches are so tasty and they're sweets are delicious. I've never had a bad thing to eat here. I can't wait for my next visit!,1
Coffee Shop 55,Fabulous baked goods and incredible coffee. Staff is very helpful and friendly! I heard Annie recite a customer's order by heart and I was truly impressed by that customer service! I can't wait to bring my co-workers here for lunch! Come out and support this local business! We met Russell last night and are so glad he told us about his business. What a gem!,1
Coffee Shop 55,"Everyone is really friendly. It's clean and nice. Perfect location. The lemon poppy seed bread is amazing. It's dairy and gluten free. Great for snack, dessert or breakfast.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"I'm allotting two stars instead of one because the apology I received just now seemed heartfelt. This bakery needs a customer service system overhaul to keep customers from falling through the cracks.  I went here in late July on a Sunday morning, waited in a ten minute line, and then put in a special order birthday cake for August. Shop local and all that jazz. I was told I would receive a return call the following day, since the type of cake I wanted, a saccre tort, isn't common. I received no return call nor email. A week went by without any contact. When I finally was able to get someone on the phone this afternoon to confirm that it would be ready tomorrow, I was told that she remembered by order being discussed, but no, that the order had not been accepted. The woman I spoke to, Amber, did apologize and stated that she would have called me to let me know if she had known that no one else had. That's something, I guess.",0
Coffee Shop 55,"They get 5 for their dirty chai lattes, amazing pastries, friendly employees, and good sandwiches.  They make vegan pastries too!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Sandwich, Salads only available until 5 pm.  Walked in at 5:03 and got, "" Umm yea, Sorry...!""  So if you're looking to have a sandwich you will need to come early.",0
Coffee Shop 55,"2 check-ins Not a bad stop for a quick lunch! Their sandwiches are healthy and delicious, and I like that you can sub half for a soup. Get the tomato bisque- its awesome!  When you enter you order at the counter, and you have all those delicious pastries staring back at you. Their cinnamon rolls looked different. I'm no pastry genius but it was all flaky and awesome looking, so I got it, and it blew my mind. Turkey and provolone Grilled chicken sandwich and tomato bisque soup",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Let me stress. People talk about this being a ""coffee shop"", but this is a BAKERY and not a coffee shop.  The coffee is not very good. There were hints when I ordered a cappuccino, and I was asked if I wanted a 12 ounce, 16 ounce, or 20 ounce cup. The coffee comes out of an automated machine much that you might find in a Starbucks.  The bakery stuff may be excellent, but don't go there for the coffee. Heck, go to Epic or Monkey's Nest. Both have excellent coffee and serve Russell's bakery",0
Coffee Shop 55,I met one of the baristas the other day. She said this would be a good place to get some work done on my laptop. Well I'm here and there are NO OUTLETS.,0
Coffee Shop 55,"First time, tried a pastry on the recommendation of a friend. Not two bites in and I overhear the owner /co-owner venting to his acquaintance at the table with him. He's in the middle of this medium sized seating area angrily complaining about everyone from his special needs employees to his coworker family members. The longer I stayed, the angrier the conversation went. After thirty minutes listening to the escalation, I chose to leave. This was on the 27th of January, between 9:00-9:30.",0
Coffee Shop 55,"Great neighborhood spot.  Bkfst croissant's are awesome...baked apple fritter-brilliant.  Truly never had a baked sweet, or one of their sandwiches that I didn't think was great.  Old Austin vibe too.",1
Coffee Shop 55,Awesome bakery place for a quiet n no frill breakfast or bunch. More apt if you are mount bonnell. Loved the garden salad with fat free raspberry dressing.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"2 check-ins Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee I rather enjoyed my visit here today, coming in with a seasoned guest, a friend that recommended we meet here. I chose a honey-cinnamon-almond croissant and a mocha, while she chose a cookie and some tea.  The ordering process was warm and welcoming - a very nice man chatted with us about our day and other pleasantries. We sat down at a nice table in the middle of the bakery. It's quaint with interesting photography for sale, lining the room. My croissant was very good, although slightly dry. My mocha was also very good. My friend has said on several occasions that they have the best cookies.  Parking seemed a little bit limited, although I did find a spot right up front right before the lunch rush. All in all, I can definitely say I'd like to come back to Russell's and try some of their sandwiches, soups and other pastries. Four stars!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"I discovered Russell's pastries when visiting with a friend at a coffee shop called Epoch on Anderson Lane. The Schnecken I sampled was not your ordinary pastry! It was chocked full of nuts and dried fruit, and the pastry itself was very flavorful. Subsequently, I stopped by Russell's to obtain a few pastries for breakfast during the week, and each of those was also quite delicious. I was also happy to discover one can buy Anderson's Coffee at Russell's (a longtime favorite brand), and I have enjoyed seeing work by local artists on display (and for sale).  Responding to Russell's: ""Yes, now that I've found you, I'll definitely be back!""",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Hello, I love this bakery and every time I drive by it I look for it. I really love their sugar cookies. The problem for me I do not make a lot of money and I can never buy them. I know for some people they are at a good price but I am not a rich person. Don't get me wrong I am by no way saying they are doing anything bad, I just personally myself can not afford it sometimes. Like now, I am really craving a couple of cookies but can't get them because I can't buy them. Thanks P.S. everything is good here!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Best place for morning coffee. Yeah it can get busy on sat and sun mornings, but the coffee is good and the food is too! Blueberry scone is my favorite. They have a lot of cakes and stuff, but I've never bought them. They are reasonably priced overall.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Special ordered an 8"" carrot cake for a birthday.  And although the printed decoration was in blue icing, the cake was AWESOME! Highly recommended!!!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Listed in Dessert: Two for me, one for you, Keep Austin Austintatious I am a born and raised Austinite. I've been eating at Russel's since I was 15. Each time I eat there this place leaves me happier than before.  I love everything this bakery/coffee shop has to offer. You can't go wrong from the morning pastries to the cookies to the cake. My all time favorites have to be the cinnamon roles (they make theirs with cinnamon sugar on top, I am not a fan of icing on my roles so I love this option) and the coconut cake. You won't taste a moisture coconut cake in town.  Come in for a coffee, for a dessert, or for a pastry. You won't be disappointed.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Starting with the bakery section: it always looks good, and tastes below mediocre. Bordering on bad. The items that have food coloring have SO much food coloring that you can taste it. The rolls are consistently dense. The croissants are decent enough, but still have room for improvement. Come on. There is nothing worse than someone who thinks they know what they're doing but clearly don't. I've never once had someone ask if I would like a bun or roll warmed. Even Starbucks asks.  The sandwiches are okay. Not great, but not as disappointing as their baking. They don't make them in the evening though, so no, you can't pick one up for dinner.  Drinks are decent. I like their Italian cream soda with blackberry syrup. I haven't had a chance to try their coffee, but you can grind your own to buy by the bag.  Service has always been good and friendly. No wifi during lunch hours because they don't want you to stick around and take up their tables, I assume.  I don't know why this place has so many good reviews. I'm going to assume it's because so many people don't know what made-from-scratch baked goods are supposed to taste like. This place is truly nothing special and their mediocre baking borders on offensive for the price.",0
Coffee Shop 55,"Excellent. The employees are super friendly and their coffee is tasty. They have quite the assortment of cakes, cookies, and pastries. I also got a look at a custom decorated cake another customer was picking up and it was gorgeous. They have soy and almond milk options and also sell coffee beans and nice reusable mugs. I'm glad this place is so close, I might just become a regular. My little butterfly See all photos from Jennie K. for Russell's Bakery",1
Coffee Shop 55,"This is a very nice place for lunch or a sit-down snack. The restaurant has an outdoor patio with lots of seating, as well as nice seating inside. The chicken salad was really good, served on toasted bread and with chips and spicy salsa. Not very expensive at all. Nice service and staff. we were too full for dessert, but the treats looked great. It's perfect for a semi-formal meeting, or brunch/lunch with friends. Very nice!",1
Coffee Shop 55,I've only had coffee and a couple of pastries and it was all delicious. Great atmosphere in a wonderful part of town! Very relaxing to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee. Staff was very friendly and very welcoming. I was there for quite a long time with a friend and felt no pressure to be moved along. It is a great local place that beats a Starbucks any day!,1
Coffee Shop 55,"I haven't been to the bistro location in many years, generally make it a point to come by when I am in town. I went today and had the usual flourless chocolate endeavor ( thats what I call it) it's great as I remember, but I walked in and the glass display case was gone. I was quite saddened that I couldn't see the offerings because I am a visual buyer. The muffins and croissant were captive in a lucite display case that in my opinion made them look cheap. I felt a little cheap myself and that is not the feeling I recall  having since you opened some 6 years ago. The experience is why I have rated you so low. I hope you understand.",0
Coffee Shop 55,"Love love this place! Any time I'm looking to catch up with someone I suggest Russell's. Its calm, quiet and the windows and spaced seating are great. The service is always so friendly! Sorry I do not know your name but to the lady who has straight across bangs, works the register and has been there for a while, you are so sweet, helpful and always make eating here pleasant! Not to mention the food is delicious! Coffee good, sandwiches incredibly filling, cupcakes and cookies are perfect, oh man and their cinnamon buns?!? Y'all are so great! Will be back again and again.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Listed in Our favorite every day restaurants We go to Russell's for coffee and cinnamon rolls on Saturday mornings. Their coffee is good but the cinnamon rolls are what we really come for. Not your typical cinnamon roll... more like a cinnamon sugar croissant-type pastry, but they are delicious. The Hancock location has very little atmosphere to it (minus 1 star), the one on Kerbey Lane is much better.  Tips: Ask for your cinnamon roll to be warmed up, get your coffee in a to-go cup",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Been twice. First time was nice. 2nd was very disappointing.  I was sold a decorative holiday themed cupcake (for a child). It looked great but it was really stale. The cupcake was discounted (while it was being rung up I found out it was 1/2 price). But I thought this was because it was just after the holidays, not because it was more or less inedible. Coffee was nice. But please don't sell rock hard cupcakes to little kids. Not cool. If the inventory is inedible just throw it out and don't sell it to people. If I want the funky Austin bakery experience I will probably go to Quacks.",0
Coffee Shop 55,Updated review 4 check-ins Listed in Coffee Thursday Holy WOW! Just had a pumpkin muffin from Stinson's that was made in the wee hours of the morning at Russell's. It's 8pm and the muffin b is still crazy moist and fresh! They seriously have the best pumpkin muffins... like damn.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"We have been to Russell's Bistro once and it was fabulous!  We thought we would give Russell's Bakery a chance today for lunch (6-25-15).  What a a let down.  The sandwiches we chose were ""ok"" at best.  Seriously, $9 for a couple of pieces of lunch meat on and one slice of cheddar cheese?  The tortilla soup was lukewarm.    The worst part about our lunch was the person taking our order.  She was so preoccupied with what the other employees were doing and answering their questions that I had to say my order at least three times.  She seemed a little put off that we only wanted lunch and didn't order any pastries or coffee.    Won't be back :(",0
Coffee Shop 55,Quite possibly the worst cupcake I have ever tasted. The cake was extremely dense and tasteless. Icing practically frozen solid ( hard to bite through) . I was shocked that someone could actually create a cupcake so bad.,0
Coffee Shop 55,"Such an incredible place to go, you can read your emails while your lil one plays with magnets and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee as well as a nice cake or one of their wonderful cookies ... Lunch is great... I was running late and stop for a quick fix and end up surprised by their delicious chicken salad sandwich.",1
Coffee Shop 55,Russell's Bakery took in a last minute order for my sister's 21st birthday cake. They did a fantastic job and for such short notice more than exceeded my expectations. Everyone loved the cake and my sister was so surprised!,1
Coffee Shop 55,2 check-ins We came in on a Saturday afternoon about 15 minutes before they closed. I was worried the staff would be annoyed but they were friendly and took care of us. I got the key lime tart and my fiance got the strawberry vanilla cake.  My tart was perfect. No fake bright green key lime in this joint. It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart with fresh whipped cream! I love fresh whipped cream.  Fiance's cake was a little dense but good.  I'm looking forward to trying out their lunch offerings one day!,1
Coffee Shop 55,"I love this place!! The food is amazing.. So far I've tried their tomato bisque soup, ham & cheese sand, turkey club, the breakfast croissant & of course you have to try their pastries...  Def worth it Turkey club on wheat... Yum",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Russell's is on my way to work, but today was the first day I stopped in.  My quad latte was delicious and prepared perfectly, but I have to take away one star for the weird geriatric vibe of the place.  I've never seen so many senior citizens in a real coffee shop (like...not a dunkin donuts or a crummy diner).  Maybe it's the area?  Also, they apparently have a no-wifi no-laptops during lunch policy.  Weird, but just FYI.",1
Coffee Shop 55,Wow! Super short notice for a birthday cake and this place did not let down. The cake looked amazing and the staff was super friendly. Thanks guys!!! Glad I found this place. Bubble guppy cake,1
Coffee Shop 55,"Great sandwich!  Lot's of meat, good bread and fresh veggies.  Cool little place to have coffee, sandwiches and desserts in old Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"We took some out of towner friends to Russell's yesterday for a late lunch. This place is calm and quiet and cold--it would be a great place to post up with a laptop as well as enjoy a meal with friends. We opted to sit indoors given the heat.  I tried the chicken salad sandwich--a ""favorite."" It was a favorite of mine for sure. I also had a cup of their chicken tortilla soup on the side. It wasn't spicy at all and had big chunks of avocado and tortilla strips floating in a tomato broth. My chicken salad was pretty delish as well with little chunks of celery for texture. A friend got one of their warm croissants and was raving about how great it was. This same fried almost bought out their dessert cabinet before we left. I am still eating leftover cheesecake at this very moment, savoring the sweet side of Russell's that I had yet to try. I will be back with my sweet tooth in tow next time.  The parking situation can be a little hairy...good luck!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Tuna Fish Sandwiches, oh yea! Tuna Fish Sandwiches, so good! Russell's was the only eatery close to my claustrophobic apartment, and it became sacred to me. I use to get up and my boyfriend would go out for coffee, and I'd talk to him and listen on the high octane fuel of their house coffee. After the half year mark, a Batista put a leaf or a heart of foam in my mocha's. Those were my happiest days in Austin. If I went for lunch this meant that my boyfriend cared about me that day, and I always got Tuna Fish Sandwiches. I enjoyed their art up for sale too. In my one year of living in Austin, Texas, half my photographs are taken at Russell's. It's a wonderful place to take loved ones and enjoy a moment in the busy city. The staff are truly beautiful souls. I miss them a lot. And their coffee. They made me love Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Really friendly and efficient staff. Good coffee...The selection of baked goods alone is more than enough to make me a regular. There is a lovely variety indeed, and most of them are amazing. The palmiers were a bit waxy for my taste, but the cheddar and black pepper scones blew my socks off!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Great little find! The atmosphere is quaint and the coffee is good. Baked goods are priced well, and they came through for me on a last minute special occasion cake. The only improvement I would like to see would be a little more moistness in baked goods. That would give this 5 stars!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"4 check-ins Harvest bread is a favorite in our house. Cinnamon rolls and filled croissants delightful too. Office is always happy when I bring morning treats from Russells. They make a mean birthday cake (Italian cream is my favorite, but many to choose from), and delightful seasonal decorated cookies, too. A favorite place to meet for coffee. Rotating art gallery to enjoy. Comfortable, friendly neighborhood hangout that welcomes all people. Someone in my house is there weekly, on average. Never gets old.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Really nice staff, yummy pastries and a great stop for a coffee break. Lovely location. My fave pastries were the bacon cheddar scones and the lemon poppyseed muffins. :)",1

Coffee Shop 55,"Way too expensive for a sandwich not as good as Jason's Deli. Meat was just ok, veggies wilted, and Iced tea is $3.00 spent $41.00 for 3 sandwiches and 3 drinks.

Coffee Shop 55,Love this place!! They are always wonderful but this year they saved me at Thanksgiving! I had ordered two pies and then forgot to pick them up on Wednesday. One of the employees stayed late the night before Thanksgiving so I could come get them. So awesome!!,1

Now go get that bun!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Russell's Bakery is a nice little cafe tucked away on west Hancock. They have a delicious selection of baked goods, cakes, pastries, etc. Prices for baked goods are about right. The coffee is better than average but nothing to write home about (but refills are free).  I got the half sandwich and soup combo and it was very good but the only reason they didn't 5 stars is because their prices are a tad bit high.  Staff is very friendly, helpful, outgoing and hardworking.  I will return - their German Chocolate cake very good.....;-)",1
Coffee Shop 55,"2 check-ins I always rely on Russell's for special event cakes and they have never failed me. My wife expects the finest when it comes to celebrating her day. So I've purchased her last 5 birthday cakes from Russell's since I found out about them.  Recently my parent's celebrated their 50th wedding anniversay and we called on Russell's to wow us yet again. They succeeded by leaps and bounds. When I presented the cake at the party, the crowd let out a loud ""OOOOOOHHHHH."" Then they took pictures of the cake before we sliced it up.  Alway fresh, rich and made to order. Thank you Russell's Bakery.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"This place looks cozy, and comfy from a drivers view and I do pass by it Monday thru Friday. Heck, especially on a cold, gray day. But I have been inside once and I guess they really love regulars over newcomers. Or maybe something else. Apparently the kitchen was closed and the pastries out for view were all that was left to buy. After rude service and looks, we left and do not plan on coming back.",0
Coffee Shop 55,"Lovely spot for an afternoon coffee. Very professional service.fantastic coffee and food. My favorite is the tomato soup. Yummy comfort food! Easy location to get parking, sometimes you might have to walk a bit but area is lovely so not a problem.",1
Coffee Shop 55,This was a relaxing spot for a light weekend lunch or midday snack.  I had the sandwich combo which included a half sandwich (I had the turkey club) and a salad.  It was a reasonable portion and well prepared.  My husband had cake and a latte.  Both of which he thought were delicious!   Service was excellent and very helpful.  It is counter service but they bring the food to you and this done very promptly.   I would definitely go back.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"I found this place because someone brought key lime pie cupcakes (or mini tart-lets, I'm not sure which) to a dinner party and they were amazing! I was ordering a cake for my boss's birthday last minute and they were able to have our order ready in time. They were extremely nice, and the cakes were amazing! This is definitely my go to from here on out!",1
Coffee Shop 55,If you want some good pastry and a good cup of coffee this is your place.  Quite family oriented atmosphere.  Worth the trip to north austin.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"I love, love, love Russell's. These folks are wonderful people and their pastries are incredible. They truly epitomize everything that is great about local businesses run by people who care about their customers. Going there just makes you feel good.  And they know what they're doing. I cannot recommend them highly enough - for anything from a pastry and cup of coffee to an elaborate custom cake or catering order, you will not find anyone better.  PS - Amen to everyone who has mentioned the amazingness of their cinnamon roles! I relocated from Austin to LA, and I can testify that the relocated Austinites around here miss them like they miss Barton Springs!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"What a sweet place (and I don't mean the baked goods.)  Some girlfriends and I celebrated a birthday here and it was lovely.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm not a big fan of ordering at a counter.  But they are so nice here, they don't rush you and answer questions with a smile.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The Greek salad was HUGE.  The massive ham and cheese croissant needed it's own zip code.    We didn't order dessert, but was given samples of the black forest cupcake and we all made yummy noises and didn't care who heard us.",1
Coffee Shop 55,Russell's is a quaint special local coffee shop with excellent pastries and cakes. Chicken salad on a croissant makes a nice lunch and I frequent here for meetings. After bringing newbies here for coffee meetings they always convert to Russell's fans. Lemon bars = awesome.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"Best cinnamon rolls in town. They're not the kind covered with frosting. Just cinnamon and sugar (and probably lots of butter) rolled up in great dough. They're huge. Also serve Anderson Coffee, our favorite coffee and locally roasted in Austin. I've had sandwiches and salads here, which were good, but I mainly go for the cinnamon rolls.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Hands down the BEST tomato bisque soup I have ever had! I live in LA but I've been coming to Austin a couple of times a year for the last 13 years or so. My sister used to live down the street from Russell's 12 years ago. That's when I discovered it! I try to stop by when I visit. Did I mention I LOVE their soup?? We have gotten cakes from them several times and they've always been excellent! Another tip is always choose the butter cream frosting! It's amazing! The cream cheese frosting isn't very good. It tastes a bit fake and the texture is off. But the chocolate cake with chocolate butter cream couldn't be better. Did I mention my family owns a bakery in Los Angeles? Trust me, I know what good cake should taste like!",1
Coffee Shop 55,Best coconut cake in Austin and the chocolate espresso cake was fabulous.  Both cakes were a huge hit.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  I won't go anywhere else for cakes.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"Listed in North Austin Russell's Bakery is a nice little cafe tucked away on west Hancock. They have a delicious selection of baked goods, cakes, pastries, etc. The cakes look amazing, I have had my eye on the carrot cake for some time. Their cinnamon rolls and schnicken (sp?) are flaky and delicious. Prices for baked goods are about right. They make a good espresso or cappuccino; the coffee is better than average but nothing to write home about (but refills are free). What stands out for me is the great service, the workers are friendly, helpful, and keep the place clean. The service is what keeps me coming back.  The sad truth is that there are not many other options in the area unless you are willing to hold your nose and check out one of the 2-3 Starbucks in the area.  Recommended, 4 stars for the pastries!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Disclaimer: I'm reviewing Russell's as a coffee house more than a bakery.  I've heard fine things about the many pastry options at Russell's, but as a coffee house, it's sub-par. There's nothing special about the coffee selection or its presentation. Neither is there anything special about the atmosphere at Russell's. I should have taken a cue from the fire-sale type paintings on the wall that look like someone's grandma painted them in a community college night class and known that I wouldn't really like this joint.  I drank my coffee, ate my cinnamon roll, wishing they had at least offered to warm it up, and took off. I had no desire to hang out or have another cup. It's all business at Russell's. It's all bland...much like this review.",0
Coffee Shop 55,Geat pastries. Great Coffee.,1
Coffee Shop 55,"ROTD Listed in Review of the Day? More like review of the CENTURY. This is a delightful spot for brunch on a weekend. Maybe my opinion is inflated by one too many so-so experiences at Kerbey Lane, which neighbors Russell's, but I'm amazed we didn't stop in here sooner, and I'm fairly certain we'll be back here before we bother with ol' KL again.  Our breakfasts were note-perfect, starting with the eggs and going on down to the mimosa for me and his coffee. The menu sounds tasty from top to bottom; dinners seem to be a bit on the pricey side.  Friendly service and cute-for-a-coffee-shop atmosphere. They might not hit the perfect note every time, but for us on the muggy, relaxed day we stopped in, it was juuust right.  OK, one complaint: wobbly tables. Why is it that so many places have this issue?",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Things I would do for one of their Chocolate Indulgence:  -Spit on an old woman -Scare a baby and make it cry -Trip a blind man  OK, maybe I wouldn't do any of those things, but under the right circumstances I would consider it. Yes, the Chocolate Indulgence is that good. It is like this Chocolate Mousse thing they don't always have on hand, but when they do...get it.  The bakery itself is quaint. It isn't open very late so I can't really make it a regular hang-out. But if you want to pick up dessert for dinner it is a great place to go.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Great coffee and chai. It's clean and the people are nice. The baked goods are wonderful. It does seem like I've seen thier pumpkin bread and other items at other coffee places. Almost one entire wall is glass and I love the light. As one reviewer put it it's not a ""cool"" place and I find that relaxing. I think the sandwiches are a bit pricey but it's a quiet place to sit or have a chat.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Great soups, sandwiches (chicken salad, especially), (completely amazing) cinnamon rolls, pumpkin muffins, cakes and atmosphere.   It's a great breakfast & lunch place!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"The best Saturday morning routine in the world. I love their iced coffee and spinach and mozzarella croissants.  We bring our dogs and enjoy the cool summer mornings.  Such friendly people, such delicious food!",1
Coffee Shop 55,"I went for elevensies yesterday with a dear friend and oh my god, just feed me cheddar scones for the rest of my life.    But seriously, the place is gorgeous, the baristas very nice and the ambiance on the patio is great.  I want to be a lady who lunches just so I can wear kicky pantsuits and spread my portfolio out here, if you know what i mean.    In the meantime, a scone and an awesome gingerbread latte will have to do.  Bonus points for big hand-cupping mugs.",1
Coffee Shop 55,"My husband and I stop by at this cafe on weekends for some great coffee & baked goods. He especially loves their cake slices. So for his birthday I decided to order their red velvet cake & it was delicious. I also sent an email just 2 days before asking them to do a custom fondant on it. I got a call within an hour confirming that they would do it & checked with me on any other specifications. The cake was ready on time & it looked exactly as I wanted it, and tasted even better. :)",1
Coffee Shop 55,"Love this place. In my neighborhood, great coffee they serve in a china cup, and pastries that make me swoon. A find.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Spouse and I decided to have an impromptu activity date night on Tuesday. He's been trying to get me to go here for months to try out. I should have listened to him!  When we walked in my first thoughts were ""Wow, those are nice espresso machines!"" The rows of games in front clued me in to what they really cater to - REAL board games. Some games are very involved and can last for days, others fairly simple and can wrap up in 15 minutes.  The menu is mostly sandwiches but they are excellent - get the panini pressed! Mocha is To.Die.For and their selection of beers is fabulous. The have a delicious cider on tap that I will go back for and they also have sake(!) that can be served hot or cold.  Staff are more than happy to help find a game that fits your preferences. We decided to play a tiles game that was a lot of fun!  The space *is* a bit tight but the owners have obviously tried to squeeze as much as they could into a smaller space as legally (and safely) possible. Think of it as a grandma's well-lit basement - good food, beer on tap, and a bit claustrophobic with all the memories squished into a tight buy happy space.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"7 check-ins Board games are NOT just for children. In fact, I didn't even know there were so many others kinds of games besides your standard Monopoly and checkers!  Emerald Tavern is a great board game shop and cafe that lets you test out games from their Game Library before you buy it. Yes, you can play board games here!! Their Game Library is huge and well-stocked with the newest games! They all have stickers that will tell you how long each games takes to play, too.  Yes, it's free to play their games, but you should really at least 1) purchase something from the cafe (they do have alcohol), and 2) leave a review for this small business so they can get even more business, or even 3) consider purchasing your board game here instead of Amazon.  There is definitely limited seating for the board games, so be sure to come early to snag a table for you and your friends! They also have some events like Painting with a Pint. Be sure to check our their website for the full calendar.  Emerald Tavern is a great place to discover new games and to interact with your friends!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"We love this store.  Great selection of games.  Great selection of drinks; both alcoholic and not.  Great selection of food (though a nice Italian sandwich would be a great addition).  Not sure about buying a game?  Grab it from the back wall and play it for free first.  Great, knowledgeable staff.  Great events, such as painting with a pint.  A must stop for anyone looking for a game, a drink, or just a cool place to hang out.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Listed in 2016 150 new Yelp reviews Came here for coffee after our Slab BBQ debacle...yum.  Got a very well made café latte and took lots of pics, not many places in town to play board games, drink coffee/beer/wine, and if you really enjoy the game, they also sell them.  Saw lots of Star Wars memorabilia and baked goods from Lil Mamma's, which I think are better than Russell's. See all photos from Tim C. for Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Very helpful, friendly staff.  Great mocha! Huge variety of games to buy.  Back wall has a library of different games that you can check out and play with friends for free at any one of the many tables available.  Fun place to spend an evening playing board games and drinking a great beverage and eating a sweet (they offer a nice little variety of different pastries/sweets). They need one of these in the town I live in!!  Perhaps the only thing that keeps me from giving it a a 5 would be the cost of the games on the shelf for purchase; none seemed to be on sale but perhaps I am just not up to date on what board games cost these days.  Not noisy, so you can hear each other well and has good lighting to see the cards/board game. Would definitely come back.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I'm so happy my friend took me to this place! There's no time limit here, so we easily spent 3 hours here trying out various board games. If you like the game you tried, you can easily purchase it here! The prices for their games were on-par with Amazon (maybe $1-2 more) so it's not terrible and you support a local business!  To borrow their games, you have to purchase a food/drink. I got a glass of mead and one chocolate chip cookie. Their cookie was soft, chewy, and filled with chocolate goodness. It definitely tasted fresh, and I would get it again!  The only downside is that the place is a bit small which makes it hard to find a table at times.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Went here today with some family and friends. The food was incredibly well priced, and pretty tasty. The coffee drinks were a higher standard than expected. The bathrooms were super clean and stocked. Most of the staff was incredibly helpful and inviting. We kept getting drinks and ate lunch throughout the 6 hours we were there, my boyfriend and i spent about $40 for all the drinks and food, and had a great time. Board games were categorized and even had an expected time limit on them. Really recommend this place, especially when looking for something for everyone.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"A group of my team mates from work and I went here a few weeks ago because we didn't have a place to play board games. We all live in pretty small apartments and had never been here before so we wanted to check it out.  I like to be freezing cold in the summer time and I was thrilled that it was so cold in there. I mean the temperature was absolutely perfect. Their library of games was huge and the atmosphere was very friendly. The staff seem passionate about what they do and that's a huge plus to keep me coming back to any business. A happy employee gives any establishment the positive energy it needs.  The reason I'm giving 4/5 stars though is because we went on a Thursday and this place was packed! There was barely enough room between us and the tables on either side of us. With Austin growing, I think a lot of the smaller businesses in the area may need to go bigger. Also, I work night shift and don't get off of work until 12:30 am. I can't enjoy our new beloved Emerald Tavern because of this. :( Not their fault on the timing but the space in there made a couple of my co-workers have to keep going outside because they're claustrophobic. I shall return though!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I've been coming here once per week to play board games for the two years. It's a great place to meet other people to play board games with, has a decent food and drink selection, and a very welcoming atmosphere. It can get crowded on the weekends after 1:00, so if you're coming here for the first time I highly recommend coming before noon if you want to get a table.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Fantastic place to play games. Great Coffee, booze, food, food. Friendly staff.  Came here many a time.  Only downside- the games for the mainstream crowd are a little lacking- give me some chess, checkers, monopoly ( or maybe those were always occupied when I was there?)  Worth a visit for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I had a blast at Emerald Tavern last night. It was my first time there and I would definitely come back next time I am in Austin. The place offers everything a board game geek (like me) needs for an awesome night - food (check), beer (double check) and a huge library of games (triple check). Erich, Emerald Tavern owner, had graciously taught me ""Sails of Glory"" and the conversation was lovely. Thanks for a great night guys and keep up the excellent work",1
Coffee Shop 19,"When I think of ""board games,"" I think of chess or checkers and not D&G... So take or leave this review as you wish.  I suggested this place for a date because I thought it would be an awesome way to break the ice over some light board games. Little did I know that this is not just your casual Wednesday Family Night board games... This is nerd level 11 out of 10 board games.  After not finding neither checkers nor chess, we actually ended up having a ton of fun over Scrabble (me more so than the date since I won... Mwahahaha #competitive).  Note: the beers come in cute tiny goblets, not full-sized mugs/glasses that inhabitants of the Middle Earth are accustomed to...",1
Coffee Shop 19,"4 check-ins Looking for a rowdy night on the town filled with mead, deception, good company while still keeping it fairly low key? Meet me at Emerald Tavern!  I've popped in here a few times. The first time just for a coffee with a friend but the second time I popped in with a group of 8 for all kinds of trouble. We got there early and snagged 2 tables side by side. If you have a large group and require two tables, bear in mind that they require you fill out the tables. If we had had 7 people, we would have had to give up one of the tables and crowd around one smaller one. So come in groups of 4, 6, or 8 unless you like to crowd around a smaller table.  Large selection of games for purchase or to play for free. A whole wall of in house games! Most people are fairly quiet as they play but there are the occasional tables that are playing a game that involves a bit more enthusiasm (Cards Against Humanity, for example). Overall, it's a great environment for however player you are.  I haven't tried any food, but I have tried drinks! Their Chai Latte isn't too bad. Haven't tried the espresso yet because Miss Kaylee behind the counter tempted me with a special wine smoothie and then one of their menu items: the Beesting. Half cidar, half mead. SO GOOD. SOOOOOGOOOOODDDD.  Come early and nab a table. They go fast and most tables don't leave quickly.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"First time here, and we were overwhelmed with a world of games we knew nothing about. But Craig walked us through all the types of games and even walked us through playing our first game. He patiently helped us and answered all our questions and kept checking on us. If it weren't for him we probably would have left flustered but now we will be back.... Regularly... With friends.  Everyone else that worked there was polite and cool and the menu is on point!! We loved our coffees, fresh warm cookie and grilled cheese!  We left buying a new game and headed home to play!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"2 check-ins A place for young and old game lovers! A variety of games can be found on the back wall to use for free. I would highly recommend grabbing one of their drinks at the front of the store while you're battling your friends away. They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks which are comparable to Starbucks prices. I think one of the best things about this place is the temperature. The temperature is never to hot or too cold in this place! Temperature may be one of the last things one would consider when playing a game, but hey, it sure does help when you're battling for wheat as one of the settlers of Catan.  Drinks: I would recommend getting the organic English breakfast tea with soy! Settlers of Catan! My second time at this gem of a place and I'm still loving the atmosphere! English breakfast tea with soy milk. My stomach loved this.",1
Coffee Shop 19,Surprised and loved it. Great service snd food. A gem in a great location and a wonderful beer selection.,1
Coffee Shop 19,"I love the concept of this place---tables to play games, coffee, beer and food options and demo games available to try out. I wish they had more tables and better acoustics...it was hard to concentrate on my next move while hearing the conversations of the tables next to me. I also had an absolutely HORRIBLE s'mores brownie. I took one bite and threw it away. It didn't even taste like chocolate! But I will certainly be back to play another game!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"As an avid tabletop gamer, I wanted to take the time to check out the various game shops in Austin this trip home. I have to say that Emerald City might be my favorite. They don't have the largest selection, but I felt they had the best curated. I saw great games in every category, which is impressive for a shop of this size. The fact they have coffee and beer is a nice bonus!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"4 check-ins ROTD I am very new to this concept of being able to drink alcohol, eat yummy food, and play a variety of awesome board games - but I love it!  In exchange for buying something at the cafe or a game from the store, you can play whatever game is available on the shelf  in the back (or if you bring your own) and you can put a flag at your table if you desire for others to join you.  It's a great way to possibly meet new people or kick it with a group of friends.  We came here to try out Carcassonne and decide if it was worth buying.  We had a wonderful time sipping on cider and beer and figuring out how to play the game with our friends.  The staff is really friendly and helpful.  They also make some delicious paninis! They have a good selection of drinks, coffee, and desserts.  The atmosphere was very lively and I love the music playing in the background - lots of HP soundtrack songs and other mystical tunes that helps transport you to whatever magical game world you are currently experiencing.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys playing games.  You won't be disappointed!! Intense gaming.",1
Coffee Shop 19,This is probably my new hang out place. Awesome game selection. The game prices are pretty much the same I've seen anywhere else. They have a nice selection of drinks and you can play games while you relax. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere over all. If you are someone that loves boards games and coffee or beer this is a place to frequent. I can't believe I've been in this shopping center so many times and never noticed this gem.,1
Coffee Shop 19,"My husband and I are regulars here. Aside from my weekly board game meet up every Tuesday, my husband and I go every other week or so to try new games. The staff (Craig and Jasmine especially!) are very nice and extremely helpful.  The food is alright. Nothing too crazy but I do quite like their in house baked chocolate chip cookies. Their coffee is also always on point. Never had a bad latte there.",1
Coffee Shop 19,Jasmine is super nice and awesome .  I love this place ! The hummingbird water is good . Nice games . I recommend this place to everyone !,1
Coffee Shop 19,"This is the most difficult review I've ever had to write; why? Because I love this place. On a normal night it would receive 4 or 5 stars. So how can I justify a two star rating?      Well,  I've been a regular here for over a year.  Every Tuesday,  I and 4 to 12 friends come here,  eat, drink,  but games,  and revel in good company with a welcoming atmosphere.  I have spent  several hundred dollars here,  and my group has easily spent thousands. In addition to this,  I know every member of the staff by name.   They are wonderful,  and I recommend high tips when you do come.  The staff usually makes up for a somewhat simple menu.            The problem is with the management.  Apparently, it is okay to let a group reserve EVERY table in the joint. I arrived at 4:30 pm to no other guests,  but ever table was reserved with the exception of one 4 top.  At this point I should mention that emerald tavern has four groups of regulars that show up every Tuesday.  EVERY Tuesday.  So I thought I would ask the person who reserved all of the tables if we could have one of the six tops. It might be cramped, but we're flexible,  and would happily pull up chairs.  He said, ""no."" How easy would it have been for him to give up two seats out of more than forty so that my group could enjoy the night?          The important message to take away us that management will screw  the garunteed money of it's regulars, for the potential money of new blood.         I was going to buy 2 games tonight,  too...",0
Coffee Shop 19,"Order, sip beer, eat, and stand around with a handful of dishes like an awkward creeper as you wait for the impossibility of table to open up. This place on paper is the absolute greatest thing on earth! A cafe/beer garden that's also table top gamer hang out!... AND a freaking game store!? What's not to adore about this concept? Well the problem lies with the execution. The tavern is the size of a small restaurant with half the space being utilized for board game shelves arranged in isles... In a perfect world It can seat 25-29 people at the most with every table fully seated. Usually you will have a table for 4 occupied by a party of 2 so the average number is closer to 12-18 people seated comfortably. Now couple that with a great original concept in a city full of people looking for something different to do with their night. The result; standing around like a confused elderly person waiting for a space to open up in a hang out designed for loitering for long periods of time.  Pro-tip: check to make sure a table is available before you order. The order counter is at the front  and the majority of the tables are hidden behind the game shelves, so it's an easy trap to fall into where you order first before you find a seat. It's a mistake I will never make again. I had to stand there and hold plates like a jackass in the isles until I got tired of waiting for a table to open up. I had to send my food and coffee back because I couldn't eat it. This place would be an epic hangout... But it's way too small to handle being both a game store and restaurant. If it's peak time prepare to wait. Oh and one more thing of note... On any given night tables are reserved for various game groups thus slimming your chances of finding a seat even further. Sigh.",0
Coffee Shop 19,"32 check-ins Imagine a place where you can meet with a group of friends, play your favorite games, drink beer, eat snacks, and NOT have to bring your own games or spend $$$ buying your own boardgames?!  This is your new favorite place. You can play any of their multiple games they have available to play and enjoy their delicious beer on tap. They even have created a system for you to find single players for your games that would be ""more fun with 5 when you only have 4"". You place a flag on your table so people know to join you!  Their menu is very good too! They don't offer too much, but what they do offer is delicious. Tip: Their chicken salad sandwich; get it toasted! So yummy during your game. Their smoothies are raved about too. A full coffee bar is also included in the store.  Overall: Good food, good drinks (be it alcohol or otherwise), and BOARDGAMES! Who could ask for more?",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This is a really cool hidden spot! I stopped by here to kill some time before work. I grabbed myself a panini and a coffee. I'm kinda bummed I don't live closer!

Coffee Shop 19,"Good drinks, friendly atmosphere, and the game library wall. Need I say more. Buy a drink and play board and card games as long as you like. The beers on tap are all great quality with vatious ales and bottles of cider to choose from as well. My favorite on tap is the Paulaner Hefeweissen. A place the alcohol enthusiast and nerd in me can agree on.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"My fiancé and I love emerald tavern. They are a fun place to hang out with friends and try new board games. Their selection of demo games is superb as well as their menu. They have a good offering of beers and coffees, as well as decent bites for those longer gaming sessions. Their game store is well stocked too. We try to buy here whenever possible to support this great place.  My one warning: space is limited and they will not hold a table for groups. We always call ahead to get an idea of the table situation and have never had a problem.  They will hold games if you call ahead.",1
Coffee Shop 19,We never expected to find such a great place to bring a game and have food and drinks! Table space can be limited if you get there late and a couple of them are 4 person tables. The coffee's and sandwiches are great and they have a whole wall of games you can play. Great nerdy boardgame haven.,1
Coffee Shop 19,"30 check-ins I followed their progress on Facebook, and have wanted to visit for some time now. I was finally able to accomplish that goal last night, when I met up with a few friends for beer and board games. Please not, this review will not cover their food options, since I did not eat anything while I was there.  I found their selection of beer, both on tap and bottled, to be really good. Their draft choices were fairly diverse, which is a solid win in my book.  I was very impressed with how large this place was. I went in assuming it would be much smaller. Seating was fairly decent too. While not as large as Dragon's Lair, they still had room enough for a big crowd. We arrived early in the evening, so things hadn't picked yet. My friends and I were able to have our pick of tables.  They have a good variety of board games, and miniatures. I've been struggling to balance my game purchases between Dragon's Lair, Great Hall, and 10th Planet in Cedar Park. It seems that I'll need to include Emerald Tavern as well.  Overall, I enjoyed myself immensely, and will be a regular visitor. This place has great potential, and I'm excited to see it grow. Pandemic at Emerald Tavern.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Listed in Be Weird in Austin Have you been looking for some new games but don't know what to get? This place is awesome - have a drink or dinner with friends while playing games, then buy the one(s) you like- or don't! You can keep coming back and playing it there!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This place is full of epic win! First visit this last weekend. Managed to get two tables worth of friends together totaling about 10 people for multiple games over about 6ish hours.   They have game selections for both ""grab off the shelf and play where you are"" as well as ""hey, you liked this? why not take one home with you!"" buying options. An  amazing setup and very friendly to all ages and gamer flavors. While there I saw board games, card games, dice games, RPGs and laptop lan games being played. Talk about a place that caters to everyone!   ""The picnic was delicious. The champagne was excellent. Remind me to send the Cardinal a note!"" - The food and drinks were VERY shiny. I personally had my fill of both ciders and coffee with a sandwich to tide me over until dinner and was a very happy gamer. No matter how you pick your poison, they had multiple flavors of beer, cider and non-alcoholic drinks to help quench the thirst of any great adventurer. Also the prices are super reasonable and the staff exceptionally friendly!   Even if you're not in the area, this place is worth going out of your way for. Definitely recommend taking the time to stop in, grabbing a pint of something tasty and sitting down for a game or three with friends!  PS--Hope you're able to get into a bigger space soon to accommodate all the adventuring parties wanting to hang out at the same time!",1
Coffee Shop 19,This place is half board game store and half coffee shop/beer pub.  A great concept if you like to play nerdy board games and half of your friends like beer and half like coffee.    I was here on a Tuesday afternoon at 2:30pm and there was plenty of table space to play.  I can't say it will be that way at all times though as I assume it gets busier in the evenings and weekends.  It is a CLEAN place too.  There is some patio space outside and the staff is friendly.  Definitely not my usual haunt (as I don't play board games) but I saw the word coffee and assumed they had free wifi (they do).    Visit here for a clean place to play nerdy board games with friends while indulging in coffee and/or beer.,1
Coffee Shop 19,"This place is spectacular! I had only been to one other establishment that allows you to play games off the shelf (Outlaw Moon), but this was the first time I was able to do that with the option of buying coffee or beer. My boyfriend and I randomly stumbled upon this place but we were glad we did.  If you've been to Outlaw Moon already, I'd say this place offers a different selection of games. So I think you'd be able to discover something new that you may not have heard of before. We went at an odd time and yet the place was still bustling with a good crowd of people. There were only about 2 tables left completely open. Therefore it may get a bit complicated to find seating during peak times on weekends, but I can't say for sure.  Once you buy a game or beverage, you're free to grab any game off the shelf to try out. You can either grab an empty table to have your own private game with friends, put up a flag on the table to invite strangers to play, or join a table with a flag that's already playing a game. It seems like a great way to socialize and meet new people over some shared interests - while trying to beat them at something :)",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Very cool place!  I haven't yet tried the food,  but I've been in a few times for drinks and D&D scheming.  Their selection of beers and wines are kinda limited but very well-curated, and there's a very warm, welcoming atmosphere from both the staff and the clientele.  The music and lighting set up a nice atmosphere.  They even have a few tables outside; perfect when the weather's good!  Their store of games and such is cool to browse, too.  Did a bit of this year's Christmas shoppin' there.  Really the biggest issue I have with the place is that it so completely nails its objective, and people know it - so it's always packed, often hard to get a table, and I feel guilty about sticking around when I do get a spot.  Still, I'll definitely be back!  Much love for the place.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This place is pretty amazing to meet up with a group of friends and play board games you all love but are too cheap to buy. Staff have always been pleasant, the coffee is great, and it's an easy place to feel comfortable. The food is okay, nothing super special (basic sandwiches, chips, microwaved pretzels), and the beer is a bit pricey, but overall it's a great place to spend a Friday night.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Awesome drinks, food, customers playing board/card games. At present, Tues night is war game night. Crowd is generally 25% female and 75% male. Friendly players enthusiastic about board games. Not too difficult to hop into a game; however it is popular place so you want to get there early. Did I mention it has nice bathrooms?",1
Coffee Shop 19,"ROTD Four stars for innovation, but they have a long way to go. Our impressions:  The space is a long, skinny retail store conversion. There's a bar at the front with a few fancy beers on tap and many in bottles. They also make paninis and have deli snacks. There are a few aisles of games. Then the back half of the store has two clean restrooms and about six to eight large tables. Some tables are still just folding tables and folding chairs, but a few look to be of nicer wood. Get there early and grab them?  The ambiance isn't quite what I expected -- I was thinking dark and funky like Pinballz but it's more like a well-lit woodland cottage, maybe Gaelic themed. Needs more vines? The staff are very friendly and obviously play the games.  Some areas of improvement:  1) There needs to be a common area with common supplies: spare dice, plastic bowls for game pieces (like currency or marking tokens), pens and paper for scorekeeping. If they wanted to charge $1 to access this area, I'd be fine with that. Most games need some degree of tending once opened, and a few supplies would go a long way to helping make them more playable.  2) Laminated Rule Sheets or Game Guides. There are plenty of fun games to try, but without a guide, it's tough to know how to play in a casual setting. They could have serious bonus points for curating some easy setup guides or even master lists, like: if you have 4 players, try these games! A game menu, if you will, to match the beer menu.  3) Beer versus folding tables: we had some unfortunate spillage from table bumping on a busy night. Try serving everything in big Irish coffee mugs?  Overall, it's a really great idea being operated by interesting folks who care about community. Give them a try and help them get better!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Not quite what I expected (I expected more tavern than store), but this place rocks.  I came in, got myself a veggie wrap (they don't make them there, but they're really, really good), and a pumpkin beer, and went to the back wall of OMG A MILLION GAMES that you can just sit down and play.  For free.  Just try them out.  How fun!  We hung out for a few hours - staff was friendly, beer selection was super yummy, and we played a couple different really fun games.  It was a rainy Wednesday night, so it wasn't super busy, but they did have plenty of people coming in and out (some playing games, sounded like some people discussing making games, and some hanging out with the staff).  It felt comfortable, cozy, and we'll be back with some friends to occupy a table, drink some beers, and make more of a dent in their wall-o-games.  If they had their own kitchen and a slightly larger variety of food (I would have loved a side salad, some fries, soup, normal cafe fare), I would totally bump this up to 5 stars.  Love to have another nerdy place in our 'hood!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Friendly staff, delicious drinks, and a great place to play games!  We spent 2-5pm on Labor Day Monday here and it was pretty packed by the time we left. If space is frequently limited like that, they might be better off cutting down their selection of games for sale and open up more table space, but obviously that depends on what their revenue division looks like.  I didn't mind the lighting - it's perfect for games. If I want mood lighting, I'll go to a traditional coffee shop.  We didn't grab any food, so I can't comment on that.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"First to Review The space was well lit and comfortable. However, table space is limited so if you're coming to game make sure you squat a spot early. Staff was friendly and fit the vibe very well. The place is new so they're still getting the hang of things, but I like them. They have a back wall ""library"" of games you can grab and start playing which is awesome. Half of the stuff on the wall I've never had the chance to try, so this is going to be exciting.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Listed in Geek Chic I'm really loving this place and am hoping to make it a part of my weekend routine as I watch the business grow and improve. It doesn't hurt that its near to pinballz arcade, the combo totally creates the perfect nerdy date night. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the bathrooms clean, and their stock of games up-to-date. Really the only thing that bothers me about Emerald Tavern is the lighting. Its just too harsh for extended gameplay and drinking.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I stepped into another world. I hate to say I'm not nerd-core. If you are familiar with games such as Magic! Standard, Modern, Legacy, Commander, Kitchen Table, Multiplayer, Winston, Pack Wars and Mini Master this would be heaven. This is the place where people gather to play games with one another. They serve coffee, beer and sandwiches.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I went here for the first time about a month ago to try out a new table top and I instantly fell in love! The staff members were super sweet and helpful, the selection of games to try are huge, and their drinks are great! I tell everyone to check this place out and I look forward to playing a round of Magic here all thr time.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"2 check-ins I was in the mood for a mocha and decided to have a nice quiet evening alone. I arrived at 6 on a Friday (after Thanksgiving) and was immediately greeted. Excellent service! Very friendly.  The mocha was too chocolaty and too sweet (yes, there is such a thing), but I still enjoyed my visit.  They have a very nice selection of games. The place is on the small side, but I like that they keep it simple. I was hoping that there would be more 3DS people (for street passes), but I suppose it is not that kind of Game Cafe.  I'll be back to try their Italian soda!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Pros:  - Friendly staff. Though it seems there is a high turn over which kind of sucks.  - Great drink selection (though they could offer more wheat beers on tab during the summer months)  - An ample assortment of board games to play for free  Cons:  - Space is limited: I've been here on average once a week since they've opened and during that time they exploded in popularity (yay for them). However due to the popularity comes an increase demand for seating. The idea behind gaming is I shouldn't hope I can get a seat if I choose to go there, it should basically be guaranteed. ET is driving away it's main audience by limiting the amount of seats there are. Imagine how this looks to other people trying to get into gaming. It's not very inviting.  - Limited food choices: In order to make money I understand there policy on no outside food or drink. However for the last 8 times I went they've been out of over half the sandwiches. How is this really viable for your business strategy? What they do end up having are sub-par pre-made sandwiches. Either commit to having food or let us bring our own food in. It's not really fun to be playing board games with a growling stomach.  Overall I love the concept, but they need to make a decision if they are a store or restaurant/bar dedicated to board games. This 50/50 split is going to cause you business in the long run.",0
Coffee Shop 19,"Made a last minute decision to have family game night as we drove by this place. This was my first visit and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The staff was friendly - they recommended various games and even stopped by to see how it was going and answered how-to questions. I've visited other game shops with my son and felt they were more intimidating and ""stiff"" compared to Emerald Tavern. The environment seemed pretty laid back,  with folks of all ages and various game knowledge hanging out.  I've noticed other's have commented on the menu, but I feel it's a bonus that they provide food and beverage for purchase. We didn't have any complaints because we went there to play, not eat.  My 10 year old son has asked that we hold family game night at this location,  so well be back soon!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"2 check-ins Listed in Best Doods In Austin An obvious five stars because how diverse, delicious and original these guys are.  The Food: I think it is fantastic.  I have tried the Basil Pesto turkey sandwich, salami and bananas pepper, peanut butter and jelly, triple berry smoothie and they are all GOOD.  Can be hit or miss, but only about 20% of the time.  Plus their bread is so good!  They use a fantastic bread, makes it seem like they bake it in store or something.  The Staff:  I love how nerdy the staff is, because often times you can ask them about any game, and any rule and they are right there to pick up and answer that really weird question with ease.  Also, they are very easy to talk to, they often strike up conversations with you at the counter and care about your input.  The Games:  I can not believe the games they allow everyone to play for free.  This is honestly my main appeal.  I eat and drink about $10 worth of food over a 3 hours period and just play 3 or 4 games that they have on the wall.  As it stands, I looks like they have at least 50 board games you can try out and play.  I know I have played a game and then walked over and bought it for home.  The Prices:  The food prices are pretty decent, I don't drink beer, so I wouldn't really know, I suppose they are normal.  The game prices are the same prices that you would expect from any game store.  Its going to be cheaper on amazon by a couple bucks, but you can get it in the store free of shipping and support something amazing.  The times they are open are great and this place is just an already awesome place.  I just recently found it and I have been there almost 5 times in the last two weeks now.  This is my new regular spot!",1
Coffee Shop 19,Good atmosphere. Well lit which is great for gaming. Very Good selection of house games. Drinks are good. Knowledgeable staff is helpful in picking games to play or buy. Give it a shot if you're looking for something new to play or to buy.,1
Coffee Shop 19,"Emerald Tavern is a great place to hang out with friends, have a good beer, and play games. They have a great selection of demo games to play, and an OK selection of games to purchase. The beer selection is great! They are one of the few places in town where I have seen ""the duchesse"" sour beer.  I am giving 4 stars because I have not been anywhere quite like it. It is a great idea, and it is a great place for my game-loving friends and I to meet.  There are a few things to improve. The first of which is the food situation. The food is OK, but it is not made in-house. That means they can run out of popular items like the wraps. Still, I am very happy that Emerald has a panini press to warm the food up. It makes it a lot better.  Emerald almost always has a nerdy soundtrack playing, be it from Star Wars, Superman, or some other superhero movie. This fits quite nicely with the gaming theme, but it does get a bit old after one's sixth visit. It would be awesome if Emerald had a jukebox, especially if the jukebox were based on a mobile app, since it be nice to play our own playlists.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Short version: an open gaming store where you can come in and get beer or coffee while you play.  I've had a lot of fun here.  Suggestions:  - Peak times - You might want to call ahead on weekends.  They're mostly busy after 6 on Friday and Saturday, while Sunday just depends on the weekend.  If you call ahead they'll let you know how busy the place is but I'm told they don't do reservations.  - Food - Generally lackluster - eat ahead of time or walk over to Trudy's.  Pros:  - Good games selection both for public access and for a variety of tastes  - Good service, friendly atmosphere, generally a very upbeat group every time I've visited  - Drinks have been good to great.  The coffee and chocolate beverages are above average.  Cons:  - More and better food options OR let me bring my own.  Also, if you're going to make a Panini please charge me $.50 - $1.00 more and put some real cheese in there.  - I recently found out there are a list of rules on the wall.  They're about 11 pt font so you may not have noticed them either.  I don't know if this is good or bad, but it is definitely meaningless.  I think if you just put ""don't be a dick"" in big letters that would work too.  Wishlist:  - Different lighting, something a bit warmer (current lights are a standard dull white fluorescent)  One last note: word has it that the owner has a dim view of your dietary restrictions so I'm not sure what they'll say if you ask whether it's vegetarian or gluten free.  I can't stick this in the cons section as I haven't seen it first-hand and I'm already recommending against eating here.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Really cool place. This seems to be a perfect place for the dragons and wizards lovers. They have a huge selections of games that I never heard of...The coffee and the tea cafe prices and services was good. The bathrooms and the tables was super clean. I would come more often IF they added more classic games. This is definitely a signature place of  ""keeping austin weird""",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This place is great! I love the fact that I have come here with 1 or 2 people or sometimes alone and always end up playing with strangers. They have a decent beer selection (given that they are a board game shop) and although the menu is limited everything I have tried has been tasty and not overpriced.  Their board game selection is acceptable and I hope in the future they expand it. I also really enjoy the fact that they host so many events (best way to meet new people).  The only complaint I have is that there needs to be more room for tables, a place as cool as this needs more room to accommodate all of the people it is drawing in.",1
Coffee Shop 19,Great nerd times to be had by all! Delicious amazing coffee and beer. X-Files theme playing on the speakers is always a plus. Fancy clean bathrooms and games available to play for free!,1
Coffee Shop 19,"I went to this place for the first time this weekend I have to say I had a blast, the staff was super friends and helpful to someone that has never seen an establishment of this sort before.   Everyone there was super friendly and despite the fact we had some initial trouble finding a table to play on I greatly look forward to going again.   I just wish that they had more table space.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"An up-and-coming spot community spot for gaming and crafted beers. While just three months old, the crew of Emerald Tavern is working to continuously improve their stock and atmosphere. Had a chat with the two owners about their business and vision- great people with a fair bit of knowledge about the general gaming industry, and lots of beer brewing experience.  I only stopped in for a coffee, so I can't directly comment on their typical gaming events.  Fantastic beer selection, both on tap and bottled.  The the owners are garage beer brewers with aspirations of expanding Emerald Tavern to incorporate an on-site brewery.  Another indirect bonus is that if their beer selection isn't to your liking (e.g., you want a plain-Jane Bud Light), Sherlock's Pub is virtually next door.  Besides the gaming atmosphere, I'll be coming back for the off-the-norm beer selection.  While I'll ding the decor for being very spartan (lots of white wall), the place is very clean and tidy. You can see the base for Tudor revival architecture (a possible explanation for the white walls) and decoration creeping in. I have no doubts that the look and feel of place will continue to grow as the business does; give it time.  Cheers! Side 2 of their beer and wine menu. Side 1 of their beer and wine menu. Business card. See all photos from John D. for Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I don't think I've ever thought ""if only Austin had another place for tabletop gaming, it would be so nice."" This city is blessed with a very lively and active gaming scene.  Emerald Tavern is a nice little store with a game library of stuff you can use and some games you can purchase as well - the selection of games is kind of strange, as it's mostly lighter & more popular fare (Munchkin, Lords of Waterdeep, etc) but there are a few unexpected titles there as well (Combat Commander anyone?).  They seem to have a good selection of beers but I didn't try any yet. The latte I got was very good. Food options seem limited right now but I hear they're working on that.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I've spent a fair number of hours at Emerald Tavern and it's definitely been a great experience. There are a lot of good beers on tap (no Bud/Miller/etc. here, mostly English pub type stuff), ciders and coffees that don't break the bank, good sandwiches, and a very nice game library for a place that hasn't been open very long.  Table space can be an issue on the busy weekend nights, so get there early or game during the week - there's a fair amount of space on Monday nights. The staff is very friendly and while the store does have some kinks to iron out, they've been ramping up fast. I wish I had more time to hang out and play, because I love this store!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Cool place to play games with friends. The staff is very helpful with game suggestions, good beer selection.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I'm glad that another place devoted to board games opened. The concept is great. with beer, food, and well lit gaming tables. The staff is great too! Hopefully over time they will expand the space for gaming tables and move them to the front of the store.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This place is so awesome!  The moment we stepped in, we were greeted with such friendly faces! I recommend just getting the coffee without any sugar/cream. We were lucky that it had just finished brewing.. the flavor packed a kick. I wasn't really fond of the chai latte.  The aisles are filled with irregular, interesting games for purchase.  The entire back wall is lined with games that you are able to play for free! We settled on what I believe is called ""Cockroach Poker"", it's basically a game of BS. It was really fun, surprisingly.  Oh! The ladies restroom is amazingly clean.  At first when we arrived, the place was empty which made me sad since I love to see small business that have a great ambiance do well but before we knew it, the place was PACKED. Not a single empty seat.  Unfortunately, we weren't hungry so we didn't try any of the food but it did look delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This is the only place I know of where you can get beer (on tap, or bottled) or coffee, and then buy and/or play board and card games on the spot.  The lighting is tuned for good visibility on the gaming, and you can borrow from their growing library of titles.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I went on a saturday morning with my fiance and had a wonderful time - staff was easygoing, helpful, and did not hover.  I greatly enjoyed my time - plenty of table space while also having fellow gamers to play with.  Definitely check it out.  I ordered a lemonade and my fiance got a coffee - both were pretty good.  Check it out!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I've only been here once, but I'm already in love. Cool beer and cider, nice coffee and tea drinks, a modest cafe menu and a ton of free to play boardgames makes this a great place to hang out with friends. Also, they sell games here, so if you want to try before you buy, you can't do much better.  The staff is friendly, drinks are tasty, and the public game library is expansive enough to keep you coming back many many times. You can also bring your own games!",1
Coffee Shop 19,"Nice place, nice people.  The food is lacking as they don't yet have a food prep license, so everything comes out of a box.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"This place is great! Good beer and coffee choices. Great environment for playing all types of games. The staff was sooo friendly and super knowledgeable about games. It's also close to Pinballz, which means you could totally nerd arcade/pub/games crawl! You can bring your own games, or they have a wall of pretty great ones available for play.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I love Emerald Tavern, but I think they need to improve the ambiance a bit.  Unfortunately, you need decent lighting to play board games, but at the same time it makes the place less cozy than a traditional tavern.  They should remove the tables and replace them with booths that have individual lights (like Outback Steakhouse restaurants), so that the place looks more like a tavern when you walk in.  The drink selection is good, but I think they could offer a few more kinds of bottled beer.  And they need to provide some more food choices, especially healthy snacking foods.  You don't want to get fingers messy while playing board games, but it would be nice if I had more opportunities to spend money.  Normally, I just get one beer and maybe a hot chocolate and a snack.  I'd be happy to spend a lot more if they offered a lot more.  They have free wi-fi.  Ask at the counter for the password.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I've been to E.T. five times now and I'm very impressed.  The atmosphere is very nice.  Given its size, it isn't at all cramped - unlike another gaming store I know.  Points to the owners for paying attention to detail.  Some of the tables are of a nice wood construction which adds to the flavor and the Tudor theme that they are slowing bringing to light with the floor and wall accents.  Each time I go in more decor is getting added.  The thing that impressed me the most was the selection of games.  They have many of the games I've been wanting to try from BoardGameGeeks.  Bravo!  The beer selection is really nice and I hear they are adding wine soon.  The sandwiches and wraps are really good and they always bring them to my table so I don't have to miss out on any gaming.  Finally, the owners are very involved and accessible which makes me feel like it is only going to get better.",1
Coffee Shop 19,"I'm giving them a generous 4 stars because I love the idea of the place and I'm partial to them because of my board gaming hobby. I enjoy coming to be surrounded with ""my people"".  I'd like to see them reach 5 star status but for that to happen they will have to seriously step up in the food department. I think recently they have improved in the fact that they are apparently making their sandwiches in-house now. Before they were ordering them and toasting them on-site but always under-ordering for the weekend. Saturday and Sunday continually had them running out and the options for a place that doesn't allow outside grub were pretty slim. I get it. I know they don't have a full kitchen. I know there are limitations when you don't have a ventilation system. I don't know if they have a walk-in or how much space they can spare for food but we'll see how in-house sandwich prep goes.The minimal baked goods they have is sad though. I really wish they'd step up here. They seem very focused on the 'craft beer' aspect of their business (understandable because of the profit margin) but with the coffee traffic they have coming through, more attention to items that go with coffee could only improve their sales. The muffins and turnovers are just the standard grocery store stuff, full of hydrogenated fats, artificial flavorings and high fructose corn syrup. Ah, such a missed opportunity. In my pre-mom days I was a pastry chef so I just can't help imagining what great things they could sell that would put them over the top (try real homemade brownies  and cookies for one) and on par with good coffee bars. I'd be happy to offer my services wholesale :). Anyway, food is my only real beef (ha ha!). I've gotten accustomed to the set up, though initially I thought games would've been better placed along the walls to allow both more table space and a glimpse into the gaming area for those curious about our fabulous board gaming hobby (Perhaps they are trying to keep us hidden in order not to scare away the uninitiated ? :)  hahaha! Could be.). But it is what it is and it's their baby not mine so I simply wish the owners all the luck in the world because I really enjoy spending time gaming at Emerald Tavern and hope they're around a long time.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"A true gem of ""real"" Austin with the friendliest staff and the greatest selection of delicious foods and beverages.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This place has everything!!  To be more specific, LOTS of booze variety, and also amazingly filling breakfast tacos.  These are a MUST if you are nearby and looking to save some money.  It may not be your fancy dining setup or this huge page by page menu of food items, just simple breakfast tacos.  Can choose from potato, bacon, sausage, ham, and I think another one but these are the most popular off the menu.    Take everything you THINK about breakfast tacos from an establishment and try these out.  Here's the thing.  These are not gourmet breakfast tacos so no fancy flavors or kale and what not.  These aren't dirty mexican tacos where the cheese has a miraculous way of hiding the meat.  Not, just a nice, simple, great, filling, legitimate, savory, satisfying, affordable, honest breakfast taco.  The Live Oak Market is also a great place to find some unique drinks to stock up on.  Never thought I'd see so many different root beers!  Everything else in between like milk and orange juice and nail clippers you will find in any other liquor store, but I like this place.  Wherever I plan to crash, stay, borrow, live, or rent in Austin, I want to make this place my go to spot for stocking up on drinks or enjoying, once again, an honest breakfast burrito. No joke, this is actually bacon bacon w/green sauce dots.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"O.g. Austin right here.  They have all of the craft beers that you could ever want, tons of local beers, local soaps, food and so on.

Live Oak definitely has a few of my favorite things inside of it, so let me explain.  This is not your average convenient store.  You may find the prices might be a bit higher, but you will also notice the quality of the products in the store.  They have have an awesome grill that makes some pretty delicious sandwiches!    The first time I came here way back when was my friend wanted me to try the Cuban sandwich ... wow ... I loved it so much and then continued to stop in here continually.  I have also had the Reuben and the Turkey Basil Bacon, which are both spectacular as well.    Another reason they are my favorite place is the selection of craft beers.  Not only do they have craft beer, but they carry all kinds of specialty drinks, which sometimes I am in the mood for.    I also love the desserts I find in this store.  At the front counter they have these locally made coconut macaroons that are half covered in chocolate...mmm.  Also at the font they have Full English millionaire bars usually .... these may seem expensive but are worth every penny ... simply the best thing ever!  Plus they are made local a few blocks away at the Full English Cafe.  More of my favorites in here are the ice cream selections, soaps, chocolate and popcorn!

You probably don't desire exotic soda daily but you can get it here! Also--I was looking for something that stood out, I saw an Icehaus ice cream sandwich that looked beautiful and OMGosh.....it was AMAZING! It took me 3 days to finish, it was so awesome, over $5 for an ice cream sandwich is a bit much but you get what you pay for!",1

Coffee Shop 41,"Great funky spot in South Austin. They have great selection of beers...amazing breakfast tacos and sandwiches. I like to order my sandwiches over the phone and pick them up because it is a bit slow due to the lunch crowd, but definitely worth it! My favorite is the Reuben!  On weekends and nights, they turn the music up real loud and jam out, so be prepared if running in to grab something. This is a South Austin gem! Prices may be a bit high but it's better than a 7/11 any day!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This is a whole different animal, this corner store.  I fell for this place from the first visit.  It's fabulous.  I'm not from Austin but I visit regularly.  I always shed a slight tear when I leave town and see Live Oak Market in my rearview mirror.  I wish they had a place like this where I live: A converted convenience store that sells legitimate, quality food, great coffee, tacos, sandwiches and so much more. It's a brilliant concept that makes eating healthy food convenient, something that a lot of people struggle with.  They have a real grill right behind the counter and prepare food right there. All this in the space of a standard 7-Eleven.    Service is oh-so-friendly and the quality of everything is great.  The facility is clean and they've got a huge selection of everything, including beers, wines, and exotic sodas, ginger ales, root beers, etc.  They have a personal items section with a wide array of natural toiletries in case you run out of aluminum free deodorant or patchouli oil (I'm talking to you, hippie!).  Smokers, they have every pack of organic, natural, exotic cigarette you can imagine and a variety of smoking essentials. My personal favorite tid-bit:  It's smack dab in the parking lot of a Randall's store (in your face, regular grocery store!).  Seriously, though, I love this because it's a nice enough Randall's so if, by some odd chance, there's something you can't get here, there's an option nearby and that particular Randall's is not the worst one around.  Co-locating is a good thing in this case.  There are chairs and tables out front and there are plenty of places to park a bike with a reasonable level of security (and being able to see it), very important for me.  I love this place.  I love, love, love this place.  Live Oak Market should be the model for similar stores and, when you're ready to bring your concept elsewhere, I'll be your first customer.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"From the outside, Live Oak doesn't seem very fancy on the outside. But it doesn't matter because this is one of the stores which have unique flair to it. It's almost as if you don't have to have a fancy exterior.  Live Oak is a convenience store where they sell organic food and products, campy drinks (I dare anyone to drink the Ranch soda), a good selection of beer and wine, and good sandwiches made to order. I was on my way to class I swore I could have started grocery shopping. But first, food before I head to class. I bought the bacon, turkey and basil sandwich which was good and satisfying. If I didn't have somewhere to go, I would have sat outside. If anyone lives close to this area, I would be constantly shopping there almost every week. This will be going into someone's Christmas stocking. Holy wine! I dare anyone to try these sodas. See all photos from Bernadette D. for Live Oak Market",1

Coffee Shop 41,"Listed in The Yelp 100 Challenge Great place to start before a full day of drinking :)  This place was on the way to 512 brewery from the hotel I was staying.  For the price you can't beat what you get.  I can't say they were amazing or anything different from other breakfast tacos I have had in the past though.  For a two bucks a piece you can get three or four tacos and leave with a full tummy for sure.  The coffee was pretty good too.  Don't expect this place to win any foodie flavor awards but if you are in the area and need something decently quick to eat for a great price this is your spot.  I do not suggest the Cubano though.  The pork they used did not taste right to me.  Couldn't tell exactly what it was but it just didn't taste right.  Go get the tacos and try a few different combinations for a hot, quick, filling meal. the sign to look for See all photos from Robert A. for Live Oak Market",1
Coffee Shop 41,"It's unfair to call Live Oak Market a convenience store. The diverse craft beer selection is top shelf. As evidenced by the locally produced bison and quail sausage, the menagerie of high end snacks is top shelf. The staff is top shelf. The music is top shelf. Nora Jones and the Clancy Brothers in the span of 10 minutes?  And the food...The sandwiches are top shelf. There are about a dozen to choose from and they're all made to order. Seriously, why go to Subway when you can get a Cubano with fresh, top shelf ingredients for less than the cost of a footlong. Sure, Live Oak Market is convenient, but it's orders of magnitude more refined than a garden variety 7-11. Plus, it's locally owned and operated.",1

Coffee Shop 41,"In addition to having every kind of organic and or local snack/meal/bevie you could want (read every other review), it should be noted they have every single kind of chocolate imaginable. Bacon chocolate? You betcha. Chocolate with crystallized ginger? Yup. Chocolate with toffee and pretzels? Yes sirree. It's not the chocolate section at Whole Foods, but it's damn near close.  I'm new to the area and only pulled in here twice, both times in a bit of an ""emergency"" situation. (Yes, bacon chocolate - or rather, the lack thereof - is in fact a life or death situation.) Both times Live Oak came through. I look forward to going back when I have a bit more time to wonder and drool.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Wow. Stopped here out of desperation because we were starving and passing by. Seemed odd that a convenience store had such high ratings, but now I completely understand why. The breakfast tacos were so good we ended up stopping again for lunch on the way home. The green homemade sauce was outstanding and our sandwiches were delicious!!! Not to mention the amazing selection of beer including Jester King bottles. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. If I'm ever back in Austin, I'll go out of my way just to come back here!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Om nom nom nom!!! That's all I have to say about their fresh tacos and salsa!! I stop in here for breakfast on my way to work and usually end up picking up enough for the whole office. They approve too!  On my way home, I grab a six pack - because they have an intense selection of local brews. I mean intense! All of their snackies are usually somewhat healthyish for you; gluten free, organic, local, all that stuff pretentious Austinites love.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Started this review months ago and never finished. Awesome place! Do not pass up an opportunity to get a sammich here!,1
Coffee Shop 41,This is a gem you don't expect from the outside. Delicious sandwiches and some awesome beer selections and oddity foods.  A must go to again and again.  It's yummy!!,1

Coffee Shop 41,"I get breakfast tacos here wayyyyyy more often than I should because they're so delicious. Great beer and wine selection. Great staff. I love this place. With all the new spots going up around town, Live Oak Market has a vibe of the Austin I grew up in...that's a very good thing.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Neat little place offering all kinds of worldly goodies.,1
Coffee Shop 41,"Excellent grilled cheese and Cuban. They have a great variety of kombucha and chocolate as well. If you're looking for something different, try Live Oak. Great for lunch or for a snack.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"2 check-ins I cant believe i have NOT reviewed this gem of a store yet. I am at Live Oak Market at least 3-4 times a week and on occasion hit them twice for a hot coffee and dee-lish breakfast taco (trust me you WANT SALSA) then again in the evening to nab a cold cider to take home. All you Paleo people, they have the best cider selection in South Austin.  They have the most random yet amazing selection of everything from Kombucha to beer to chips to jerky. They support local and carry several things made and produced right here in Austin. The staff is friendly and eager to help or suggest things for you to try in addition to filling requests and suggestions on items they should stock.  Oh.... and the soundtrack! Always the best JAMS at Live Oak Market. One Monday morning they were rockin out to Rammstein  and the next day playing Selena then Stevie Wonder. The music is all over the map but always killer. Any given day you can see at least 2 people singing along to whatever is playing.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Wow is the beer overpriced in this place. Actually everything is overpriced and the area is currently overrun with vagrants.  Had trouble parking because the parking lot was crowded with homeless people.,0
Coffee Shop 41,"5 check-ins Not your average cornerstore...  The three best things about Live Oak Market? The cuban sandwich, cool haus ice cream sandwiches, and the eclectic selection of stuff they offer. Man that Cuban sandwich... only time in my life I have driven to a cornerstore for a sandwich,  They have too many cool and unique snacks/drinks/food here to list, so I'll just list some of the words that differentiate their inventory from other cornerstores: organic, fair trade, imported, rare, unique, interesting, unexpected. Just come here and browse around for 20 minutes. I guarantee you will find something that you will buy.  And while their stuff is pretty much all great, they are a little pricey. So that is the only reason why this is not a 5 star review.  But man $6.99 for the best cuban sandwich I've had? That's a great deal. Come get some!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"9 check-ins Listed in The South Side, 5 Star Flava, BFFs This place is my jam.  Why yes I did move to a new neighborhood and Live Oak Market is relatively close by and I love it. The staff? SUPER nice, always willing to help, and smiling. I want to be friends with them and hang out sometime. Beer and wine selection? Hot dog they will have whatever you are looking for and more. Don't drink? They have a ton of different sodas. You're hungry? Their sandwiches are so so good and they make them until midnight what more could you ask for?!!  Sigh. I love great convenience stores. They make life so much better.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Awesome all around!!  I'm in the area for only a few days and found this place on yelp. There are a few things to note.  1. The sandwiches are incredible. The cashier recommended the turkey, basil, Swiss. Great choice!! This is one of the best sandwiches I've eaten anywhere and certainly the best ""gas station food"" I've found. 2. This is a convenient store. Snacks, drinks and cigarettes are standard, but these guys carry everything else too... Local made soap, gourmet chocolate, specialty foods, etc. Shop around while you wait on your order! Turkey Bacon Swiss",1
Coffee Shop 41,"My go to spot for a quick lunch or bite to eat.  I have never been for breakfast,  but oh my, they do a Cubano so damn well.  Very consistent, I eat here at least twice a week.  The reuben is great as well, and the store in general is cool as all hell.  They have a sweet beer selection also, including many great craft single beers iced down and ready to go!  Absolutely my favorite spot in Austin",1
Coffee Shop 41,"7 check-ins Live Oak Market is what the Whip In used to be... An awesome convenience store with a great beer selection. Its nice, now that Whip In is turning more into a bar that someone is rising up  to take their place and fill the niche they created.  I cant say enough about the beer selection here, they have everything your looking for an some stuff you don't even know you want yet. They tend to hold on to some seasonal selections well after the season is over too.  The sandwiches are super awesome,I especially love the Reuben.. its not your traditional Reuben it has something that makes it very spicy. I kinda feel like its a good South Austin twist on a Reuben. I hear the other sandwiches are equally as impressive.  The only negative to shopping here is its easy to spend lots of cash, now I will say you do get what you pay for, which is great quality! There's more here than beer and sandwiches also.. if I can stop being distracted by the beer I might try some other stuff someday. Store Front!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This place is pretty awesome, though pricey. But hey, that's what you get with a corner store, right?  What makes them so awesome, you ask? Well, simply put its the selection. The literally have it all. Everything any hipster could ever want. Even gluten-free burritos in the freezer section. No, I'm not kidding.  They have ALL the sodas. They have ALL the cigarettes. They have ALL the chocolate. And the people that work there are all very sweet. I actually stop by there when I indulge in the occasional cigarette, because they have the most delicious ones. And if you're going to kill yourself, it might as well be gourmet.  Seriously though, their selection is better than the Randall's right beside them. Its also much quicker to get in and out comparatively. So do yourself a favor and just go in Live Oak Market if you only need a few things. Or if you're looking for the special vice.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Delicious sandwiches. Yummy tacos. Love their coffee on those mornings I have to grab a cup. They have an awesome selection of beverages and snacks. Fun music and pleasant staff. Love this spot!,1
Coffee Shop 41,"This is NOT your typical convenient store.  While the typical place will have Cheetos and Dr. Pepper's, this store has a lot of things you can't even find on the Whole Foods shelves, like local pie cookies or sweet shredded coconut balls (not their official name, but they are delicious and found by the register).  Not only do they have a great selection of snacks like kale chips, every kind of protein/power bar, and great selections of kombuchas and juices, but they also have a great wine and beer selection, including the new gluten-free beer, Omission,  AND they serve tacos and sandwiches made to order!  By far, one of the best, if not the best, local convenient stores I have ever had the pleasure of going to.  The staff is always kind and courteous.  And their selection is like non other.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"I think someone is likely being asked to write reviews because this has an overall four stars... And in Austin where there's a lot of good breakfast tacos, these are subpar. I got a cold store bought flour tortilla with eggs and canned black beans and cold shredded cheese. The salsa was good though.",0
Coffee Shop 41,The world would be a better place with more Live Oak Markets. Killer craft beer and local snack selection. I got a turkey reuben and a grilled cheese. I'll be back for some scratch breakfast tacos.,1

Coffee Shop 41,"29 check-ins Somehow a Live Oak Market review has slipped through the cracks sometime in the last 4 years.    This place is the beverage haven.  If you are thirsty for a beverage, alcoholic, or nonalcoholic alike then you should look no further than here.  I have discovered numerous things that I have never had before like Barton Springs Root Beer, Black Water, Newcastle Bombshell/Werewolf.  (since the initial discovery here I have found the Barton Springs soda and Newcastle seasonals in other locations).  I have even bought a Sweet Corn Soda here. (I have a corn tattoo so this was awesome, read my review of Southside Tattoos).  I have not had the breakfast tacos but judging from the other reviews it sounds like I am missing out, maybe I will try them this weekend.",1
Coffee Shop 41,They sell everything here! It's the cutest organic convenient store. I came here for a quick lunch and ended up buying a lot of random stuff like vegan gummies. Their turkey basil bacon sandwich is the bomb! Their Sammies are kind of like paninis. I can't wait to try the breakfast tacos. Healthy gummies!,1
Coffee Shop 41,"2 check-ins Live Oak market is a very nondescript place on Manchaca. Don't get fooled by the outside appearance, this place has some amazing eats.  I go in here quite frequently for breakfast tacos. They are made fresh and are delicious! They give salsa with it too. From what I've heard, they grow a lot of their vegetable behind the building and all their food is local. They have great coffee too!  I've gotten their sandwiches once. They have only one veggie option, but who doesn't love a delicious grilled cheese! They ask you for the type of cheese you'd like and even added tomatoes on request.  Another thing, the people working here. They are extremely friendly and so helpful. I've only been greeted with smiling faces and polite words!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"2 check-ins There are a few reasons why I like this market, namely the cool staffers. the hard-to-find artisan fountain sodas and a fairly legit craft beer selection. But forget all that - come here for the BOMB ASS sandwiches.  Which one's the best? I asked one of the employees a similar question and I got a 'they're all great'. I guess it's like asking a parent which child is their favorite. Anyhow, I have yet to eat my way through the entire menu, but I can vouch that the Turkey Basil Bacon Sandwich is the kind of masterpiece that'll inspire you to race through those yellow-melting-into-red traffic signals*.  Oh yes - and don't leave without checking out the imported candy section.  *Please don't follow my lead. I'm a chick and can cry my way out of a speeding ticket. Not that it's ever worked.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Listed in 2013 Review Challenge, Austin, My Austin Now this is a corner market!  I'm pretty sure this place has a better beer selection than the Spec's down the road. OK, maybe not as many beers, but quality and variety is amazing. Hard to find Jester King, Dogfish, North Coast, and many other craft beers can often be found here. Probably not the cheapest option in the world, but hey, they've got it when other places might not. My friend lives nearby and I'm always amazed at what he finds here.  The people working here have always been really nice too. They can be a rough-around-the-edges looking crew, but always good people. And the music you'll hear here can be quite entertaining at times. So stop on by sometime and check them out.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere and just plain good vibes from the crew that works there. I'm always greeted with a smile and they are always boogieing to great music that helps lift my mood whenever I stop in.

Live Oak market rules!",1
Coffee Shop 41,Very badass General Store! There tacos are made there and surprisingly very delicious! Not to mention their $6 sandwiches.. The turkey basil bacon is off the chain!  Def worth a visit and your time.,1
Coffee Shop 41,"Grateful for all the selections,  always great music going in the morning,  and awesome Cuban sandwich!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Very well-stocked and clean neighborhood market.  Excellent selection of healthy foods.  Great old-world-style deli area.  Friendly staff, too.  And they make a great cuban sandwich that rivals ""The Cuban"" from Toasties Subs, although it's not as massive.  Hardly any place to sit, however, so plan on getting your sandwich to go. The ""El Cubano"" - $6.99. Very tasty and perfectly pressed. Sandwich bread is top notch. Rivals ""The Cuban"" from Toasties. Jam-packed with goodies Gourmet local popcorn!

The hot coffee is gas station cheap, but way better quality, with real milk/cream/almond milk available and raw sugar too. Love.",1

Coffee Shop 41,"Great selection of local goods, solid beer selection, but what really stands out about this place is the sandwiches they offer. Their Cuban sandwich is one of the better ones out there, especially considering it's coming from a convenience store, and not a full-blown restaurant.  Beyond that, the staff has never been anything but friendly to me, whether I'm asking for recommendations or just want to chat. I try to stop in every time I'm on this side of town.",1

Coffee Shop 41,"Chances are, you're not using Yelp to find out which is the best convenience store. But on the off chance that you're on the south side and you're faced with the dilemma of where to go, be fortunate that yelp has led you here.  Live Oak Market is the best convenience store in South Austin. Possibly in the rest of the city as well. It is so good that I go here when it's inconvenient as well. Why? Because the beer selection is better than any of the nearby stores. I like to look at this as the convenience store version of the Central Market that's not too far away.  The food is good and not your typical fare. Very hippy type stuff, and also a lot of unusual things and local brands. Do you know of another place in Austin that carries srichacha flavored peas? Nor do I. How about semi-rare root beers?  And let's be honest-the real reason I go here? The beer. I get most of the beer for my house here, because I don't drink swill. And if you're intimidated by good beer-the workers here can talk about it forever. I haven't really spent time ordering food and just hanging around, but I'm sure I could.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"16 check-ins This is a cool, authentic ""Austin"" place - not a 'chain' but run by dudes who have interesting tastes, not only in how to stock a convenience store (lots of local products, WIDE range of craft beers, even good soap..) but also in their selection of the Reggae blasting in the background.  I understand that the sandwiches are good (never tried 'em) but I generally drop by for Virgil's Zero Root Beer (Stevia sweetened) that I can't find anywhere else in town. They also have Fentiman's Botanically Brewed sodas to go with the array of flavored popcorn on display throughout the store.  My only gripe are the prices - a tad high. And there are sometimes grifters and deadbeats bumming people for moolah (they are aggressive at times).",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This store is awesome. It's so Austin-the real one not the new, trendy version we live in now. Awesome selection you'd have trouble finding many other places and convenient location. Lots of healthy stuff and none of the crap you'd find at a 7-11.Even food made to order which is delicious. Good beer selection! I live and work nearby but I have and will go out of my way to come here.",1

Coffee Shop 41,"Live Oak, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 1) AMAZING sandwiches---the 290 club and Cubano are my faves. 2) Incredible selection of beer, healthy snacks, and LOCAL products. 3) Super friendly staff that are like family to me  I spend way too much money here because I'm in almost every day. When you're wanting a quick lunch, a new tasty beer, or hangover cures go to this cute little market and you'll find anything your heart desires. They're more pricey than your average 7-11, but what they have is worth so much more! I'm thankful everyday that this place is *my* neighborhood market.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"18 check-ins Not sure I can really say anything that hasn't been said that is positive.  They have a nice selection of beer, and apparently the PAH knee KNEES are off the chain as well.    I guess I should just stop beating around the bush, I like to drink and the Oak is local to my place so I can walk here and get my fix if need be.    Staff is pretty cool, in their own hipster way.  Maybe it's because I always come in incognito, so I may be treated with indifference because I am a master of disguise.  Or maybe I haven't been reading the hipster code of ethics, so I may be missing the point all the way around.  At least homeboy that speaks to me in Japanese has the pronunciation correct of whatever words he chooses to say to me.  Good thing I haven't forgotten ALL of my Japanese...unchi (look it up).........",1
Coffee Shop 41,"The people is this store are ALWAYS super friendly and amazing. I love coming here just to look at all the cool stuff they sale. It's by far more than a local convenience store. I love this place. If you need good food or great beer and live near, you should totally go!",1

Coffee Shop 41,"90 check-ins Love Live Oak Market! I have lived in the Austin area since 2008 but have discovered this gem only within the last 12 months. I love their wide selection of local & craft beers. They also keep a good rotation of ""good beers"" on ice up front. They do not have a ""make your own 6 pack"" option here, but you can find 6 or more different craft beers in that front ice bucket.   I honestly have not tried their food but will make it a point to do so in the near future. Live Oak also has other local merchandise available for sale, ranging from snacks & ice cream to coffee & organic products; enough to satisfy even the most hipsterfied of south-Austinites! Next week Live Oak will be launching a second location of a different name, on the corner of S.Congress Ave/ Live Oak St (ironic!) & look forward to checking out to see if this other store will have the same ""south Austin feel"" that Live Oak has.   To sum it up: I wish I would have discovered Live Oak market sooner!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This review is solely about the breakfast service.  I used to come here every weekday morning for breakfast tacos and coffee on my way to work. A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift, and since then the service at breakfast has declined sharply.  The guy who used to run the counter at breakfast was cheerful, courteous, and FAST. There were plenty of all the different types of tacos wrapped and ready to go, and I could grab my coffee, choose my tacos, pay and leave in less than five minutes, usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet.  The first time I went since that guy left, there were two new guys, one running the counter and the other preparing the tacos. Both of the kinds I usually get weren't ready, and the taco prepper took a while to make the tacos, then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready. I stood there for several minutes until the cashier noticed the bag sitting there, even after I told him they were ready and had been set down.  The last time I went there, there was only one customer ahead of me in line, who looked tense and irate, waiting for the same ""taco prepper"" guy from the previous time to fix his tacos (he usually wears a bandana on his head). This time he was also running the register. I got my coffee, waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid.  The guy came and took my order, started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my tacos. Then he asked me if I was okay (I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed), and I told him I was just in a rush. Then he loudly said that they're never in a rush at Live Oak Market, and I told him that they used to be, and that I used to be able to get my order quickly. He told me to have a nice day, and I left.  I've worked in customer service for years, including working as a barista at a busy coffee shop, and I find the notion that ""rushing"" during what is known as ""rush hour"" on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable. The primary reason people stop there is because, yes, the tacos are good and so is the coffee, supporting local businesses is important, AND because you can jump out of your car, grab your food and coffee, and get back on the road in five minutes or less (or you should be able to, rather). If you're not prepared to ""rush"" between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m. on a weekday, and you're serving breakfast and coffee, then you're in the wrong business.  Luckily, a family owned taco truck opened directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot. Their tacos are less expensive, taste much better, the staff is friendly, and they're always ready when you get there. So, no more Live Oak for me in the mornings. I make my own coffee and get tacos across the street.  (During the rest of the day, the staff is great, and I still love the store in general, but I hope they replace their early morning staff.)",0

Coffee Shop 41,"I have been here many times, but this time  my girlfriend and I had a conversation with the clerk about Selena and her ""amazing body."" Lets just say I love this place. Their sandwiches are some of the best in town. The soda selection is also amazing ( I recommend Barton springs root beer). They have great beers and strange hippy snack food as well. However, my favorite part about going is the characters who work there. I always seem to have an interesting conversation, whether it is music, beer, wine, or Selena. It isn't your run of the mill convenience store. If you're on northern Manchaca you should definitely stop by.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Dropped by this place for the first time based on reviews on their beer selection and I have to say their selection is amazing! They have all of the great local craft beers and then some. Didn't check out their other offerings but the place looked chill and the staff was super cool. This place is going to become my regular drop in spot for drinks. Seriously even better than Spec's with a much higher cool factor. Makes me love South Austin even more.,1
Coffee Shop 41,"4 check-ins it is easy to drop some dough in here.  like a hippie 7- eleven with slamming sandwiches, this place always makes me happy.    a truly unique austin business, they cater to the hipsters with well chosen, specialty products.  From craft beers, ciders and good wines to all natural, import and local food products - it is all good.  I particularly like that they carry a bottled thai coffee, 3 or 4 electrolyte waters, a variety of funky, tasty sodas, goats milk ice cream and a variety of kombuchas.  They have some of my favorite local austin snacks, like the PB&J bars, dulce de leche coconut macaroons and the like.    They also have locally made products like soaps and candles.  There are general groceries, like annie's boxed macaroni and halo all natural dog foods.    They make reallly tasty sandwiches.  I like the curry chicken salad, the cuban and the turkey bacon basil.    You can easily put together a wonderful gift basket at this store, get some nommy snacks for self and friends or grab a sandwich for lunch or grab some provisions to make dinner.    The staff is very friendly,  there are more new faces than normal lately.  They tend to try all the products in the store and will gladly recommend a wine (Hombre), beer, candy, soda  or the like.  There are regulars a plenty at this location, it can get busy.    Oh, and they have a wifi and a few chairs/tables in front of the store.  With all this in mind, i gotta give 'em a 5, as there is no better convenience store in Austin.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"I absolutely love this place!!! There needs to be more places like this! I love being able to run in and grab all organic snacks, delicious organic food and top it off with a natural soda or dessert.

Coffee Shop 41,"53 check-ins Listed in South Side Swaggin I thought I had written a review on this place because I haunt it so much, especially when it gets close to midnight and I'm out bar-hopping and realize there's no drank at home for the afterparty.  These people truly care about their customers and supporting local vendors. My fiancee absolutely loves their unique beer and wine selection. And finally, their tacos and salsa are ChiQuiBaby approved. South Austin, baybay!!! You've got to be kidding me. They must know I'm brown.... The rep for Ska Brewing is here! Totally cool dude! Try the Mole beer! Makeshift purse hook.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Live Oak is in my neighborhood. Great snack and beer selection! The staff is always super friendly. Live Oak for life!,1
Coffee Shop 41,"This place rocks!  Having just moved here a couple weeks ago, this was my first time in the store. My Austin friends have been talking about it since I arrived, and today we finally made it in. I am so glad we did.  It was one of the friendliest shopping experiences I've had in a long time. The minute I walked in, I was greeted by a very nice dude who gave me a high five and welcomed me to Live Oak. I wandered over to wine (awesome selection!) and another dude came over and spent a good five to ten minutes telling me about their wines and the history of different vineyards and what's special about which bottles. Clearly I didn't understand what Live Oak was all about, because it was a little surprising to get such informed and interesting help choosing a bottle of wine at a convenience store. He really knew his shit, and was also just really nice and funny. We spent probably 20 minutes browsing around and trying to decide what to buy. There were so many great options to choose from!  I hear they have great coffee and great sandwiches. They also have wifi. You could probably hang out there. The great selection and prices is reason enough to go there regularly, but the people that work there make it feel like somewhere you want to be all the time.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Live oak is the best! Awesome sandwiches, beer, munchies and the staff is always playing good music! It's a gem!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"4 check-ins I will preface this review by saying I have never liked soda.  I despise it at all costs.  I have never liked it- the carbonation is what makes me shudder.  When I was a kid, I used to throw a fit at birthday parties if someone gave me a Sprite by mistake instead of water.  I just plain don't like soda.  That being said, I, TOO, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  This store is full of really cool, hard to find sodas for those in my life who drink them.  I initially stepped in the store during the Great Dublin Dr. Pepper Murder and was able to pick up a few cases at retail for our family's special occasions.  Many other places were taking advantage of the Dublin drink, marking up the price in stores and on Ebay.  Nope, this place was very fair and not-greedy, so it prompted me to come in and wander more often.  I have brought home an array of sodas for my loved one and his friends.  Some of them are stranger than others.  Triple XXX Root Beer is a classic find, but we've also come home with PB&J Soda (yes, Peanut Butter & Jelly).  There is also a great selection of non-carbonated beverages, many of which I have yet to try because their collection is so extensive.  I've never tried the food from behind the counter, but it always smells delicious.  I find this place a good place to try new chocolates.  I recently came across bricks of Côte-d'Or dark chocolate that are so decadent and hard to share.  They also have Kinder products (no eggs, though).  Of course there is always Emergency Chocolate, too.  So overall, I absolutely love this store, even though I dislike carbonated bevvys.  If you have never stepped inside, I encourage you to step inside.  You'll probably come out with something awesome.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Best convenience store in Austin (Sorry I'm not sorry Royal Blue)! The staff is SUPER friendly and kind. I always walk into the store with a warm greeting. This place has everything from all kinds of Kombucha flavors and even growlers of them, but the beer selection at Live Oak is what has me hooked! Definitely South Austin's greatest gem! Thanks for all your hard work guys, keep it up!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Good beer and assorted drinks, cool dudes, and some of the BEST sandwiches you will ever have! Theres a Randalls right behind it where you can find cheap crappy beer, but buy local and support one of the best markets in town! :)",1
Coffee Shop 41,I can't begin to describe how thankful I am  that this neighborhood market is right around the corner.  Pros: - Locally owned and they go out of their way to support Texas small businesses - Staff is friendly and pretty knowlegeable. They have helped me obtain a few rare beers I couldn't get anywhere else. - Their is Turkey Basil Bacon Sandwich is yummy (I hear people love the BLT as well) -They also have Saint Arnold's Root Beer which is very very good if you never had it before.  Cons: - Prices tend be a little high - I want to buy too much when I'm there  Over all the pros outweigh the con's and that makes me a very happy person.,1
Coffee Shop 41,its a cool place if it was not aimed to please the hipsters.... The guy with the bandana is a dead give away.It seems to me like he gets along with hipsters better than a real actual home grown laid back Austin native.  I'll hit up Central Market more often since they have just as much of a variety and actually have some better prices for the same things.,0
Coffee Shop 41,"These guys know how to rock a pannini, and are some of the friendliest folks you'll ever meet.  The soda selection alone is a reason to stop by, but they also have a plethora of beer and items you wouldn't expect in a convenience store.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"I love this place. I stop in every day or two for a pack of cigarettes, a glass bottle sarsaparilla, some times I even get a sammich.  The guys that work here are friendly and they have lots of Austin kooky type stuff like local candles and treats. They carry a great selection of beers as well as glass bottle sodas.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Friendly staff, good selection of products to choose from :) They carry the yummy chocolate chip gelato I like, and good local beer selection!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"I have been stopping by this place since it  first opened for my morning coffee and tacos. Probably the best convienance store coffee in town and the tacos are fresh and yummy . I don't drink beer much as I used to these days but if beer selection is your thing then this place has it all . Tons of brews and even tons of munchies , and insects coated in bacon flavor if your into the hunter gatherer diet. You can buy cigars here also. About the only things they don't sell here are Hookers and Weed. My favorite South Austin Hippie Mart for sure.",1
Coffee Shop 41,Best sandwiches and customer service hands down. The staff are always super upbeat and happy. Eat here! Shop here! Do it.,1
Coffee Shop 41,"Listed in My Neighborhood Bad news first: This goods this place sells are VERY marked-up.  You can expect to pay a bit more for just about everything than anywhere else.    OK, now that that is out of the way, I can tell you why, despite the cost, I can't seem to stop myself from going in there every day.    The quality and variety of the stuff they offer is amazing.  You won't just find ice cream here, you'll find organic goat's milk ice cream.  you won't just find soap here, you'll find all-natural locally made soap.  The list goes on and on.  Their beer selection does not beat Whip-In's, but it is still far and beyond any other store of its scale in town.  The guys working there are always friendly and knowledgable about what the store sells.  They genuinely seem to take pride in what the store offers, and are happy to see you walking through the door appreciating it.  I don't know if they are owners of the joint or not, but that says a lot nowadays.    Their sandwiches, while not stellar, are pretty good.  In fact, I'm heading over there now to grab a six pack and a ruben! Live Oak Market during their lunch rush.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Excellent craft brew selection with a wide variety of styles, some of which you can't get elsewhere. Chill environment with a local flavor. They even have great handmade hot sandwichs! Wonderful place to stop by for great drinks and friendly faces.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This is probably the coolest convenience store I've ever been in....yeah, that's not saying a lot because there's typically nothing really cool about a convenience store, right?  But this one....this is a whole different thing!  First, their sandwiches are freaking amazing -- this is what brought us in originally.  As we pulled up, I thought, ""Hmmm, maybe we should look somewhere else, this doesn't look very promising"", but something made us go in.  We ordered sandwiches and while we were waiting for them to be made, we took around.  Not only does this place have amazing (and addicting) sandwiches, but they have a great selection of beer and various candies and other goodies that you can't find just anywhere.  Not to mention, everyone was super friendly and they had some awesome music playing as well.  So yeah, this isn't your typically convenience store -- it's full of awesome and if I lived in Austin, I'd be in there all the time!",1
Coffee Shop 41,"This place makes me want to move just so I can be closer to it haha By far my favorite convenience store EVER! The service was amazing. All the employees there were just the nicest and most helpful people and was obvious they truly just wanted to see me leave happy.  They have the coolest selection of items from an organic, vegan, agave cola. To choclate kale. All the Austinites would love all the weird options.  The most important thing. The paninis are awesome. I think they're a little too expensive for just the panini. It was like 6 dollars. but they're still really good. They still were surprisingly filling. They put a lot of food pressed in that tiny sandwich lol. I recommend the reuben or cuban as they will too.  They also have breakfast tacos but I haven't tried them.",1
Coffee Shop 41,"Listed in South Austin treasures Did you know that Live Oak is the best store on the face of the planet. OK... that might be an exaggeration. But how about the best convenience store in South Austin.  I have lived at my current house for over 2 years and there isn't a week that goes by that I don't visit Live Oak. What keeps be going back time and time again? Great beer and wine selection, fun ice cream choices, good music that makes you dance down the isles, great coffee, never ending soy candles and yummy breakfast tacos are all 4 star winners in my mind, but the guys who work here are awesome 5 star staff.  I have been to other ""hip"" convenience stores with cool beers and yum food but their staffs are cliquey and only give the ""regulars"" quality customer service.  At Live Oak the guys know how to make you feel welcome if it's your first time or your 70th time and they are what keeps me coming back time and time again.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Wish I could be a regular to this delightful joint. The service, atmosphere, and food are all the best. Waking up in the morning, strolling over to this cafe and chowing down on a veggie-packed Bagelwich and hot Latte would turn anyone into a loyal customer in only a few bites. The funky furniture adds a cool touch- an easy spot to meet up with a friend and sit like debutants on a velvety high back chair. There were also some hula hoops for sale, as well as an outdoor space that looks perfect for large parties.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I ventured here for lunch a few weeks back. Parking is a bit tricky, as there is a small lot and the rest is street parking which is pretty congested on a weekday afternoon.  The inside space is cozy with limited seating. On a nice day, there is outdoor seating as well.  The menu is creative with a Middle Eastern flair, meets healthy Austin deli for that perfect bite. My friend and I ordered a salad and sandwich to split.  The Bacon Alma sandwich which was a grilled combination of bacon, sliced apples, artistically topped with a spicy tahini and siracha sauce. The bacon and apples were such a great combination with the cheeses, and I loved that the sandwich had a sauce on top.  The Roasted Beet and Chickpea salad had cucumber, feta, and onions, and we opted for the Ararat's Pomsoy vinaigrette. The salty/sweetness of the vinaigrette was a nice combination with the roasted beets.  The portion sizes were hearty enough that splitting one was a meal in itself and they were nice enough to split the portions for us.  The service was fast and friendly, and they delivered our order to us out on the patio. They provide free wi-fi and offer a variety of other soups, sandwiches, salads and breakfast fare.  So if you find yourself on the Eastside and hungry, Hot Mamma's Cafe Current salad and sandwich menu Love the artistic detail with the spicy Tahini sauce and Sriracha heart on top my half of Bacon Alma sandwich I love that they split our Bacon Alma sandwich and roasted beet and chickpea salad for us.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in 2016 Yelp 100! I've actually never been to the restaurant itself. However Hot Mama's Cafe catered to our office for lunch and the food was great. The ingredients in the Egyptian Salad were super fresh. Not sure what makes it ""Egyptian"" though. There were two types of Hummus - Lemon Garlic which was new and interesting and Southwest which was closer to regular hummus but slightly different. The Pita Bread that came with it was as it should be.  I sampled two kinds of rice...I believe it said it was Long grain basmati rice seasoned with turmeric & another type of rice with butter. Both were delicious. I have no complaints.  As with the salad, the ingredients in the Roasted Vegetable Entree were first class! The Roasted Lamb was truly a delight. It was soft and tender without too much seasoning..in fact, nothing was overtly seasoned or greasy and it felt like I was eating good quality healthy food.  Based on this experience, I will certainly try out the storefront if I am ever in that area",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Cool little place. Great ambiance and music. Kinda like a hippie comune vibe... love it!  I had a Persian Prince (Avarat  at roasted lamb, Havarti, Avarat rosemary tahini and tomatoes) sandwich with chips and an amazing salsa. IT. WAS. EXCELLENT!  Washed it down with (brace yourself) a lavender lemonade... WHAAA? What kind of magic potion is this? I don't know but gimme more!  I'll be in frequently since I have a project nearby for the next year (YES!)",1
Coffee Shop 31,"So glad I stumbled upon this little gem on the east side! This selection was because of Yelp, so now I must return the favor and write my own review. The menu offers a variety of fresh and different dishes. I decided on the Mediterranean panini and a mixed iced tea drink (I forget the name! It included mint, apple juice & topo chico). After I ordered, I noticed a patio off to the side. A huge tree and hip decor, surrounded by metal benches and chairs. The customer service was awesome and I felt very welcomed. My food was brought out and it was DELICIOUS. Turkey, feta, tomatoes, onions, tapenade, then topped with dill mayo and cucumber...it came with chips and salsa which was also great. It was a satisfying weekday lunch and it didn't break the bank. I'm glad I found out about this hidden gem. I'll definitely be back to try more things off the menu Mediterranean Panini - DO IT",1
Coffee Shop 31,"FINALLY I have found a place for peace and quiet to enjoy some healthy food on my day off. No pretentious customers (stupid hipsters) or staff (same judgmental hipsters) condescendingly staring at you or berating you for not knowing what to order. And the best surprise it's in East Austin, hipster central.  I had just finished a run so I wanted something cool, breezy, but not too sweet. Iced coffee. Check. Not bitter, No added sweeteners. Refreshing and good.  I am fat and was definitely hungry. Bagelwich, Veggies were fresh. The everything bagel was delicious. Good texture, great flavor. However, the highlight was the veggie herd cream cheese. It brought everything together, jumped in my lap and slapped me in the face. Great food.  Service was fantastic. The person running the show that morning (sorry I never caught your name) was friendly and answered all my questions with the biggest smile. Bagelwich",1
Coffee Shop 31,I really liked this place. The grilled cheese was one of the best i ever had! Tge raspberry hot tea was very great. I did not love the cream soda. The peanut butter cookie was good! They need to put more parking lots around this area Grilled cheese,1
Coffee Shop 31,"Wow.  Lavender Lemonade! That just changed my life. Seriously. What an ADORABLE little venue, and the food is super affordable and delicious! Can't wait to go back! Highly suggest it!",1
Coffee Shop 31,3 check-ins I work close by and so this is our go-to work lunch place. Their paninis are pretty great. But the best part are their cookies! They have insanely delicious gluten-free and dairy-free cookie options!,1
Coffee Shop 31,"Such a cute little hidden gem in Austin, I love to bring first-timers and blow their minds by the food. Great prices for quality food and large portions which is kinda hard to find in Austin. I usually have the bacon alma until I realized you can get it into a salad form and fell in love. Overall go enjoy a lunch at Hot Mama's and you won't feel out of place with the great customer service! Bacon Alma",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Oh Hot Mama's - how do I love thee? Let me count the ways! The food here is exquisite: nourishing, healthy, freakin' delicious and made with so much love! I never get tired of eating here. Great environment and ambiance, super sweet staff, and a homemade chai that is just out of this world. Oh and - the cookies! So unbelievably tasty. Hot Mama's, you fill my heart and belly with joy! Thank you!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Updated review OK I have to re-write this because it isn't fair on the Hot Mama Team! This place is top notch, it has some of the most amazing food I have tasted in Austin. Including the homemade hummus (which nearly opens the heavens for the angels to sing) . Not only is the food fantastic but the service is just amazing. From the second we walked in we were made to feel like friends. And every time we go in we get the same reception.  Everything here is amazing BUT I want to highly recommend the following- Hot Mama Latte- Coconut vanilla coffee that isn't overly sweet but just so amazingly easy to drink. Persian Prince Panini- just try it. No words can describe it! Vanilla Coke- The team mix it themselves and it really is so bloody good!!  It is such good quality for your money. The prices are very reasonable and the food servings are huge!  Please go and get yourself a meal from a Hot Mama!",1

Coffee Shop 31,"Tried the lavender lemonade and fell in love! My kids say it tastes like lotion but I like it! I also tried the ""brownies""...that experience was a little different then I expected. I didn't know people like spicy brownies. It tasted like paprika or...ok, I'm not a chef so I wont guess anymore but I didn't like them. I am excited to try the other things on the menu however. Great service and if you dont mind sitting outside sometimes, a great atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 31,Best food on the east side.    Chicken pecan salad is in my top 3 salads in  Austin.    Muffins are amazing. Gluten free   Best in town.    Mama  is a sweetheart.,1
Coffee Shop 31,"4 check-ins Yum yum yum!!!  I had the Mediterranean mama sandwich: turkey, olives, feta, tomato, topped with dill mayo and cucumber.  It was so refreshing!  It comes with homemade salsa and some ""local chips"".  I also had a sunrise to drink (it was just plain delicious...unfortunately I can't remember what's in it).  Got out of there for a little more than $10.  Not bad!!!  I will for sure be back!  My friend had a La India sandwich: spiced chicken, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions topped with curry mayo and apples and she said it was equally amazing!

""Good morning papito."" I replied with a smile. ""I have to say that he said.  I have to call men pappas and women mamas, per the owner."" He explained with some apologetic embarrassment.  I ordered a double espresso and Roy ordered a Mexican coke.  Roy downed his in the small hippy digs.  We left refreshed.  Food.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Really great food and really great prices. To say that Hot Mama's feels authentic would be a drastic understatement. You would be hard pressed to find nicer people in the hospitality industry then the people who work at Hot Mama's. The food is great, the service is fast, and you will be sure to return for more.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Amazing place! Great hidden little coffee cafe on far E 6th! Great food, amazing coffee and staff that make you feel like it's your home. Truly a place that reminds me of the old Austin vibe that used to be everywhere!! Love you mamma!!!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"This place is Devine!   The seating is mostly outdoor in a quiet courtyard, with a huge oak tree.  There are some couches inside though. The staff was super friendly and funny, joking and laughing with us. I ordered the polenta, which is topped with melted havarti and sauted greens- chard with onion and garlic and carrots, and it came with soup or salad, I went with the salad, and toast with oil and spices...  The portion was a good size, and the food was perfect!! My husband got the lamb jammer I think it was called, and he said it was great too. Also their mocha was yummy!!' This is going to be a spot we hang out at a lot this summer when the weather's nice and we go to the city!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Hot Chocolate is amazing, and not on the menu.  The little calzone pastries were awesome.  Not a bad place to relax while waiting on your car to be repaired.    Sorry I am not a coffee guy so that is about as in depth as I can get.  I would go back for the pastries for sure.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Middle Eastern Eats (Austin) It seems that I'm always on the hunt for on-point and inspired Middle Eastern fare that doesn't come from a food truck here in Austin... somewhere casual but the kind of space in which I can sit for awhile and actually enjoy my meal.  At last, I've found it.  Within minutes of walking in, I decided that I'd soon be a regular at Hot Mama's. The space and the staff are totally inviting - even though I walked in right before close, they didn't attempt to make me feel guilty about placing a last-minute order. Instead, they invited me to take my time and chill. I decided to order a coffee as well, and took up residence on their outdoor patio. Life is good!  Then, life got even better. My Arawrap (Hot Mama's proprietary wrap creation) arrived and before I even tasted it, I could smell it: a grilled tortilla filled with tender slices of roasted New Zealand lamb, fresh tabouli and a sauce secretly spiced with what I believe to be turmeric. Somehow, it tasted delicately sweet yet the flavors still swung savory... a mystery that'll keep me coming back.  Looking forward to making this zen little cafe my new home away from home... office hours, anyone?",1
Coffee Shop 31,Listed in Running list of Favorite Coffee Shops Worldwide Very cool little spot off of 6th Street that you would not expect if I hadn't looked it up on Yelp. The people that work there seem like they enjoy their job and have fun. They're very helpful and provide useful suggestions. I didn't try any of the food but it sounded really good. My only complaint is that it would be nice if they had more seating. Great place. Oh and the coffee is very very strong! Which is good if thats what you like,1
Coffee Shop 31,I have to admit the cute gay guy with the skin tight pants is my reason for coming back. Giggidy! Food is bland sort of but then again I can't complain. I come here to try and eat healthy during lunch.,1
Coffee Shop 31,Great little Espresso Bar with even better paninis. The Bacon Alma panini is amazing! The patio,1
Coffee Shop 31,"Cute, quite, and yummy. Not a huge selection of food or places to sit down and eat but, the panini I ordered was quite tasty. Inside there are sofas and a coffee table and quiet little nooks to sit in. If you want to sit at an actual table you can sit outside. Luckily for me, it wasn't too hot to sit outside. The best part of the whole experience was sharing a lavender lemonade cookie at the end. Yummy Mediterranean panini",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Very nice people, and great food. Love the cookies (lavender and lemon cookies) - and they have a really tasty beet salad.  vegetable soup in the winter is also very tasty.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"In all of Austin, there are some great restaurants.  But the great restaurants focus on making mediocre food even better.  The difference at Hot Mama's is the *spices!*  Good Lawd, in all of Austin (and any locale I have been to for that matter) every body uses the same spices and they concentrate on preparing a better version of the meal.  Not so at Hot Mama's!!!!  Ubiquitously named a ""cafe',"" it's a not-well-known secret that you can get delicious, completely new types of food here that is simply off-the-hook!  Everything they make is unbelievably stellar.  I am part Middle Eastern myself and I know what good mediterranean food is.  The cuisine here is BETTER than that!  This review is based on at least 20 trips to this cafe.  My favorite is the regular Persian Ararat lamb sandwich/taco and the sometimes available special lamb/sweet potato/chick pea soup.  Because of the spices in that soup--best all time soup of my life.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I've been here twice, and both times was turned off by overly garlic-y food. I like garlic and love it roasted, but am not a huge fan when its raw. I had the veggie and feta panini. It had feta, potatoes, cauliflower, and about half a head of raw garlic inside. The bread was good, but the texture inside was mushy, and the flavors just didn't work together, even after I pulled most of the garlic out.   The next time I had the cheese sandwich and potato leek soup.  The sandwich was fine (but it's pretty hard to screw up grilled cheese).  The soup was so over spiced with raw garlic that I had to throw it out, which was disappointing since it was a cold day and I was really looking forward to something warm.   My coworkers love this place and swear the La India is the best thing to happen to sliced bread, but I am pretty over it.",0
Coffee Shop 31,"Good ambiance, friendly staff, lovely courtyard, severely disappointing food.  Here is what I had, and what the food actually tasted like.  Roasted Veggies & Feta Sandwich - ""Overcooked Boiled Broccoli and Carrots Smashed on Soggy White Bread""  3-Bean Veggie Soup Topped w/Chips & Salsa - ""Small Cup of Black Beans with No Toppings, No Seasoning, In Dire Need of Salt""  It's cold outside today, and my lunch was disappointing and expensive.  The woman next to me had the Roasted Beets & Chickpea salad and I had a serious case of food envy.",0
Coffee Shop 31,"Went for lunch on a Monday. Plenty of seating outside, mostly full inside. Got the veggie panini - quite tasty with a large portion of chips.

Coffee Shop 31,Great food. Excellent service. Awesome shaded outdoor patio. Kid and dog friendly. Bacon Alma panini FTW!,1
Coffee Shop 31,"I was just visiting town for the weekend. I'm from Manhattan, where there are more coffee stops than street corners. I wouldn't say I'm a coffee expert,  but I thought I knew enough to say which cups were good and which were just ""meh"". How wrong I was...  I stayed in a condo next door to Hot Mamas Cafe. Whenever I called for a cab, I would reference the pick up location as ""next to Hot Mamas Cafe"". This always resulted in confusion. Clearly no one knew this self-proclaimed Hot Mama. I disregarded her, deciding she must be a poser and assuredly not so Hot.  One day on my vacation, I was waiting longer than normal for a taxi. I NEEDED coffee. I supposed Hot Mamas would have to suffice. I was greeted by a friendly cashier and a warm atmosphere mixed with old, classic tunes. I got the iced coffee at the cashier's recommendation. It is the first cup of coffee I have ever concerned drinking black (and I'm usually the little-bit-of-coffee-with-my-cream-and-sugar guy).  Summary: Go here. Get iced coffee.  P.S. Their breakfast pastries are also amazing.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Hot Mama's catered a party last night for our organization. The food was delicious! The lamb was tender and juicy, the rice and curry was tasty, and the hummus was rich and flavorful. My favorite was the dessert, choklava! It was baklava filled with chocolate. The service was excellent. I highly recommend Hot Mama's to cater any event.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Love this place. I work nearby and this is always a consistently great lunch / beverage purchase. My personal favorites are the Bacon Alma panini and the Mexican Mocha.

I order the chai, no problem. My boyfriend orders a macchiato. The barista asks us ""what IS a macchiato?"" Almost condescendingly... if you've ever order the Starbucks Carmel Macchiato, this is quite different than the traditional macchiato, which is espresso served with a small amount of milk... I've been asked this question before at coffee shops- they just want to make sure you know what you're getting.  Ok, so we thought the barista was testing my boyfriend... NOPE. She honestly didn't know what it was or how to make it even though it was clearly on their menu. No one else was working and could make the drink - he ordered something else.  End of story -- how can you call yourself an espresso bar if you don't know how to make the basic drinks on the menu?",0

Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Coffee, the drug of choice Need some loving? This place dishes it out in savory mediterranean-hippy style with great service, delicious food/coffee and a cute space.  Hot Mama's may be an ideal community venue, as a little stage, ample patio space, and hula hoops adorn the cozy indoor shop. Local art hangs from the walls, kombucha is made in-house, and vegan/gluten-free options abound.  But then there is the menu of fantastic mediterranean sandwiches, salads and soup. The food is so good and popular that I saw quite a few people ordering for their offices. (nearby warehouses are home to freelance office spaces) I love the Persian Prince, with lamb, havarti, rosemary tahini and tomato. But I'm also a huge fan of the macaroons and muffins. Seriously, I don't think I could say enough about this place.  Saving the best for last, there was the service. These sweet and friendly baristas call regulars ""mama"" or ""papa"" and run around each other in a well choreographed dance. When my sandwich couldn't be made, I got a free cookie. And, incredibly, the customers know and interact with the baristas. Amazing.",1
Coffee Shop 31,Hot Mama's is a great little local coffee shop.  I originally went (and continue to return for!) their excellent coffee but soon found that they offer a lot more.

Coffee Shop 31,"I LOVE this spot! Amazing salads and sandwiches. The staff has always been extremely friendly. There is a wonderful patio with hula-hoops! Great place for lunch. Looks like a small coffee shop when you walk in but they have a pretty impressive menu.  There is almost no indoor seating and I've always had to sit outside, which is lovely but can get a little warm at noon.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Austin Times! My Hot Mama's experience is rather different because I this is where my dear friend and her new husband had their wedding dinner last month. The ceremony and dance party were held elsewhere, but this was our dinner stop.  We ate on the patio, which would've been more lovely had the weather been a bit warmer. Still, I see the draw completely. It's a bit shaded and private--very nice, just not when it's chilly and windy. The inside space is very clearly a small casual cafe, with naked ladies on the walls (it was sorta strange waiting in line with a 7-year old girl for the bathroom and hoping she wasn't paying attention to the artwork).  The food though. SERIOUSLY THE FOOD.  Roast lamb so tender you barely had to chew it... curry chicken... amazing sides and salads... stuffed grape leaves... couscous and rice... yum. So good. There were a ton of leftovers that they packed up nicely for my friend's parents and they brought some over to us the next day for dinner. Just as good the day after.  The staff had set up a huge buffet, which was kept up really well except (and with smiles) the whole time. The only issue was that there was no clear line or order of tables going up to the buffet so it took forever to get some food. I realize that might not really be their duty to manage the flow, but that was the only real room for improvement with the whole thing from a guest perspective.  Anyway, catering and events might not be their forte, but you'd never know it from the great food and service we had that night.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"We came pretty early and had an appointment to get to so we did not get a chance to sit or hang out on the patio area. We grabbed some breakfast treats and coffee. Nice ambiance, quick friendly service. The lady made suggestions when we could not make up our minds which was helpful. I definitely want to come back when I have more time and when there are more patrons. This seems like it would be great people watching spot.

From my very first Oatmeal Cranberry cookie to the last Bacon Alma Panini I had, Hot Mama's has been stellar.  I have a few favorites but they're such favorites I've been reluctant to try other things.  The La India Panini remains victorious.  Curried chicken with cheese and chopped apples complete with chips and delicious salsa.  I usually go for a Lavender Lemonade and I never regret that decision.  The staff deserve their own separate paragraph in this little review.  They are awesome.  Friendly, inviting and genuine - truly genuine.  They always have a moment to ask you how you're doing or check in on you.  The patio spins in its very own orbit.  It is bliss sitting outside with a book or some work (a little coworker and I are very guilty of taking half-days to sit outside and work at Hot Mama's).  Plenty of tables, a great, old tree to sit beneath and pleasing landscaping to make you feel as though you're not dining next to the road.  They definitely have this mama hooked.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I don't know what set Hot Mama's Cafe apart from all of the other hip/new-age cafes, the local Austin coffee shops that boast fantastically brewed beans that also happen to be local, and the abundance of gentrified East side establishments providing all who seek trendy grub and beverages with something fresh.  Alas, I dropped in early one morning to pick up a number of items to go, and I found that nearly everything was homemade. Where do they get their muffins from? They make them in-house--banana, blueberry, pomegranate appeared to be a unique combination. Were the pastries ready? Not quite; they were baking fresh! Alright; surely they utilize Counter Culture or Handsome for their beanage. No way; they use Kohana, a less common Austin roastery!  The quiche has a touch of ethnic flare to it, the crust being tossed around with curry powder, I believe. The basil, tomato, eggy goodness sat well tucked up in the nooks and crannies of the crumbly, but buttery dough. The breakfast pastry was empanada like, and the combination of tofu, potato, and the assorted veggie goodness was not bad; the crust was flaky and buttery, to boot.  They also do a fine job in cranking out some quality espresso, mine possessing a smooth smokiness without too much acidity and just the right amount of milky, weighted mouth feel.  The baklava is great. With an abundance of walnuts in the middle, the flaky piece of confectionery goodness is held together with the lightest smearing of extra sweet syrup. Dough is flaky; 'nuff said.  Hot Mama's offers up some fantastic handcrafted goodies, and the grub sits heavier than most coffee shop fare. That should sit well with you who want a bit more substance with your morning caffeine fix!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in My GoLocal card Where to go when I want to meet with a friend during rush hour on a Friday at a non-crowded place? Hot Mama's!  I walk up to this swanky strip center (I mean that in a nice way) and there are hula hoopers everywhere just frolicking around the patio showing off their mad skillz. I go inside, order an iced Mocha Mama Joy (and flash my GoLocal card!). The barista knew how to make this typically very sweet drink juuuuust right for my tastebuds.  My friend and I chose to sit outside on patio since the weather was so gorgeous, and it was so nice not to have to compete for a table.",1
Coffee Shop 31,I had the bacon alma and lavender lemonade and it was SO good! Would definitely have it again and again! The service was also quick and friendly!,1
Coffee Shop 31,Nice hidden gem of a place with a calming patio. Love to do yoga there saturday mornings 930. Tried the india chicken & vegitarian sandwich both good. Caramel latte was good as well.,1
Coffee Shop 31,"I went a few weeks ago.. love the laid back Austin Vibe :) I sat, read, listened to the nice water sound from the outside... the Persian Prince sandwich was amazing! I recommend it! I'll be back...",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I ordered the Roasted Veggies & Feta Panini and black coffee.  The panini was decent.  A little extra vinegar-y but all in all o.k. The chips were clean, thin, cut.  Not extra oily, stale or bland.  The salsa was mild but flavorful.  The black coffee was a medium Italian Roast not as caffeinated as I needed for this Monday but I ordered a 2nd cup and was pleased with the aroma and flavor.  My total was under $11 bucks! Pretty reasonable for a ""hipster"" cafe on the East side of Austin.  Panini was filling so I only ate 1/2 and took the rest to go.  The chick at the counter was sweet and had no problem explaining the selections to me in more detail. No attitude! Which is a PLUS especially coming from the North Bay Area (CA) where everyone is in a rush-always! My favorite part, the soulful music in the background! I heard: Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, Aretha Franklin and Bloodstone.  Definitely helped create a mellow environment to enjoy my early lunch.  Great ambiance.  Only bad thing was the people taking up whole couches on their laptops and one particular guy talking extra loud on his phone.  Do you really need that whole couch when you're not even eating anything? My friend and I had to sit about 6 ft apart and somewhat ""yell"" to converse.   So we just ended up texting each other during our meals.  Yes, I know, soooo Caiifornia! lol Roasted Veggies & Feta Panini Loved the soulful ambiance!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I want you all to know, before I even begin, that I am currently at Hot Mama's with a giant soy iced coffee, lamb and garlic lemon arawrap, and Greek salad in front of me. It's a beautiful 82 degrees out, my shoes are off, and I'm lounging on one of the ultra comfortable out door chairs under the shade of a large elm tree. I think it's pretty safe to say that this is one of the most perfect days, perfect moments, of my life. I also want you all to know that this experience was a complete accident. Riding around on bikes with my boyfriend, we decided we were hungry; our intention was to go to Bits and Druthers down the road. But me being the needy lady I am, decided I absolutely had to have some coffee before I fell off my bike in sheer exhaustion. Low and behold, some place called Hot Mama's coffee shows up around the bend and we decided to take a  quick pit stop to fulfill my java desires. Not only is this place a sweet little mediterranean heaven- the staff were sweet, suggestive, and awesome. My coffee- PERFECT. they brought us our food and the presentation was stunning. I should also explain that my man and I are both chef's, so we aren't the easiest to please. This food is off the freakin hook. Taking my first bites I felt like I was no longer in Austin, but some foreign country where food this good and unique is passed down from generation to generation and takes more than a kitchen aid, oven, and fancy cookware to make. The kind of food that stains your hands and fills the entire street up with spicy, delectable smells. As I'm writing this, I'm taking bites of this food and though it seems impossible- it just keeps getting better. Take my word for it- this is without a doubt one of Austin's best hidden gems. Check out the pictures I'm posting and see for yourself. I'm going to go back to my foodie bliss now.... Greek salad- YUM! Lemon garlic hummus and lamb arawrap Greek salad and two lamb and garlic lemon hummus arawraps. Holy crap good!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Popped into Hot Mama's this week for lunch ... What a great spot!  I had a mediterranean sandwich, and got to taste my friend's zucchini soup. Both were sooo good! They use amazingly fresh, local ingredients here, and it really shows! The salsa is loaded with veggies and yummy garlic, and packed with flavor. Coffee smelled delicious, but I didn't get to try it this visit.  Food and drinks are ordered at the counter, then they bring it to ya. Service is fast and friendly.  Inside lounge-y area is comfy and cozy, with a large, beautiful patio out the side entrance.  Great location on E 6th! Go check 'em out!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Work Time This is a great little cafe. I came here to work on a rainy day and ordered lunch and a chai latte. The main appeal of this place is the large patio area, but the couple of tables on the inside were pleasant as well.  There is a pretty large food menu, with sandwiches, hummus plates, salads, etc. The sandwiches come with chips and this roasted red pepper salsa that is absolutely to die for! I also had a delicious lemon scone made in-house.  I was there for a couple of hours working and regulars came and went, chatting with the owner, creating a real local feel to the place. They also have open mic nights, hula hooping hour, and other activities most weekends.  The only thing that makes this not ideal for hours of work is that the wifi was a little flaky and kept dropping off. So, if you have non-internet related work, it's a great place to be.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Great coffee, cozy atmosphere, excellent service!  Love the oatmeal cranberry cookies!!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"LOVE this place! Super friendly staff and lots of comfy places to work, read or just relax. We send a lot of our customers their way bc we love them so much!  Food is great! coffee is hot a delicious and lots of different choices....",1
Coffee Shop 31,rude counter attendant. Ice coffee tasted bitter. Looking forward to the coffee place opening just down the street.,0
Coffee Shop 31,"Wow, what a surprise!  After trying several coffee shops in Austin, I decided that the coffee scene here just wasn't 'there' yet.  I always get a non-fat latte to try to apples-to-apples compare and I have to say this is one of only two so far that my first reaction wasn't ....""ick.""  And the lady was soooooo friendly.  The space is small ish but has a wonderful outdoor patio that I would have loved if it weren't raining.  There are a couple of comfy looking couches inside too.    Please please come to the sunset valley area.  And please please stay open later.  I always love bringing a book to read after dinner to have a coffee and there just aren't too many places around here (that I like).",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Limited indoor seating, no bueno for the hot summer months.  Good coffee and rad music.    Be cautious of the baby table, it tips over easily.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I come here once a month for the Austin Sustainable Swap (that takes place in their patio area) and I never regret visiting this cafe. They have delicious food, and most importantly (to me), they have so many Italian flavors for sodas. They are friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"4 check-ins I love Hot Mama's! It is one of the few truly high quality cafes on East Austin. The staff are all lovely and kind, the coffee and the food are good, fresh and local. I also understand that they recycle, buy local and organic and pay their workers a living wage! Yay, Hot Mama's.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Great food and the customer service is super friendly. We even all sang a few songs together! Impromptu ""karaoke"". I had the Lemon/Lavender tea and cookie - was a perfect follow up to my lunch! I love the courtyard in the back I see hoopers there all the time. It's one of my favorite Austin cafes! The furniture and décor give an Alice in Wonderland feel - great job y'all!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Kelly from Hot Mamas catered our wedding this week. Her food was phenomenal! We had roasted lamb, a fruit couscous, basmati rice, southwest hummus, a vegan casserole and a yummy beverage station with lavender lemonade and hibiscus mint tea. The crew was professional and so nice. The food was ready on time and we had tons left over that they boxed up for us. I could eat that lamb every day of my life. So good! Also, Kelly was great to work with! She was willing to make alterations to the food for dietary requests and was on top of the details. They did a wonderful job on clean up too. Highly recommend this food, and their catering!!",1
Coffee Shop 31,Silly name but it's a really nice little cafe with solid Mediterranean-themed sandwiches and breakfast...empanadas? (Some kind of handheld savory pie.)  Not a ton of room inside but it has a nice outdoor patio with tables.,1
Coffee Shop 31,Great east-Austin place ... nice to have an option for Middle Eastern food in the midst of all the Mexican!  Hip and funky vibe (de rigeur for the eastside of today) with pleasant staff and atmosphere.  I tried the Persian Prince sandwich ... the lamb was excellent.  They also have a beautiful outdoor eating area ... definitely recommend.,1
Coffee Shop 31,"The coffee here used to be really good.  I don't know if they've changed their blend, but it now has a funny taste to it.  It almost tastes like what I imagine dirt would taste like.  I thought it was just a fluke the first time - like maybe I just got a cup that wasn't fresh.  But I went in again, and got a hot fresh cup with the same flavor.  This is the closest coffee shop to me, but I probably won't be going back for coffee any time soon.  I've had to throw both cups in the trash about 1/3 of the way through.",0
Coffee Shop 31,Updated review Props to the Owner Mama of Hot Mama's! She contacted me after my lacking experience the first time and invited me back to see that they really took my review to heart and valued my business and support.  It's a super casual place that has a awesome patio that we will frequent once it cools down. They also have a super friendly staff. But the real reason you go to a place is because things taste good and service is good right... OK I'll get to it then.  I had the Persian Lamb sandwich and Lavender Lemonade. Hubs had the Bacon Havarti. All were big winners but the Lamb sammie was sooo great. My hubs is from Iceland where lamb is serious business and I wasn't expecting awesome but it really was just that- completely awesome. Fresh tomato and a flavorful sauce was on top (be warned it is messy but worth a good stain or two). The Lemonade was very sweet but it was a great twist with the lavender and wasn't overdone (it could have tasted like soap but instead it was just super refreshing).  Well done Mama! Thanks for making me feel valued and for creating awesome food that will keep us coming back.,1
Coffee Shop 31,A very cool little place with a funky vibe. Some of the best coffee flavors anywhere....Kohana from Hawaii. Great quiche and the BEST salsa I've had in a long time.,1
Coffee Shop 31,"Super nice, friendly, and helpful staff. The food is amazing and resonably priced. The outside seating is AWESOME, but the inside seating is pretty sparse (just a few couches), but really I only ever go there to get something to go or to sit outside. Plenty of street parking and a really good overall ambiance to the place. It's one of my favorite east side coffeeshops.",1
Coffee Shop 31,2 check-ins I've been here before and it was really good but this time there was a bunch of people in line and only 1 person working so i just went elsewhere! but I'm still a fan Awesomeness on a pretty day,1
Coffee Shop 31,"I like this place.  I like it a lot.  And that's simply speaking to their coffee.  I have rehearsals near Hot Mama's and so whenever I give myself enough time, I'll always drop in for an Americano right before.  Why is that?  Why not head to the more convenient coffee shops closer to the highway?  Well, because this just might be the best Americano I've come across.  Hot Mama's is truly one of the better coffee shops in Austin.  And it's actually for their coffee.  Now why don't I love the place?  The problem is I've never spent much time there--usually grabbing my drinks to go.  But the eclectic inside is very lovely and from what I've seen the much larger outside looks like a great place to work or relax on a nice day, so I'll definitely be making a day trip in the near future to get the full Hot Mama's experience.  And I have a feeling when I do, this place will go from a like to a love in a hot second.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Just went here for the first time, and was very happy!  I had the lamb, which was delicious. The outdoor patio was nice and spacious.  They are also an espresso bar, which is great since I just moved into the area, and was looking for a place to get my morning coffee.  I will be back for sure and look forward to trying everything on the menu.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Austin Coffee Shops It's as cozy as it is tiny: this diminutive coffee spot on East 6th was my camp out spot for a meeting this week, and I came away pleased. Staff was friendly and eager, and seemed to be genuinely having fun. In this day of semi-aloof baristas, I'll take some shiny and happy, thanks.  I rounded out my italian soda with a baklava (they have a $4 rule if you user your debit card), and was glad I did. That dessert was nearly as sweet as the staff, and my guess is that the rumor of the new owner re-claiming the business from the previously owned folks is a welcome one. They're re-opening house is this weekend, and that it'll be packed isn't much of a surprise, as the place is teeny tiny. But perhaps a pleased grin will be.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"This is one of my favorite places for coffee - I enjoy getting their toddy (cold-pressed ice coffee), and the oat toffee crunch cookies (HUGE, $3) are super delicious.  I've only had a few of their menu items, like the veggie bagel and the hummus plate, but I've enjoyed them - and my mother loved the quiche.  I always appreciate the mostly friendly staff - I expect(and appreciate) being pulled out of my grump whenever I come here!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Great place to get your caffeine fix, grab a bite, and do a little work. I'd recommend the iced coffee (delicious and not at all bitter) and the bagelwich (bagel with cream cheese, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers). If I lived on the east side, I'd be a regular at this place.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"A fantastic, delicious little Mediterranean place! Had the Persian Prince and it was fabulous! A marvelous Austin treasure!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Super funky cafe with the front girl being equally matching the place. I had some yummy drink, bagel with hot mama cream cheese and chocolate baklava that was super good and crunchy. Outside patio is a plus.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Freakin love this place! Amazing food, amazing people.... truly one of the many reasons Austin is so great.  Whether you want a brilliant lunch, a unique and tastey coffee drink or just need to get a soul-recharge from some amazing staff people... You HAVE to try this place.  I live in North Austin... a good 20 minutes away ... and gladly make the drive to see them whenever I can.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I expected more Mediterranean food. Ordered an awawrap and lavender lemonade. The woman at the register was not rude, but far from friendly. My lavender lemonade seemed watered down. My wrap was hot on the outside and cold on the inside. The chips on the plate for the chips and salsa side were nothing but crumbles from the bottom of the bag. The only real positive thing I have to say is I loved the salsa. This place has lots of potential, but I really feel they dropped the ball with me. I doubt I'll ever come back.",0
Coffee Shop 31,"What a great patio! I went to a hooping event today. I only had the lavender lemonade but that was really good. Served in a large glass with lots of ice, it was just the ticket for my frequent hooping breaks. The patio has raised platforms here and there that were perfect for our hooping selves.  I will go back to sample the food as well. The barista/owner was very welcoming. I think that says a lot for a place. The inside looked comfy-cozy but we were out on the patio. Something about large hoops twirling all over the place...",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Cool art, refreshing and eclectic cold drinks, good coffee. I love the curry grilled chicken salad, though I am going out of my way to try other menu items. My only disappointment is that I don't get to go by my friendly neighborhood eatery often enough.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Not only is this a great local cafe, but they hold lots of fun events such as belly dancing and hoop dance parties on their back patio.  The food here is very good and mostly healthy.  Gotta try the homemade kombucha when you are here.  It's delish!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I must have missed the outdoor patio everytime I drove by because I had no idea there was one. The main reason I go to coffee shops is just to get out of the apt or to read a book in good weather, so one of the main criteria I judge coffee shops by is their outdoor seating. Furthermore, the difference between a good and great coffee shop is the comfort of their furniture. More shops should realize that splurging on decent furniture is a very wise investment (lookin' at you Caffe Medici). I was pleasantly surprised by Mama's patio chairs. Chic AND comfortable. A+ I went to try their coffee but was swayed by the tea. They have a small but eclectic collection of drinks - mate, Mexican mocha, lots of teas, hot & cold, and some interesting-looking beers I've never heard of.  As others have pointed out, this area of E 6th is quickly turning into an alley of high-priced condos. I'm calling it the Yuppie Corridor - between about Chicon & Pedernales. The area is odd because it seems so isolated and desolate. There's really not many people around - at least not when I've been down here. I assume most of these condos are still waiting to be filled. I'd seen Hot Mama's before, riding my bike down this way, but the strip mall atmosphere was a put off. From the street it looks like just another average coffee shop. But I decided to try the place solely based on other reviews.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I feel like this place will become a new obsession of mine. I work out down the street at eastside Austin elite, I was absolutely starving after class and randomly pulled over at the first thing I saw. Everything in their menu sounds divine. I went with the bacon apple alma (not sure of real name) it was just incredible!!! I can't wait to try all of their sandwiches. Plus the interior is so stinking cute, kind of like you are home, comfy and cozy!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"An instant deal on Living Social clued me into this coffee shop/ eatery. They have house-made kombucha (I tried the lemon/ lavender) ($3) and rotating specials. I tried the green goddess taco special with soup ($8). The tacos consisted of chickpeas, feta, greens, and basil hummus on corn tortillas, and the soup was a lamb and collard green concoction. I wish the girl at the counter would have told me how similar they were in ingredients but I am glad I tried both, so no big deal. I will definitely be back!",1
Coffee Shop 31,Delightful (and highly caffeinated) staff & equally delightful outdoor patio.,1
Coffee Shop 31,"Nice new coffee place in what will soon become condo canyon in East 6th Street.  Hot Mama's has more character than you'd expect from its location. The indoor part is quite small - maybe only 6 cafe-type round tables for two.  But don't sit inside - enjoy the huge outdoor courtyard (with a great shade tree) all done up in industrial sheet metal theme - really cool and chic.  Don't forget to look up to see two of the biggest suspended light fixtures you've ever seen.  Sitting in this courtyard with an espresso and frowning as you text on your iPhone will up your hip-o-meter by 6 points, minimum.  The cappuccinos are lovely, and mine came with an exceptionally stiff foam top, just how I like it.  I didn't get any food, but I was impressed by the menu of real food offerings - panninis, salads, and so on, with an emphasis on middle eastern dishes (baba, hummus, etc.) Someone got a Greek salad at a table next to me - looked fresh and big.  One thing that caught my eye that I will try out next time is the ham & muenster croissant dusted with powdered sugar.  Free wifi is available, although you have to go through the hassle of creating an account (password, username, etc) --  totally stupid for a one-time event, but whatever. Just make it free and unlocked - what's the big deal?  Barista was really friendly, but as he was a he, I assume he wasn't the eponymous hot mama.  So who is?",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I stopped in here today for a quick meeting and this place was empty. A bit of a shame. There is a pretty decent menu with good prices and good coffee drinks. There is a large patio outside as well as seating for about 20-25 inside. Staff was friendly and this cafe was clean. I know they have Wi-Fi here, but not a single customer was using it...a bit refreshing for the freeloaders that sit in cafe's for six hours and have a $2.00 cup of coffee.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Gluttony or Sloth?, I want to go to there., Restaurants for the Underemployed, I'll sleep when I'm dead. I am loving Hot Mama's. Free wireless, nice patio. Today the barista (I'm so sorry I didn't get his name, he rocks) made me a honey nut latte - so good. Not too sweet, smooth espresso, and while I was there he whipped up a batch of blueberry banana muffins from scratch. I totally wanted more than one, and I got the first one hot out of the oven. It was heavenly. Hot Mama's goes on my short short list of cafes to hang out, read, and work at.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Visiting from NY, I was excited to check out this cafe which advertised a free movie showing of the Marx Bros. at 7:30pm tonight (supposedly every Monday they have this). I waited for an hour (from 7-8pm), no movie! And worse yet, no explanation or apology!  Too bad. The Lavendar Lemonade was tasty, however.  But the fact the location is not near any public transportation (due to construction on a major bus route and I don't drive), and that an event did not happen as advertised on Austin's major alternative weekly ""The Chronicle"" bummed me out a bit.",0

Coffee Shop 31,"Listed in Best Restaurants Great food. Decent prices. Awesome ambiance. Even in the atx heat, lunch on the patio/garden was great. Just some annoying flies but thats anywhere. Had a great salad and italian soda. Salad was bigger than it looks and so good I didn't even use the dressing. I will be back.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"I love this place.  The food is good, the coffee and drinks are good, and they make their own kombucha, which is also good.  But more than all of that, the staff is all very genuinely nice and inviting.  From the first time I visited this establishment, I felt welcomed, and I knew I had found my neighborhood spot.  Now I'm there at least once a week.  It never ceases to amaze me how far a smile and a little kindness can go.  Even if you live across town, if you're having a bad day, drive over to Hot Mama's, get a Hot Mama Latte (it's ridiculously delicious), and relax for a few minutes.  I promise you'll feel better when you leave.",1
Coffee Shop 31,"As you drive Easterly to  the point where you have validated the curvature of the planet, you will arrive at an area that will remind you of: Dallas.  I suggest that you bypass the cramped inside with complete strangers staring at you as an intruder, quickly order, and go outside to the patio.  Oh, what is this land?  I like it!  I have forgotten the drive, the claustrophobia.   I love the  core-tin steel booths and tables, the trees, the fountain, and the quiet.  When someone can meld the funk with the ultra-modern,  you get ""pastoral-urbanity"" as I just named it.   And I love it!",1
Coffee Shop 31,"Decent food but nothing to write home about, nice patio. Incompetent waiter (""I didn't have time to put cream cheese on your bagel"" and he said he'd use 2% milk but later I was told by another waiter it was whole milk) and grindy, stress inducing music.",0
Coffee Shop 69,"I love this place for its affordable prices, reliable customer service, cute presentation and quality tea. I frequent it quite often due to my anglophile tendencies -- I took a semester Abroad in England. I am always on the look out for the best tea, scones, and clotted cream. The scones here great! The currant sells out often. I can recommend the cranberry scone and the rosemary/cheddar scone. It's moist yet flakey.  The tea selection here is extensive and it really depends on your taste. My only complaint about this place is---I believe that clotted cream should really be served at room temperature. They serve it cold here and its incredibly hard to spread without breaking the scone.  There tea sandwiches are awesome and you can do it with crust off! There's free wifi ---but you are only allowed to stay for 2 hours.  Pro Tip: They also have a location at the Domain --- that sometimes is less busy.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"It saddens me to give this place a 2-star review. I usually love the Steeping Room for their great tea selection and healthier menu options but our last visit during the Sunday Brunch time period was not good. Biggest issues we had: slow service & awful tough ciabatta bread.  We were immediately seated but then service during the entire meal was really slow. In fact, every time we go service is slow and poor. We ordered our tea first and it took a good 10-15 minutes to arrive. In the meantime, we ordered scones and our main meals. They brought the scones at the same time as the meal though which was frustrating as we would have liked to enjoy them with our tea before the main meal.  On top of the slow service, the meals we had were very difficult to eat. I ordered a chicken bahn mi sandwich. While the flavors were fine, they serve the sandwich in what I can only describe as a huge ciabatta boat. It's impossible to actually eat like a sandwich. It's impossible to cut through with a knife. I had to ask the waiter to bring me a plain slice of bread so I could actually enjoy the chicken and other elements of the sandwich like a sandwich. My husband ordered the Take the Bate sandwich and we had the same issue. Impossible to eat/cut.  Pros of the meal: the teas were great, scones were great (currant scone + clotted cream is delish!), and when we did complain to our waiter, the manager came by and apologized, offering to comp our team on the ticket.  In the past, I've had better experience with the normal main menu. The Buddha Bowl is truly one of my favorite meals. The peanut sauce they use is so so good. But after our last experience, it'll be a while before we are back. Would rather go to True Food Kitchen to get a better meal and better service.",0
Coffee Shop 69,"Nice place , ??? Very disappointed with the hostess letting me know ""She can't accommodate our party of 8.. Didn't offer splitting parties or any options other than I CAN NOT HELP YOU AND FEEL FREE TO COME BACK ANOTHER TIME.... NO THANK YOU...learn some customer service",0
Coffee Shop 69,"Tried this place for Sunday brunch.  One of the few places in the area that didn't have a wait.  Extensive gf offerings, sweet and savory.  Had the Monte Cristo on gf rice bread and a carrot cupcake for dessert.  Everything was delish and service was fast and attentive. The sandwich was stuffed with turkey, ham and cheese.  We added a fried egg and bacon. It was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The carrot cake was super moist and not too sweet.  My husband didn't even know that it was gf.  Would def come back and try other things.  The only downside was they didn't have a liquor license so no mimosas, which is a must have for brunch (in my opinion). Gf Carrot Cupcake GF Monte Cristo with fried egg",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I've been here 4 times and I've been very happy.  Excellent service and tea, clean bathrooms, solid biscuits and additions.  The only negatives are that they tend to pack you in tight and it's a little on the expensive side, but nothing too intense.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Finally got to try this place after passing it on my dog walk everyday, and it did not disappoint! I got the Bangkok bowl with chicken and eggplant over brown rice, it was absolutely delicious! They have a great selection of tea, I'm looking forward to trying more dishes and tea!",1
Coffee Shop 69,This is one of my favorite places in Austin. My guy and I come here about once a month for a date lunch. It's lovely. I love the friendly staff and all the goodies.  My only complaint is I wish there was more private booths for seating. It's hard to have a conversation with everyone else talking so close to you.,1
Coffee Shop 69,"Lunch: Jasmine Gravlax with a side of Cashew Salad. So delicious!  This place is so cute, you just want to relax and drink tea and eat tea sandwiches all day!

I asked for the eggs to be a soft scrambled, and much to my surprise, they added a nice slab of melty cheese on it. Nice touch.  The soysage did not taste like ""fake meat"" at all. Y'know, the chemical kinda taste? And the scone was small but delish. We were seated promptly (oddly enough, the hostess stand was right at the middle of the restaurant) and service was great. They have a shelf full of a plethora of teas and tea gadgets. Neat place! Cheddar scone, soft scrambled eggs and veggie soysage. Nom nom!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Very good tea spot in Austin. I love that they first give you the clear option of lounge seating or full-service without any sort of confusion. The decor is also quite nice - modern, but warm and charming. Lots of natural lighting.  We chose the full service and ordered the Century Oaks Tea Service, which is sort of a full-English tea service - comes with a pot of tea, a scone, tea cookies, a slice of tea cake, and two tea sandwiches,. In terms of tea selection, there is a *TON* of high-quality choices. We got a reserve black tea, which turned out to be quite nice (smooth and balanced, with a more adventurous, grassy finish). The food accompaniments were also all top-notch. The tea cookies were tiny little sweet treats that were perfectly-sized considering their sweetness. The scone was a cheddar-rosemary scone, and it came with clotted cream and raspberry jam; this was truly the star of the tea service. I loved the scone's savory flavor with the not-to-sweet jam and the richness of the clotted cream; excellent combination. The tea cake was an orange tea cake with this candied orange icing; while the cake itself was moist and flavorful, we did feel that the icing was far too sweet. Finally, we got the lemon scallion and romesco sandwiches; both went perfectly well with the entire tea service.  All in all, a delightful experience. They seem to have a great selection of food and teas. Highly recommend this place for lunch or late afternoon treat! Tofu Napa Rolls Century Oaks Tea Service Page 1 of the insanely long tea menu!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"At the Domain to meet a friend who had an appointment at the Apple Store.  Advisor there recommended The Steeping Room so we gave it a try.  Not our best decision of the day..  Walked in and ordered drinks.  Guy never asked if we were staying or going, but after paying and asking if we could sit anywhere he informed us the inside was table service and he forgot to tell us that.  If we had known we would have gotten a table and been waited on.  Next, there was only one couple waiting ahead of us for drinks and we still waited over 10 min for a plain coffee and chai.    Finally got our drinks and my coffee was cold.  My friends chai was nothing special and a bit watery.  We went outside and sat down since it was chilly and no one was being served by a waiter.  After a few dirty looks from a server, we moved on.    Maybe it's just the area, but found the whole thing lackluster and not worth the time or money.",0
Coffee Shop 69,"Listed in Vegan in Austin Vacation One thing I love about Austin is the friendly people. The friendliness of the servers at The Steeping Room definitely stood out!  Not only was the service excellent, but the food and tea were also very delicious.  It was a memorable experience and I'm glad we got the chance to try it out before heading back to Cali.  Luckily a couple of my friends in my group were tea connoisseurs so I let them choose the teas.  My friend selected the Yame Gyokuro green tea and also the ""Milk"" Oolong.  Both teas smelled heavenly and I really enjoyed the feeling of awareness I felt when sipped on them.  I even brought some of lovely Yame Gyokuro home with me.  As far as food, we decided to share everything.  I love sharing with friends so we can try several dishes.  Below is what we ordered: - Zen Tea Service - napa rolls with tofu/ walnut cucumber, edamame, matcha dusted vegan chocolate cupcake (subbed a vegan cupcake with the brownie).  Loved the fresh rolls and the cupcake was to die for! - Moroccan Spiced Carrot Hummus Tea Sandwich with shaved fennel and scallion with Tao of Green Salad - this was delicious.  Enjoyed the hummus! - Vegan BAT - tempeh bacon, arugula and tomato with basil veganaise with cashew caesar.  This was super tasty with locally made tempeh.  I loved it all and the cashew caesar was so good! - Buddha Bowl - grain of the day (rice), beans, sauteed greens, sweet potato medallions, with added tempeh.  We selected the peanut sauce and sesame tamari vinaigrette.  Healthy and delicious!  I highly recommend The Steeping Room and will be sure to come back the next time I'm in Austin.

Coffee Shop 69,"A good bunch spot! Ordered a Croque Monsieur sandwich from our waiter's recommendation, and it was unlike anything I've had before. It was some kind of ham and cheese with tomatoes on top, which sounds kind of plain but honestly the flavors were so much more intense than just that. I highly recommend it. I even called the waiter back over to ask him how these simple ingredients could taste like THAT.  Also shared some scones with clotted cream and Ceylon (Sri Lankan) tea with a friend. Loved that tea... I've been thinking about it ever since. Will definitely come back for some more tea and that crazy good sandwich art piece :) Croque Monsieur sandwich comes with salad with specialty dressing (the dressing is crazy good)",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I've been to this location twice, and both experiences were great. I'm gluten and dairy free, so eating out is usually difficult. Almost everything on the menu can be make gluten free friendly. Their selection of teas is also great. Olivia was my server the other day, and she was wonderful! So friendly and provided great service. So happy to have found a GF friendly place. The GF carrot cupcake was delicious! Even for those who aren't GF. Definitely will be back soon.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I give this location two stars because of a recent encounter with a women behind the counter.  I know it sounds a bit harsh, but this was not the first time this type of situation has happened to me.  The woman behind the counter rang up my order wrong. I calmly commented that wasn't what I ordered and she immediately acted defensive and rudely blamed me for getting my order wrong.  Then acted annoyed when she had to fix the transaction.  Seriously?  I even offered to pay the 2 dollar difference in cash.  Luckily, the manager overheard the situation and he quickly took control.  He was amazing, kind and apologetic.  I hesitated to write this review, but this same thing (rudeness at the counter) has happened to me several times.  For that reason, I think I might be taking a long break from Steeping Room.    I will say the food is great (a little pricey for what it is), the manager is awesome, and the severs are great if you sit to enjoy your meal at the restaurant.  Overall, it's great as long as you don't get the defensive woman at the front counter.",0
Coffee Shop 69,"N Lamar location  Atmosphere (2/5): I had a reservation for 3 for Sunday noontime, and it was very crowded and loud. By the time I left around 1:30PM, there was still a line waiting to be seated. Booths (for parties of 3+) are nice, but if you are a party of 2, I think the tables are way too small and way close to each other. This place may be a suitable non-romantic non-imposing place to take a first date, but that's only true if you don't mind other parties seated within arm's reach.  Tea 1 (1*): At my server's recommendation, I ordered a Kenyan black tea ($4.95/jug) whose description said it has strong chocolate flavor. However, my black tea had no such flavor, or any flavor at all. It also lacked a scent. In hindsight, I should have asked if they had given me the wrong order by mistake.  Tea 2 (2*): My friend ordered tea service ($10-11) which included a jug of a flowery/fruity tea that had nice strong scents, but again lacked flavor; and 2 scones, which were small muffin-shaped and pretty good (although, they are severely overpriced at what equates to ~$2.50-$3 each).  Our server was very nice and tried to be helpful in picking out tea and snacks, but I think the tea we ordered were not worth it at all. The atmosphere is also too hectic for me. Not a very relaxing place to have tea, but they do have a decent sized selection of different kinds of tea.  A single tea service (1 jug is more than enough for 2 people, with 2 scones) is enough for two people who are not hungry, but if you are, there are also meal foods.",0
Coffee Shop 69,Updated review Today the strada was a nasty soggy mess :( looked flavorful. I wanted to take it back and sadly I felt like I had to answer 100 questions ;( poor Saturday lunch not fun,0
Coffee Shop 69,"This place is heaven.  I'm no longer vegan (I know... my veganism didn't last long...) so I went to town on my visit to The Steeping Room.  They have fantastic scones! My boyfriend, who is Scottish, loves the ""proper"" British-style scones served here. They're crumbly, moist, and not sweet at all---which is a GOOD thing! They are perfect to top with clotted cream and jam!  For my entree, I ordered their strata with a greens salad. The strata tasted so good it made me want to find a recipe to make one at home! It had just the right amount of cheese, which had caramelized across the top of the egg dish, and the vegetables inside were fresh.  I also ordered a chai tea with almond milk. Everything here is delicious.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Definitely one of my favorite places! The Buddah Bowl is my favorite! If you like to eat healthy, this is the place for sure!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"So my best friend and I mused about how this place ended up next to a large chain coffee shop. After tasting the tea I would be worried if I was the other store. I loved the tea. We took it to go and strolled through the mall with the kids. Nice selection of tea and desserts to go. They even have lavender cake, a true favorite. Same complaint as with the other places we visited. The malls signage really sucks. We found this place while driving around looking for another store. I'm glad I didn't miss it.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Came here for a mini birthday gathering and the service was incredible. We came pretty late and stayed almost an hour past closing time (lost track of time), and we're not rushed to get out.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Went here with a friend for afternoon tea. Service was efficient and friendly, tea and food was delicious (I especially liked the gravlax).  Definitely worth visiting.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"So Tea is a thing. Not exactly my thing, but I am going to display my objectivity in this review. The Steeping Room is a bit unique. Tea, otherwise, is such an antiquated meal and tradition. And ""High Tea""? Forget about it. I would never get that high. I have an Aunt in London who wanted to show off the British Tea experience. She recommended we all dress up in top hats and morning jackets and spend 100 pounds per person to do it. Talk about a pretentious scone. I am surprised it would even deign to have itself lathered up in clotted cream.  Anyway, this is not the Steeping Room. The Steeping Room is the Austin version of the same. Casual, yet not cheap. You can expect to spend $20pp for your tea service of which there are several varieties. And if you wish to go a-la-carte, there is a decent selection of items from which to construct a small-mid sized meal.  The food gets as dietary conscience as you like. Are you gluten free? They got that covered. Are you on an auto-immune protocol diet? Check! Vegan candida cleansing? They got your back! So, flexibility is the name of the game. And the execution is good. Flavors combine in a very favorable way at the Steeping Room.  On to the teas. The selection is well thought through.  And the staff? Totally friendly and helpful. It is a godsend for the clean eating set. And I dare say old chap, it even works decently well for someone who doesn't give a damn about what they but in their bodies.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Amazing food for vegans, vegetarians, and gluten-free humans. Super kind staff. The only issue the day my friends and I came was that it was a busy time and we over stayed out welcome. They asked us politely to leave, but still left a bad taste in my mouth. Tea Plate for Brunch",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I'm not sure what happened here! My hubs and I wanted to try out this location since I love the one in the Domain. The service was super slow and awkward and the food was very bland. This place is nice if you want a cup of hot tea I guess, but the food is definitely overpriced for what it is. There are just too many other great options in Austin that are more flavorful and give you more bang for your buck!",0
Coffee Shop 69,I love this place! It's great if you are alone or with a friend. So many wonderful teas to choose from. The food is also fantastic! I love getting the tea service because you get to try the sweet and savory of this place with a pot of tea.,1
Coffee Shop 69,"Food is good but the place is noisy and the service is pretty inattentive. When I asked for a quieter table, the hostess kind of sneered at me. Eh - not worth it. So many other great places to go",0
Coffee Shop 69,"I've often seen this restaurant as I work directly across the street. I erroneously assumed it simply served tea and pastries, and had never imagined the extensive brunch/lunch items available.  For those seeking clean eating, gluten free, vegan options, this place is for you. For those who could care less, the food is good quality and tasty. I love, love, love that the basic salad offered has a lot of red and leafy green lettuce. Their balsamic has a nutty base (cashew I think) and not too tangy.  I was immensely impressed that despite how busy they were, there was a server who greeted me not long after I entered the door and explained the process (how to order if to-go or dining in. This was especially important as I entered through the street entrance which is furthest from the counter/hostess station.  I felt very comfortable to sit and peruse the menu and order in the time I needed. The cashier was also immensely friendly and helpful.  Plus, the food was delish, and they included a checklist showing that my order was checked before sent out.  It is more than most lunches, but the quality of food certainly meets the expectation of the cost. If you care more for high quantity/low cost, skip. But if you are looking for a healthy, good quality meal with great service, check out the Steeping Room!",1
Coffee Shop 69,The service and food here is great. There is an overwhelming amount of tea to choose from but my cousin and I went for the white oolong which was delicious. I also had the granola and yogurt for breakfast which was refreshing. I would return to this place anytime! Tea set when you order a pot Granola and yogurt,1
Coffee Shop 69,"This is my experience at this establishment: went there with my wife and, in accordance with their policy, our dog.  We sat not far from the door, and one of the waiters slammed (unintentionally of course) the heavy metal door on our pooch's tail. It cut, and we took him to the hospital.  The tail was so damaged that it had to be amputated, resulting in a $1,000 bill for breakfast. We contacted the owner, who flatly refused to consider reimbursing us, put us in contact with their insurance company who also turned us down like you know it never happened.  The owner was polite, cold and aloof and basically said the incident was our fault. Their waiter, their door, our fault. In a city that is as dog friendly as Austin I would not recommend this establishment to dog owners at all.  The food was OK, you will understand we were left with a bitter taste in our mouth.",0
Coffee Shop 69,"6 check-ins I love, love, love The Steeping Room. It's become my go-to for a quick, light dinner before going to art class. Grab a nice pot of tea or a tisane if I'm not wanting caffeine. The food is always great. The exact things you want to eat with tea. I recently had the tea service that came with napa rolls, edamame, and a macha-dusted brownie. Holy cow! The rolls were huge, edamame tasty and I ended up taking home the brownie and making my husband's night.  I ALWAYS get a ginger scone (if I don't have dessert) with clotted cream. PERFECTION!  The people who work here are great and very helpful. Always get a smiling face when I come in and terrific service. This is a perfect spot for ladies to lunch together, a group to enjoy a nice tea service or even someone wanting a little alone time with a relaxing cuppa.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"We went to steeping room this morning for breakfast and it was a bad experience. The tea took 10 mins and the ticket time on the entrees was about 25 mins. The manager had excuses on the ready, specifically that the food is hand crafted. I had a Monte Cristo, which is literally bread, Turkey, ham, and cheese. Not exactly an elaborate, hand crafted dish. The icing on the cake was the fruit being half pineapple, which I wasn't told was in the fruit side, and I can't eat. I definitely recommend eating breakfast elsewhere!",0
Coffee Shop 69,"Updated review I have to downgrade my review. Last time I was here at this N. Lamar location was well over two years ago. Since then the food quality has dropped drastically. It's shit served as ""healthy alternative"" food.  I was with a colleague and we both ordered finger sandwiches.  First off I had the $7.95 white bread cucumber and cream cheese. They didn't even cut the bread right. It wasn't against the grain of the crust and it was a sloppy job. The sandwiches come with a choice of salad or chips. I chose salad. First thing I noticed was the rancid smell of the vinegar. Definitely not balsamic of Modena, a poor alternative, cheap shot. Then the salad! It was straight out of a Costco sou vide bag and days old. The lettuce was wilting and sticky and brown in many places. Yuck.  I returned it asking for a replacement. I got a very nice watermelon tomato gazpacho. BUT wait, here's the clincher, they didn't replace it. They charged for the measly $2.00 extra for the soup. Cheapskates.  The service sucked. It was so quick I thought I was at a Japanese conveyor belt sushi place. Before I had a chance to study the menu she crept up behind me asking if I was ready to order.  I couldn't finish one thing before the overzealous waitress was down my throat asking if it was okay.  I will not be back!",0
Coffee Shop 69,"Thoughtful, conscientious, and delicious food.  The tea concept is excellent, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.  The Steeping Room offers an intelligent menu that's hard to find, blending a unique combination of healthy and fresh food.  Highly recommend this place for anyone seeking to go beyond BBQ and the run-of-the-mill American ""cuisine"" (i.e. SAD).",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I love tea. I love tea, a lot. Especially loose leaf. Ever since I got turned on to loose leaf tea by the internetz, I have a hard time with bagged, corporate bullshit (I'm fighting the man!). Ok, I'm not a hipster, I still drink bagged tea, but I do love my little leafy leaves.  Done being weird, back to the review.  This place is awesome. Especially when you have a full pot of white magic (er ... ), jazz music piping over the speakers, and a fantastic friend to share it all with. The service is stellar and prompt and the atmosphere is inviting. I want to try literally every tea there. Every. Single. Fucking. Tea.",1
Coffee Shop 69,OMG! Try the Chai Spiced French Toast!!!!! I got it with the gluten-free rice bread. I had my reservations about the bread because I'm not the type to eat at places that are vegan or gluten-free but it was AMAZING!!!! I especially loved that it was served with fresh fruit. So good!,1
Coffee Shop 69,"Very good place. Relaxed vibe. Casual. Busy at lunch, but not too busy at dinner time. Food is good; not amazing, but good. Tons of tea options. I once ordered a Bahn Mi sandwich on which the pork was less well cooked than I like it (but totally safe to eat). The manager took the Bahn Mi off of my bill even though it was not the kitchen's fault. Great customer service in that case.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"8 check-ins Listed in The Amy D List - ""Royalty"", The Ashley S List - ""Delightful"", The Alison L List - ""Amazing"", The Same Places Ain't Always Alike..., The Jenny L List - ""Until Yelp Do Us Part"" It occurs to me among Alison L, Ashley S, Amy D, and Jenny L - the four Yelpers I've name-dropped so often I've had to make their own lists - the only restaurant experience we actually share in common is the Steeping Room. I'm pretty sure that's significant in some way. Incidentally, I'm as significant to those four ladies as much as their dry cleaner, or maybe a good HEB cashier. But we've had some fun times together at various Yelp events.    What makes the Steeping Room unique is how it evokes the Rashomon effect, because it appears to represent different things to different people. I used to think it was our local vestige of Dallas, the upscale alternative to the usual coffeehouse suspects. But now I'm starting to think it may be the most underrated vegan & vegetarian place in town - you really can vegetize any menu item here and eat meatless pretty well.  From their lunchtime BLT's substituted with tofu & tempeh, to a delightful tea service with scones & cakes & jams I randomly shared one morning, I've always had a fun time at the Steeping Room. And always make resos for lunch - Prada to the left of me & flip-flops to the right - why wait to be stuck in the middle with you? The ""Scone Set"" @ $10.75. Comes with a pot of tea. The scones are superb. This was a cranberry walnut & candied ginger. Yum! The ""Morning Meal"" @ $8.75 with fruit instead of mixed greens. You can veggie/vegan pretty much anything here, don't forget. 8-11am Breakfast at TSR: The ""Mushroom Tarragon Omelet"" @ $8.95. Not bad.",1
Coffee Shop 69,Red haired woman who greeted us was very unpleasant. She did not seem happy to be there.,0
Coffee Shop 69,"Confession: I don't know the first thing about tea. I know that sometimes it tastes grassy and I know Lipton doesn't count as the real deal, but that's about it. Luckily the Steeping Room caters to people like me. These waitresses know their stuff and they're more than happy to talk/guide you through their intimidating wine-list-length tea menu.  I'd tell you what I got, but I literally don't know what it was. Something with ginger. It didn't taste grassy. I was a happy camper.  Also, those scones are delish. We got two: the rosemary and the ginger, with honey butter. They're soft (none of that stale bakery texture that Americans sometimes think scones have...I'm looking at you, Starbucks). These are the best scones I've had, outside of the ones I make from scratch:)  I wasn't a big fan of the decor of this place, but aside from that the steeping room is a great alternative to my usual coffee shop visits!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Who knew that there was such thing as a TEA Happy Hour? I mean I definitely didn't, this is a wonderful option for our health conscious who don't drink or even for those who are just looking for a day without any alcohol to just chat with their friends. They have plenty of options to choose from for your vegetarian friends to someone who might want something a little more substantial. Also there's a massive list of different types of teas, it's also a cute place to plan a tea party. They are really onto something here at The steeping room since I think it's probably one of the only tea houses in Austin and I really love it and will continue coming back. Service is always great, the food is great, and the environment is relaxing (most of the time) and inviting!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"When I first walked in I was greeted by a display of delicious baked goods. I tried the cranberry and walnut scone! Really flaky and soft! I think it was the perfect amount of sweetness because I don't really like things that are too sweet. Ordered the pork medallion sandwich and tomato soup. The pork medallion sandwich was really freaking good! Very tender and the sauce complemented the meat extremely well. I couldn't really taste the coconut in the tomato coconut soup, but the texture of the tomato soup was amazing. We also ordered the seasonal hummus which was pumpkin flavored!!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"The chai tea is great. Pretty strong ginger taste and other spices. If you like chai, you will love it. More scones Scones",1
Coffee Shop 69,"On a whim my girlfriend and I packed up our dogs and headed up north Lamar to go grab some food and tea at the steeping room. We show up at 4:30, without knowledge that the establishment closes at 5 on sundays, and tentatively asked to be attended to outside. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The menu was large but not intimidating. The vegetarian option on nearly every dish was a huge plus. The tea and coffee selection was right up our alley. With the kind staff and the good food I was happy enough. After placing our order we waited about 5 minutes for a delicious edemame appetizer then an additional 15 minutes for two delicious sandwiches each came with a lightly dressed mixed green salad. The worst part of our experience was that our dogs were being very misbehaved... but that is nobody's fault but ours. Thank you guys!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I had no idea that this location was here!  When I ask google maps for directions to ""the steeping room on north lamar"" it STILL takes me to the Domain location.  The food is excellent and the servers are super friendly, albeit a little slow.  Vegans, vegetarians, meat lovers and picky ones should all be able to find something here.  But make a reservation, this place seems to be busy all the time. Blueberry iced tea. Sweet and tart at the same time. Really good.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"3 check-ins I went to the Steeping Room for the first time with my wife.  She had been before and wanted me to try it out.  It has an interesting feel inside but mostly tea themed as you would imagine.    The food was pretty good, as I didn't know what to expect, but we had breakfast sandwiches and tea.  The tea was a little weak but they were nice enough to remake it and let us steep it ourselves.    The staff here is a really cool and it seems like a good spot to hide out and do some work or just relax while drinking some tea and having some snacks.  Its a bit hidden away in the shopping center its in but if you can find Starbucks you are close by.  The prices on tea are pretty decent too but try a few before buying to be sure you like what you purchase.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"4 check-ins I'm a huge tea drinker, and since I've found the most delicious English Breakfast I've ever had, from here, I'm hooked.  I finally went here to get a bag of loose and decided to try the breakfast. I got the basic B-fast sandy. Add ham and tomato, delicious! Simple and filling. Combine with my tea, I'm happy happy happy.  This is where they earn the stars, tea and food is awesome.  Oh, and staff might not always know tea, but everyone is wonderfully friendly and sweet.  I recently went by to eat with the hub's, and we stayed to consume the awesomeness. The sandwich was the same, good and yummy. We ordered a pot of tea this time, meaning they brewed it. I'll state that I like my coffee and tea both strong, apparently very strong. Our pot tasted watery, really watery.  I asked for more tea to brew it stronger, the pot doesn't have a sieve, instead, they brew and bring just the liquid to the table. (I've never had a place do this, can't say I prefer it). The waiter then came back and mentioned they'll just brew another pot, as brewing longer = bitter. (Her words). I disagree personally, I guess I've been doing it my way for long enough that what they say is bitter doesn't seem to be a problem for me.  So, they re-brew, and ta-dah! we've got tea.  Beautiful, wonderful, tea.   The other waiter came by and mentions that they brew medium, as everyone likes their tea different.( I think it's probably better to just leave the steeping to the customer IMO.) We now know what to ask for, a stronger brew (which is just brewing with a higher quantity of leaves they say). Ok, got it, now I know.  It's still wonderful, with a little kink.  I did purchase a new tea this last time, untasted. Turkish Delight. It was based on a few recommendations a staff member offered. I do not usually enjoy any teas with citurs added or other 'natural flavors'. It's a blend of green and black. I actually really like it. Doesn't need sugar, which I love! And it's a nice finish. Now, this is one I wouldn't want too strong, it's very flavorful.  I'm very excited about this place and I'll be back for sure.",1

Coffee Shop 69,"Listed in Vegetarian/Vegan! Best vegetarian breakfast! I love afternoon tea & light fare, & this place is great for a morning pick me up. I get the breakfast plate with two eggs, vegetarian bacon (smokey tempeh), mixed greens, & a scone! Their savory cheddar scone, as well as the sweet berry are both delicious with their clotted cream. LOVE! I also enjoy their green tea- they have a few selections with toasted and aged leaves & rice. Yum! I prefer this location as opposed to the Domain one, due to parking & the fact that service has always been better here.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Can't vouch for the tea but the food is just meh. I got the croque monsieur which tasted like a fancy grilled cheese I could have made at home, and my husband got the tofu banh mi which really didn't taste like anything other than air, bread and a little sauce they put on it. I'll admit, it was nice to have some vegan/healthy options in a place that seems to only serve brisket, but with meh service, meh food, and high pricing for what you get; I don't think it's worth it.",0
Coffee Shop 69,"I come here all the time, the atmosphere is just as cool as the food.  I really feel I can relax here and even my husband knows to take me her for an immediate de-stress effect.  I HIGHLY recommend the clotted cream and strawberry jam with Currant scones. Don't be stingy with it the flavor profile of a good thick layer is worth the extra calories and a salad for dinner!  My favorite tea choice right now is the English Caramel with some honey and cream. Saved a seat for you! Coming? Perfection! Currant scones with clotted cream butter and strawberry jam. Mmmmmm",1
Coffee Shop 69,"5 check-ins Listed in Tea, tea, and more tea, Allergy-friendly eats in Austin, TX A little more on the side of being a restaurant with really good tea than a tea room per se, this place can get a little crowded around peak meal times.  The menu marks for vegan and gluten-free options, and the staff are great with allergy issues and quite willing to modify things.  The tea menu is extensive and has some very nice choices, and staff are happy to make recommendations.  Service is attentive without being overbearing.  The one thing I'll note is that it can get loud inside and if you want quiet during peak hours, sitting outside is your best bet.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I am normally not one to do Yelp reviews but felt this time I had to. Came to The Steeping Room for lunch with a girlfriend. First of all, the tea menu is huge and awesome and very detailed! We sat outside and had the best service I think I've experienced anywhere in an extremely long time. Our server, Midori was so attentive and sweet! We never had an empty water glass or lag in service at all! Food was great and will be coming back for sure...my main reason for this review was definitely to compliment the service. That alone is enough to keep me as a return customer! Keep up the awesome work guys!!!!!",1
Coffee Shop 69,My mom and I went here for a mother's day brunch and it was just fantastic! The chai tea latte and their breakfast tea was wonderful.

The service was wonderful and the scones are to die for. I would definitely come again.,1
Coffee Shop 69,"I really love this place, especially being mostly a vegetarian I like that there are so many meat free options available.  I love the zen tea service. The napa rolls have really good flavor and also have meat or meat free options as well as good dipping sauces. There is also a side of edamame and the meal  comes with whatever kind of tea you want, which all of their teas have great flavor. And the dessert is fantastic. I took my mom here too and she loved it as well. Great food and atmosphere.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"After making a reservation on their website, I had a lovely lunch at The Steeping Room.  Their selection of teas is incredible.  Today I had the Monaco & found it delicious.  My server was kind & helpful.  Special accolades go to their inventive soups & the cheddar/Rosemary scone.  Just a delightful experience.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Went here for lunch, so this review is based upon that.  Was mildly busy, lots of cougars to look at.  The food was meh, ingredients are fresh, but taste is pretty bland (tomato on sandwich was barely red).  TBLT sandwich is what I ordered with a side of chips.  Service is awfully slow, but I guess that is the atmosphere, stay and hang and chill.  Definitely don't go here for a quick lunch on your one hour lunch break.  I'd go back, but would try something different or maybe go for breakfast I hear it is better.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"It's a lovely little tea and pastry shop, but the service was continuously more and more disappointing as breakfast progressed. I hate writing negative service reviews especially since the food was so fresh and they have lots of GLUTEN FREE pastry options, but the service was AWFUL. They always have one GF scone, carrot cake cupcake, and a GF cookie with other various daily specials which was very exciting for me being GF. The scone and cupcake that I tried where delicious!",0

They accommodate most dietary restrictions, the service is great and the staff is lovely, the tea continues to be delicious (my current fave is the Mojteato - so refreshing!), and the food is consistent and tasty. Favorites on the menu are the smoked salmon and cucumber tea sandwiches, the ginger scones, anything on the breakfast menu, the potato pancakes on the brunch menu, and anything with their black rice. The Steeping Room is a gem, and this location is really hopping. Word to the wise - if you're going at peak times, call in advance for a reservation. It's that popular.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"This place is like heaven. All the food is so delish, you just want to hang out, sip tea and nibble on the good eats. Food: The stratta is melt in your mouth, write home to mom delish...but it is very heavy and probably not low cal... The cabbage rolls are to die for, and all I could think of was the cabbage cleansing out my intestines. The salads are wonderful and fresh, the soups fresh and healthy, too. I recommend the Jasmine Pearl tea, and you get two pots!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Listed in So, you wanna eat in North Central Austin? Tea and brunch. What could be better??  The hostess was nice, we were seated and helped immediately. The tea was fantastic (I had the peach oolong), and the food was extremely delicious. I had the morning breakfast service that comes with two eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit, a scone, a pot of tea and some tea cookies. Potatoes were excellent, eggs were a little undercooked for my taste, bacon was cooked well.. but the superstar was the fruit. Raspberries, pear slices, apple slices, blackberries, blueberries, banana, and pineapple. All of it so fresh and flavorful. The berry spelt scone also rocked with some clotted cream and jam.  My S.O. had the B.A.T.E. - bacon, arugula, tomato, and egg on ciabatta. He scarfed it down along with the house hot sauce that he loved.  Vegan, vegetarian, and GF options.  Why four stars? The tables for two are tiny and it gets really crowded with two pots of tea and plates. Also, they are really close together. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the conversation next to us hadn't been so annoying. Totally ruined the ambiance. B.a.t.e Morning breakfast service",1
Coffee Shop 69,"2 check-ins Listed in 100 Yelp Review Challenge I came here and ordered coffee because I'm stupid. I should have ordered tea. oh well! They gave me coffee happily and didn't act like I was weird.  On this lovely visit I mingled with my totes favorite yelpers and got to see what's so special about The Steeping Room. They have some pretty awesome food!  I got the Seasonal Scrambler, the eggs were scrambled with potato, caramelized onions, and basil and bahhhh they were really good eggs.  But I wouldn't get the same thing next time, I'd get whatever Jenny got. Maybe the vegan breakfast sandwich? or the BAT sandwich? Both are vegan I guess, and I'm not vegan... so it looks like they do vegan pretty daaaang good.  See ya again sometime, Steeping Room! The scrambler",1
Coffee Shop 69,"6 check-ins Let me start by saying that since I was introduced to the Salted Toffee Cookie, no other cookie exists! It's like you died and went to cookie heaven. While there, you see Cookie Monster and he tries to take your cookie and you stab him in the hand and say ""No, Cookie Monster, This is my cookie!"" It's good enough for even a dream sequence!  Wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable, which is good because there are, what seems like 1,367,468 types of tea to choose from and having a helping hand in deciding is very helpful.  Food for me is good, but there are only a few things that I would consider putting in my mouth, ie. Kale, tempeh, tofu nuggets etc.  My friends that do like that stuff say it's amazing, so we'll go with that.  Lastly, if you go around lunch prepare to fight to the death for parking, it gets a little cut-throat! Otherwise, relax, sit back and enjoy that tea and Salted Toffee Cookie. However, if it's close to my cookie, prepare to battle and lose! That cookie is MINE!!!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"This is a great restaurant. I think they do a disservice to themselves by appearing to be a tea house. It took us forever to figure out it was a great restaurant, and tea was just part of what they do! The ingredients are fresh, local, organic. Real chef-level thought out food. I love the salads. Best I've had in Austin. I can always find great gluten free options. The brunch is also great for gluten free options. Always impressed. I don't have a favorite dish yet. Still trying one out new things each time I go. The staff is wonderful and never tires of my many questions. This location is nice and relaxing. (The domain location is loud and bustling, but you can sit outside, so pick your vibe.)",1
Coffee Shop 69,"This is one of the best places to eat in Austin if you're celiac. They will clean the preparation surface for you. Besides that, they have friendly waiters and tasty food. It's also my favorite coffee in Austin. They brew each mug fresh, which is how coffee should be!",1
Coffee Shop 69,Good service. Good food. Prices are too expensive and I wish there were more vegan options.,1
Coffee Shop 69,"My favorite tea is the Jasmine blueberry green tea and a bacon spinach crustless tea sandwich that came with a salad.  The sandwich and salad were good but nothing special. Service was good.  Although I do love this place, I feel that the food portions are small considering what you are paying.  I prefer the other location, but I would come back to this one.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"This is my favorite tea place in Austin! Very vegan friendly. They always have a vegan soup, the tomato coconut bisque is super yummy! I absolutely crave the tempeh-bacon arugala & tomato tea sammie with balsalmic greens and a vegan currant scone. They also have some of the best chocolate cupcakes in town. :D",1
Coffee Shop 69,"4 check-ins Listed in Vegan and the Beast I've been here several times with friends.  What? You haven't?!  Don't be ridick! You totes have to try the Steeping Room!  Get the vegan breakfast sandwich. It's sort of like a banh mi, but like all whited up.  You know, white bread with the crust cut off sort of thing. And hummus is on it. Ask for extra sriracha and cilantro.  The majority of the waitstaff is super, but one time, we did have a girl that just seemed like she hated her job, or maybe was having an awful day (at 8am).  Ooh, and the BAT sandwich (bacon, arugula and tomato with basil mayo) is fantastic. Vegan style, and they make their own tempeh bacon that is cold smoked.  Damn it, people, you're a big pile of genius.  And that super bacon? Freaking gluten free, too. And vegan basil mayonnaise? It's so simple, but I want to marry the person at Steeping Room who came up with that, and then divorce them, because that's what I do.  They also have pastries and muffins and whatnots, all clearly marked for specialty diets.  They have tea. Buuuuuut, I don't care.  Why not all the stars? The restaurants temperature is so weird.  It's cold! It's hot! It's freezing! What the hell? Tofu tempeh sandwich. Vegan basil mayo! See all photos from Jenny L. for The Steeping Room",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I had the best experience at this restaurant!  Jordan was out waitress and she was so awesome.  I am doing a no sugar challenge and she went out of her way to make sure I was ordering food items without sugar!!!  So happy.  Great food, great service.  Definitely will be back!",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge HOLLA!!!!, SUGAR?!!! WHERE?!, Breakfast: the most important meal of the day So fun fact about myself. At one point in life I was a hardcore coffee drinker and drank around 6 cups a day. I had a major caffeine overload in undergrad after pulling 3 all nighters in a row and could barely finish my last exam because my hands were shaking so badly. Since then I've stopped drinking coffee BUT now I'm pretty much addicted to Diet Coke and tea.... out of the frying pan and into the fire much?  So personally I really like breakfast blend and Earl Grey teas. My favorite tea blend is the St. Regis blend which they serve at Afternoon tea at the St. Regis (hmm reminds me to review them). I have a theory that it's a mix between breakfast blend and Earl Grey.... anyway back to the point. I stopped by the Steeping Room because I was told it was the Austin equivalent of a tea service. With that in mind we ordered a pot of the Breakfast blend.  Interestingly enough this place is vegan so I was a bit taken aback when I was offered my choice of almond milk or 2% with my tea.... interesting. I chose both just to see what it would be like. I'm used to actually taking cream versus milk with my tea. It allows me to add less while still mellowing out the harsh tones of a black blend. The Breakfast blend was solid, a great early morning starter tea.  For food we ordered the Scone set and chose the walnut-cranberry scone and the spiced apricot scone. We also had clotted cream with it (it comes with strawberry preserves). I ordered the mushroom tarragon omelette with the greens and my companion ordered the morning meal with fruit. The scones were great. They were soft, buttery, and paired beautifully with the cream and preserves. My Omelette was stellar as well. Here's a tip: the omelette comes with a substantial amount of goat cheese which is great if you like goat cheese and extremely generous of them but personally it was a bit much for me. It's just something to note.  Eventually we decided to order a second pot of tea and took our server's suggestion. To be honest I felt like our server was new as she didn't seem very familiar with the tea blends or the contents of the menu. She recommended the Christmas blend. I guess the best way to put it is to say that this kind of tea isn't up my alley. There's a certain kind of person who prefers slightly bitter black teas (breakfast blends, earl greys, jasmine tea, etc) and there's a certain kind of person who prefers sweet, minty, fruity blends. This was a pretty sweet, minty, and very cinnamon-heavy tea. Would I have chosen it? No. Was it bad? Not really. Would I get it again? No.  For what it offers this place is great for Austin. It had a nice ambiance and it's distinctive in Austin's varied food scene. I'd like to come back sometime and try their regular lunch. Scone set Mushroom Tarragon Omelette",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I went to the steeping room today for an early lunch. Every employee was super sweet and helpful. My server Shelby was great with helping me choose my tea. Went with the Jasmine Green tea which was so good I even got one to go when I left! For lunch I had the Vegan Tofu Tempeh Bacon Sandwich. It was the best tempeh bacon sandwich I have had! And I have tried quite a lot of them. Most places overdo the flavoring of tempeh and tofu but The Steeping Room really got it right. It was light and had the perfect amount of flavor and the side Cashew Ceasar salad was amazing too. I would have that salad for my entire meal.  I will definitely be recommending this place and becoming a regular. Although they probably don't need the recommendation because the restaurant was full by the time I left!  Great place for people with any dietary restrictions as well! They offer Gluten Free, Vegetarian and Vegan options.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I am someone that hates going out for food bc a lot of times I feel like I could've made that better at home to my liking (and cheaper). Not the case here at all! I had an excellent experience here with a combination of the food and service and of course great company.  We sat in Jennifer's section (pretty sure that was her name, it's been two weeks) who only works at this (Lamar) location on Wednesdays. She was patient, knowledgeable about the menu and restaurant, fun to talk to but also let us do our own thing, attentive to our needs with refills etc. and just an overall awesome human being! Since it was my first time, she even bought us our dessert, which is such a sweet thing to do!!!  That tea selection is heavenly and I got a little overwhelmed because I wanted 10 different ones and most places don't even have 5 options let alone 50!  Foodwise, I felt like I had a ""When Harry Met Sally"" moment in the restaurant, except my foodgasm was real! I'm still dreaming about their red lentil soup....OMG so yummy, I want that everyday for the rest of my life now, move over bfast tacos! We also got their special for the day which was a chicken and rice and probably the best chicken and rice i've had (sorry mum). Was flavourful and zesty, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the rice was the right amount of fluff and softness. The best part was that It gave the effect of feeling like you ate super healthy because it's not greasy and you feel light afterwards. Ohhh that dessert, that chocolate caramel cake should be for 4people, but the two of us gobbled it down and I knew I'd want more. Also felt light for a cake so rich!  TELL ME HOW YOU DO IT?!  Just stop what you're doing and go to the steeping room, thank me later.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Great service with unimaginative and uneventful food that tastes frozen or pre-bought. I'd recommend the Steeping Room for a cup of tea but that would be about it.  Good: 1. Service was excellent. 2. The nora, spring rolls were quiet good. However, the tofu in them tasted baked or fried which was offsetting given that spring rolls should be vibrant and light tasting.  Bad: 1. Vegetable curry dish with chicken added. The dish arrived with small pieces of chicken sitting atop the curry dish; it was not even added into the dish to be cooked. The curry was boring and had no real flavor. The chicken was extremely dried out and hardened, almost what you would expect from rice being overcooked. 2. Chocolate caramel cake was dull and tasted store bought to have been apparently ""made in house"", which I now assume means someone putting it on a plate. The only caramel to the cake was a small drizzle on the plate. 3. Very pricey IMO for the quality of the food you receive. 4. My wife had the ginger tofu sandwich and said it lacked any and all ginger flavor.",0
Coffee Shop 69,Great selection of teas to purchase for home as well as a variety of both coffee & tea to brew while there. Highly recommend the chocolate chipotle chai! Chocolate chipotle chai,1
Coffee Shop 69,"2 check-ins I go here almost every week for my masala chai fix. The wait time for a table can range up to an hour or more on weekends, an online reservation is recommended around lunch time. On weekday nights, I've not had to wait for a table. The staff is always friendly but service can be quite slow during busy hours, since the kitchen is quite small. For Sunday brunch, I usually get the gravlax and latkes if I get there early enough (they run out of it!). I also enjoy the croque monsieur, Monte Cristo sandwiches and the Bangkok daily bowl. For dessert, I either get the seasonal creme brulee or the matcha dusted brownie.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Went here for lunch today with Lauren H. and baby C. Called ahead and made a reservation, which I would advise doing as the place is small and we still had to wait a few minutes for our table. Once seated, we placed our order. I got a pot of the hibiscus tea and it was delicious...and since it was raining on and off outside, perfect for the weather. I ordered the rustica salad, which was plentiful and flavorful. Lauren ordered the chicken salad sandwich. The portions are healthy and the service was superb. Certainly a great way to have a ladies lunch this rainy afternoon! Rustica salad",1
Coffee Shop 69,"A few complaints about a wonderful little restaurant:  The TBLT (Turkey, Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato) sandwich isn't very good, partly because the turkey is tasteless, but mainly because the tomato slices are too thick, there's way too much mayonnaise, AND the romaine leaves include the rib, the thick part of the center - all of which, predictably, makes the whole sandwich fall apart. BLTs (+ turkey) are an easily mastered art.  The Strata is not always completely cooked.  The Masala Bowl is disappointing.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"I got the Chipotle Chocolate Chai tea and it was amazing. My tea sandwiches (pork) were so savory and I've never had fresher greens in my salad. The service was wonderful, all the servers and workers were so helpful and happy. It was a very peaceful atmosphere. I got some Jasmine Green Tea leaves to brew at home and am very happy with it.",1
Coffee Shop 69,Same great tea and food as their Domain location but roomier and with closer and easier parking. I especially love their pine nut plum scones with jam or clotted cream. The one downside is the huge windowed front facing Lamar which is great on a cloudy but when sunny it fills the restaurant such that you have squint in almost any seat.,1
Coffee Shop 69,This place is amazing! It's one of my favorite Austin spots to hit! Everyone is totally great and on top of helping their customers. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice spot,1
Coffee Shop 69,"I come here when I visit my friend in Austin for a fun place with lots of yummy options. It gets 4 stars for having great food, but I will say I don't think it's all entirely fairly priced, and the service is pretty irregular. The waitstaff is pleasant but not super attentive or responsive. We ordered a tea set to split between us and were only brought one tea cup... and it took about 10 minutes for my friend to get a second cup. But, if you don't mind it, the food is still super tasty and the atmosphere is bright and chatty.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"After noticing many friends have come here and really enjoyed it, I decided to take a couple of out of town friends here for brunch.  It was definitely a great choice.  Having it been the first time here it was a little confusing between counter service and table service.  That said, if you dine in it IS table service.  I opted for the savory scone sandwich with cheddar, ham and eggs.  I had something similar while in Nashville and it was honestly a Top 5 breakfast ever.  That said, I thought my breakfast was tasty and super savory but it seemed a bit steep of price for what it was in actuality.  The vibe here is kind of weird.  I would go into further detail but don't want to sound crass.  I'll be coming back for sure as we were all VERY happy with everything we had.",1
Coffee Shop 69,Great food! I haven't had a meal I did not enjoy here. It's very clean and great for people with dietary restrictions.,1
Coffee Shop 69,"I actually step into this restaurant by chance and now is one of my favorites in Austin. I ordered Budha Bowl Java Bowl, Hummus and a couple of teas. I really liked Budha Bowl, the black rice specially, and the best of all that it was super gentle with my stomach and digestion, I felt happy. The Java Bowl was also ok, although the chicken it had was cold and I'm not a fan of cold chicken. This plate came with a sauce that was actually good. I think the best one I tried on the different restaurants I visited while in Austin. This restaurant specializes on teas. And they have really good ones. I ordered Moroccan and Raspberry Iced. Loved both.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Ok, The Steeping Room IS awesome. How do they have so many great menu items. Of course they have LOTS of teas, but they have numerous gluten free AND vegan choices. Thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU. Ok if there is one complaint, it is that there is no steeping room in south Austin, east Austin or Westlake. Love you guys.",1
Coffee Shop 69,"Loved coming here for tea, and the atmosphere was pretty and fresh. I ordered the strawberry herbal tea, and my friend had the scone and eggs.",1
Coffee Shop 69,I finally stopped in for lunch with my colleague and I'm so glad we did. I had a delicious coconut milk soup and a chai tea. Yum!,1
