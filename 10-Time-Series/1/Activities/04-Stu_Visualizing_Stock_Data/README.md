# Visualizing Stock Data

## Background

You want to move forward in your analysis of Tesla Motor stock, so you decide to investigate how the TSLA stock behaves in the US stock market on different dates and times. You resolve to use your slicing and data visualization skills to create a report to share with your team and to ask them for feedback.

## Instructions

In this activity, you’ll use the Tesla stock data that you used in an earlier activity. The first part of the starter Jupyter notebook recalls preparing the data and setting the time zone. Review the initial section, and then continue with the following steps:

1. Set the “time” column as the DataFrame index.

2. Plot the closing prices of the TSLA stock.

3. Using the `loc` function, zoom in to 2020 to inspect the TSLA closing prices.

4. Using the `loc` function, plot the closing prices from August and September 2020.

5. Using the `loc` function, plot the closing prices from August 22 and September 5, 2020.
