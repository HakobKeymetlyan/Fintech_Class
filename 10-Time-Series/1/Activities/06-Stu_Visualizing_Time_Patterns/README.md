# Analyzing Time Series Patterns in the S&P 500 Index

In this activity, you’ll gain additional practice working with the hvPlot grouped plots.

## Instructions

Using the Starter code provided, complete the following:

1. Read the S&P 500 volume data into a DataFrame. (Make sure to declare the `datetime` index).

2. Slice the DataFrame so that it just includes the volume data.

3. Using hvPlot, plot the volume data according to the day of the week to answer the following question: In what day does trading in the S&P 500 tend to be the most active?

4. Using hvPlot, visualize the hourly trends for each day of the week in the form of a heatmap. Based on that, does any day-of-week pattern concentrate in just a few hours of a particular day?

5. Using hvPlot, create a plot that shows the data grouped by the calendar week in the year (week of year). Does the share trading intensity tend to increase at any particular part of the calendar year?
