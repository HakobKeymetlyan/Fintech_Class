# Assessing Market Opportunities for Alpaca Wool Scarves: Data Preparation

In this activity, you’ll prepare the data to be used for time series forecasting to analyze Google Trends data. The purpose is to validate market opportunities to help the Aymara indigenous people in Bolivia export alpaca wool scarves to different countries or regions.

You’ll continue collaborating with the International Co-operative Alliance. But now, you’ll use Prophet to validate prospective market opportunities.

## Instructions

1. Open Google Colaband import the provided starter notebook.

2. Read the Google Trends data into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Plot the general trends.

4. Prepare the data to fit the Prophet model. Create two new DataFrames: one for Canada and another for Uruguay. Remember to set the column names to “ds” for the dates and “y” for the trend values.

   **Hint:** You can use the [Pandas rename function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html) to set the column names as requested.
